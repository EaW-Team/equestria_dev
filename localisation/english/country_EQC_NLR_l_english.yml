 ### FOCUS ###
 EQC_NLR_reorganise_the_government:0 "Reorganise the Government"
 EQC_NLR_reorganise_the_government_desc:0 "Jet Set has been allowed to remain in power, though he must prove his loyalty to Nightmare Moon. His peers, on the other hoof, cannot be trusted and must be replaced by reliable Lunarists. Many of these are likely to be thestrals, who were always cheated out of positions of power during Celestia's rule."
 EQC_NLR_welcome_refugees:0 "Welcome Civil War Refugees"
 EQC_NLR_welcome_refugees_desc:0 "The Civil War has displaced many ponies from their homes. These refugees are often left completely destitute, victims of the destruction that the war has brought to all corners of Equestria. Thankfully, New Mareland was spared from the ravages of war. In the name of friendship, we should take in as many refugees as we can. Resettling them here will likely benefit us in the long run."
 EQC_NLR_fleeing_capital:0 "Poach the Fleeing Capital"
 EQC_NLR_fleeing_capital_desc:0 "With Equestria torn apart, numerous rich ponies are fleeing their homes with whatever valuables they can carry. Many are heading for greener pastures elsewhere in the hopes of finding safety. As a part of Equestria never touched by the war, we are in a prime position to move in and secure both the ponies and their capital."
 EQC_NLR_the_rule_of_law:0 "Reaffirm Secular Rule"
 EQC_NLR_the_rule_of_law_desc:0 "Nightmare Moon has established her rule across Equestria, but many ponies in New Mareland still refuse to worship her. In the interest of pragmatism, and to spare the nation from any further religious conflict, we will endorse a firm separation of religion from government. The last thing we need is more violence."
 EQC_NLR_new_education_reforms:0 "Nopony Left Behind"
 EQC_NLR_new_education_reforms_desc:0 "We claim to be a developed nation with strong educational institutions. Yet there are many creatures on the margins of our society that lack access to a quality education. We need national standards for education, and standardized testing to ensure that those standards are met. Every foal should have the opportunity to learn at a decent school."
 EQC_NLR_introduce_new_currency:0 "The Imperial Bit"
 EQC_NLR_introduce_new_currency_desc:0 "Celestia was a benevolent overlord who allowed us a great deal of autonomy. One way we exercised that autonomy was by minting our own currency. However, Nightmare Moon has signaled that she would like us to work towards centralizing power within her Empire. In order to appease her and improve relations with our overlord, we will adopt a common currency: the Imperial Bit."
 EQC_NLR_bat_equality:0 "Pass the Thestral Citizenship Act"
 EQC_NLR_bat_equality_desc:0 "There are three tribes, ponies have been taught. Not entirely correct. A fourth tribe, the thestrals, has lived in the shadows, isolated from the rest of our society. They shall be pariahs no more! We will recognize them as true citizens of New Mareland and grant them all the associated rights and privileges. A nation that does not take care of all its people is no nation at all."
 EQC_NLR_new_constitution:0 "Constitutional Rule"
 EQC_NLR_new_constitution_desc:0 "There is one law that stands above all else, even orders from the Empress: the Constitution of New Mareland. It is the supreme law of the land, and our people consider it almost sacrosanct. We shall not allow anything to circumvent it. Even if the light of democracy goes out all across the world and equine rights become nothing but a whisper, we will remain a nation of laws and uphold our Constitution."
 EQC_NLR_infrastrucutre_improvements:0 "Inter-Mareland Highway System"
 EQC_NLR_infrastrucutre_improvements_desc:0 "A new proposal is causing quite a stir within our government. It calls for the construction of a controlled-access highway system to connect the disparate parts of New Mareland. Although the plan is a bit ambitious, it has many potential benefits. Once this highway system is constructed, we will have one of the most advanced transportation networks on the continent."
 EQC_NLR_parks:0 "Parks and Recreation Act"
 EQC_NLR_parks_desc:0 "Strength through Joy. A common slogan throughout the world, but for us it needs to be more than a slogan. We need places that ponies can visit on holidays, or just for a weekend when urban life gets to be too much. Places that can act as small sanctuaries outside of our cities. Several swathes of forest and prime lakefront property will be protected from development in order to preserve them for the future."
 EQC_NLR_independence_negotiations:0 "Independence Negotiations"
 EQC_NLR_independence_negotiations_desc:0 "We are bound to the Lunar Empire as we once were to Equestria. However, there are many inefficiencies inherent in governing a nation an ocean away from the metropole. This reality is being recognized by officials on both sides of the Celestial Ocean more and more everyday. Jet Set has decided that the time is right to travel across the sea and negotiate a new arrangement that works for both parties."
 EQC_NLR_protect_the_nation:0 "Protect the Nation"
 EQC_NLR_protect_the_nation_desc:0 "We may have no interest in interfering with Griffonian politics, but we also cannot ignore the threat of a possible invasion either. A defensive line along our borders must be constructed, to keep our nation and our way of life safe from anything that may threaten it. Should war come to our homeland, New Mareland will endure."
 EQC_NLR_regulated_shadowbolts:0 "A Friendlier Shadowbolt Society"
 EQC_NLR_regulated_shadowbolts_desc:0 "There are many reasons why ponies don't really like the Shadowbolts. Their secrecy, all the stories that the rumour mill is peddling everyday about some arcane, bestialic ritual. This cannot be allowed to continue and grow even worse. We need to open the Shadowbolts up to the camera. If nothing else, it will at least give the impression that it is nothing but a club for ponies with too much time."
 EQC_NLR_shadowbolt_investment:0 "Friends in Dark Places"
 EQC_NLR_shadowbolt_investment_desc:0 "The Shadowbolts are very useful for things the government cannot be seen openly doing. As a private society, whatever the Shadowbolts get up to is not officially our business unless it is illegal. If they happen to make choice investments that the government would not normally be able to, well, that's their business. So what if it just so happens to benefit us both?"
 EQC_NLR_new_oil_projects:0 "The Empire's Oil Well"
 EQC_NLR_new_oil_projects_desc:0 "Below New Mareland lie great oil reserves, undisturbed since they were discovered several years ago. With the Empress recently ordering a focus on autarky, it is time to put those oil reserves to good use. While we cannot match the Imperial heartland's industrial or agricultural output, we can deliver the liquid that keeps the modern world running smoothly."
 EQC_NLR_shadowbolts_focus:0 "The Shadowbolt Society"
 EQC_NLR_shadowbolts_focus_desc:0 "Legend says the Shadowbolt Society was founded a thousand years ago by the original Shadowbolts who served Nightmare Moon. Others say the name is pure coincidence. What is true, however, is that the many of the most influential ponies in New Mareland are members of this Society and they have no qualms with assisting Nightmare Moon if it means keeping their heads."
 EQC_NLR_the_new_shadowbolts:0 "The New Society"
 EQC_NLR_the_new_shadowbolts_desc:0 "We shall not be the Shadowbolts of old. The times are changing, and the world is changing with them. We must adapt to new circumstances and make sure that we do not fall behind, lest we become a relic of the past like so many other societies before us. We must, in the words of another pony, adapt or die."
 EQC_NLR_the_old_shadowbolts:0 "A Return to Our Roots"
 EQC_NLR_the_old_shadowbolts_desc:0 "The Winds of Change are blowing across New Mareland. Yet they are, in the wider sense, irrelevant. The largess and glamour of change does not compare to the old ways which have served us so well for the past several centuries. When the winds blow, we stand fast in our place, refusing to bend to pressure from within and without."
 EQC_NLR_industrial_security_act:0 "The Industrial Security Act"
 EQC_NLR_industrial_security_act_desc:0 "Around New Mareland, many companies are teetering on the brink of collapse. They have not been able to find enough contracts or customers to keep the lights on ever since Black Wednesday. What seemed like a lost year has turned into a lost decade. But there is hope. If we can support and secure our industry, and make sure that the failures do not drag the rest down, we might make it out of this alive."
 EQC_NLR_implement_corporatism:0 "Shadowbolt Capitalism"
 EQC_NLR_implement_corporatism_desc:0 "The businessponies of New Mareland have a lot in common with us. Immense wealth, a desire to operate free of constraints, and a good understanding of our place in the world. Yet nopony has reached out to set up a more permanent relationship between us two. One that may turn out to be very fruitful for both parties."
 EQC_NLR_use_the_cinema:0 "The Birth of Mareland"
 EQC_NLR_use_the_cinema_desc:0 "There are many new ways of getting a message out to the masses, and none has proven more effective than motion pictures. The way that we can massage public opinion for or against an idea or purpose is a wonderful tool that has been unavailable until now. With many internal issues still plaguing our country, it is likely to be a very useful tool in the near future."
 EQC_NLR_an_industrial_education:0 "Industrial Education"
 EQC_NLR_an_industrial_education_desc:0 "We must build a strong educational system in New Mareland to ensure a new future for the nation. What is needed is not just the old academic establishment, or the industrial sector that we have currently, but one that will remain competitive in the future. We need an industrial future, one of highly-educated workers that can churn out the machines of today and tomorrow."
 EQC_NLR_family_programs:0 "Encourage Family Programs"
 EQC_NLR_family_programs_desc:0 "If there is one unit from which everything springs, it is the family. The family operates as the core unit of society, and it should be protected and empowered. Encouraging individual families to set up their own programmes and small shops might just be the thing we are looking for."
 EQC_NLR_corporate_militarism:0 "Corporate Militarism"
 EQC_NLR_corporate_militarism_desc:0 "New Mareland has always had a robust heavy and secondary industry. Steel and aluminium are produced in abundance here. Though they are primarily used by civilians, they also have a military application. Planes that carry cargo can also carry bombs. We need to make the companies aware of this, and note that a number of contracts might go their way if they take advantage of this opportunity."
 EQC_NLR_economic_shocktherapy:0 "Economic Shock Therapy"
 EQC_NLR_economic_shocktherapy_desc:0 "There are several parts of the economy which are running at a sluggish pace. This is not confined to one industry, but spread across multiple sectors. In this environment we can't afford to have an economy running at half speed. We must rapidly loosen regulations so that the markets can breathe freely once more."
 EQC_NLR_grant_bats_equality:0 "Embrace the Thestrals"
 EQC_NLR_grant_bats_equality_desc:0 "When the Civil War began, there was one tribe that was almost universally loyal to the Nightmare. The thestrals served the Empress faithfully, and were rewarded handsomely across the ocean. But they have not yet been rewarded here. This is a grave injustice that must be rectified. The thestrals shall be granted full equality with other ponies of New Mareland."
 EQC_NLR_convinct_leasing:0 "Convict Leasing"
 EQC_NLR_convinct_leasing_desc:0 "There is a severe shortage of skilled workers in our nation, and even less cash to go around thanks to the war. Fortunately, there is a very large population of "willing" workers ready to work day and night without any sense of such things as unions or higher wages. The prisoners of New Mareland will finally have a way to repay their debt to society."
 EQC_NLR_local_shadowbolt_lodges:0 "The Fourth Branch of Government"
 EQC_NLR_local_shadowbolt_lodges_desc:0 "Schoolfoals are taught that we have a legislative, executive and judicial branch of government. Three in one. But what happens when they end up in a fight? What happens when they cannot agree? This is where the Shadowbolts come in. As the arbiter of their members, to which almost all ponies of note belong, they are in a unique position to mediate between squabbling branches whenever necessary."
 EQC_NLR_put_the_griffons_in_their_place:0 "Pass the Alien and Sedition Act"
 EQC_NLR_put_the_griffons_in_their_place_desc:0 "Though our rule seems safe, there are enemies all around us. Aliens go around the nation, plotting the very destruction of New Mareland. They live among us, never once showing their true allegiance until they decide to strike. We must strike first, and make sure that they will not be able to carry out their plans."
 EQC_NLR_the_elders:0 "Protocols of the Elders of Griffonstone"
 EQC_NLR_the_elders_desc:0 "There are many books that tell of the griffons beyond our borders. One of the newer ones is one from an unknown author, and it describes a plan the griffons have laid in secret to dominate not just Griffonia, but the entire world. If we do not stay vigilant, this horrible plan may come to fruition. Griffons may well be a fifth column within our land that must be rooted out."
 EQC_NLR_extend_membership:0 "Expand the Shadowbolt Society"
 EQC_NLR_extend_membership_desc:0 "The Shadowbolts in their current form have served us well. However as their influence grows, so does the need for more members to take care of the many, many, machinations in progress. We need to take charge and push for an increased membership to make sure that the organization can fulfill its purpose."
 EQC_NLR_united_shadow_works:0 "United Shadow Works"
 EQC_NLR_united_shadow_works_desc:0 "Many of New Mareland's largest corporations are run by members of the Shadowbolt Society. Now that the Society is overseeing the nation, these assets can be safely nationalised into one single Shadowbolt corporation. After all, nothing will really change."
 EQC_NLR_status_of_the_society:0 "Status of the Society"
 EQC_NLR_status_of_the_society_desc:0 "The Shadowbolt Society was originally created with the intention to serve Nightmare Moon as her loyal subjects, and nothing more. Yet, with new territory on Griffonia coming under Lunar dominion, it is clear that we may have to play a larger role than originally intended. To that end, the Empress has seen fit to grant us more autonomy, so that we may better handle affairs on the continent."
 EQC_NLR_embrace_the_night:0 "Embrace the Night"
 EQC_NLR_embrace_the_night_desc:0 "Nopony in New Mareland can be trusted with the position of Governor-General. Her Imperial Majesty has seen fit to send a pony whose loyalty to the night is unquestionable: Evening Dew. He shall ensure that the colony becomes an integral part of the Lunar Empire."
 EQC_NLR_coopt_the_shadowbolts:0 "Radicalise the Shadowbolt Society"
 EQC_NLR_coopt_the_shadowbolts_desc:0 "The Shadowbolts are a good place to start. They are already loyal to us, and have a core of dedicated members that we can work to expand. However, they are lacking in dedication to the Empress. We must make them see the error of their ways. Soon they will serve Her Imperial Majesty with the zealous devotion she deserves."
 EQC_NLR_scientific_modernisation:0 "Eliminate Scientific Boundaries"
 EQC_NLR_scientific_modernisation_desc:0 "The dogmatic idea that some things cannot be done in the name of science needs to be done away with. We are on the verge of achieving several breakthroughs that will significantly improve our civilian and military technology. Morality cannot be allowed to stop us from enjoying the fruits of our labour. When it comes to scientific progress, the ends always justify the means."
 EQC_NLR_immediate_equality:0 "Thestral Equality Edict"
 EQC_NLR_immediate_equality_desc:0 "The thestral cause is very important to our Empress. It was the campaign for thestral rights that led her to finally shed the weak form of Luna. As Her Imperial Majesty's representative, Evening Dew has issued an edict requiring that thestrals be integrated into all aspects of society from which they have previously been excluded. Batponies may now come out of the shadows and into the glorious moonlight!"
 EQC_NLR_imperial_donation:0 "An Imperial Donation"
 EQC_NLR_imperial_donation_desc:0 "Her Imperial Majesty has graciously decided to help our ailing economy through an infusion of capital from Manehattan's largest banks. We will direct these funds to our most vulnerable industries and, hopefully, revitalize them. We must also thank the Empress for making such a generous gift to her most unworthy subjects in this time of strife. Her benevolence is boundless!"
 EQC_NLR_national_rebirth:0 "One Nation Under the Nightmare"
 EQC_NLR_national_rebirth_desc:0 "New Mareland can no longer afford to be a dysfunctional nation where ponies are always at each other's throats. We must unite the people of this colony through faith and devotion to the Empress. Every New Marelander should be proud to serve Her Imperial Majesty and contribute to the glory of the Lunar Empire."
 EQC_NLR_the_wickedness_of_griffonkind:0 "The Wickedness of Griffonkind"
 EQC_NLR_the_wickedness_of_griffonkind_desc:0 "Griffons are known throughout the world as a loathsome species. In the Riverlands, griffons are seen as savage invaders who commit unspeakably cruel acts of violence. In the west, griffon merchants are known as the most corrupt and conniving creatures to ever exist. They are, in every way, the natural enemies of equinity. Everypony in New Mareland must learn the truth about these monstrous barbarians."
 EQC_NLR_the_nightmares_eyes:0 "The Eyes of the Nightmare"
 EQC_NLR_the_nightmares_eyes_desc:0 "The ponies of New Mareland now live under the watchful eyes of the Empress. Her Imperial Majesty will always be there to protect them from savage griffons and tyrannical solarists. However, her protection requires obedience in return. We must ensure that all ponies insufficiently loyal to the Empress are dealt with."
 EQC_NLR_coopt_the_segregationists:0 "The Picket-Dew Pact"
 EQC_NLR_coopt_the_segregationists_desc:0 "Picket Fence and Evening Dew are two ponies who shouldn't have anything in common. One advocates for New Mareland's independence, while the other is fiercely loyal to Her Imperial Majesty. Yet there is one issue on which they are in complete agreement: the griffon problem. Evening has decided to meet with Picket to see if there is any room for cooperation between them."
 EQC_NLR_work_camps_for_griffons:0 "Redemption Camps"
 EQC_NLR_work_camps_for_griffons_desc:0 "The griffons are loathsome creatures who have absolutely no right to live in New Mareland. Yet they are still creatures with a brain and two limbs that can be made to work. As dangerous as they are to our society, it would be a shame to let so much potential labor go to waste. They will be given a chance to redeem their species by working off their crimes in heavily guarded labor camps."
 EQC_NLR_national_tithe:0 "The National Tithe"
 EQC_NLR_national_tithe_desc:0 "New Mareland's tax code is infamous for being very long and unwieldy. We should reform it by trimming it down and imposing a flat tax on the income of our subjects. The Governor-General fully supports this proposal, insisting that we call the new tax Her Imperial Majesty's Tithe. While this may decrease government revenue in the short run, the boost to the economy will make it worthwhile."
 EQC_NLR_expel_the_savages:0 "Expel the Savages"
 EQC_NLR_expel_the_savages_desc:0 "It is time to take the final step towards solving the griffon problem. We no longer have any use for these vile creatures, and our subjects are eager to cleanse them from our land. We will show them the smallest bit of mercy by offering a choice: leave the country immediately, or face extermination."
 EQC_NLR_soldiers_of_the_night:0 "Soldiers of the Night"
 EQC_NLR_soldiers_of_the_night_desc:0 "When Evening Dew arrived in New Mareland, the colony's army was a paltry colonial force. Small and weak, it was entirely insufficient for serving Her Imperial Majesty. Now, through extensive reforms and conscription, it has become something far greater. New Mareland's soldiers shall be known throughout the Empire as the elite vanguard of the Nightmare."
 EQC_NLR_the_prophet:0 "The Prophet"
 EQC_NLR_the_prophet_desc:0 "Evening Dew has made a shocking announcement: since he has done a flawless job of ruling us and anticipating Her Imperial Majesty's wishes, a change of title is in order. Instead of being merely Governor-General, he shall be the Prophet of the Nightmare, and his words shall carry the same weight as those of the Empress. Evening assures us that the Empress will gladly accept this unprecedented power grab."
 EQC_NLR_spread_the_darkness:0 "Spread the Darkness"
 EQC_NLR_spread_the_darkness_desc:0 "Just beyond our borders lies the greatest threat equinity has ever faced: the griffon states. Wingbardy in particular has grown fat off the sweat of its pony population, and its foremost goal is the annexation of New Mareland. We must strike first, before they can gather their strength, and spread the Nightmare out into Griffonia. Karthin will make a fine present for the Empress."
 EQC_NLR_united_lunar_territories_of_griffonia:0 "The United Lunar Territories of Griffonia"
 EQC_NLR_united_lunar_territories_of_griffonia_desc:0 "We are taking the first steps towards an entirely new domain of the Empress, far from her rule and from the capital. And while She may not be able to exert her will here, we are able to fill her place as an extension of her authority. The United Lunar Territories of Griffonia is the culmination of that extension, acting as the newest frontier of the lands of Her Imperial Majesty."

 that_tsundere_from_eqg_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: September 13th, 978, in Sunset\n\n§YBiography§!: One could describe Sour Sweet's life as a mixture of luck and perseverance. While being born in New Mareland, Sour was sent to Canterlot on the mainland from the start of her education to give her a better chance to succeed by her parents, who were middle-class citizens in the capital. It was there that much of her personality manifested, including her bipolar state, her scathing remarks when it came to others failing, and her highly competitive nature. Returning to New Mareland with a degree in finance of all things, she set out with a grim determination to get the only thing she knew she wanted; success.\n\nIt did not come easy, especially when Black Wednesday hit New Mareland and her growing business threatened to crumble. But Sour Sweet hung on and became perhaps the most, if not inspirational than unconditional success story of the period. As the threats coming from Griffonia only grew more worrisome, so too did her stake and control of arms manufacturers, until the fateful day came for her to join the Shadowbolt Society. The same qualities that she gained in Canterlot served her again here, as she became the quickest elected chairmare in the Society's history.\n\nHowever, things have gone very different from what she expected. Nightmare Moon has returned, and now she has entrusted Sour Sweet and the Society to lead New Mareland. Sour may personally have no great sympathy or devotion to the Night, but she knows that remaining a loyal colony of the Empire is ultimately beneficial for all parties. And while the Society may be split between old and new, Sour does her best to keep it united, especially in these new strange times.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
 EQC_NLR_SUNNY_FLARE_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: July 4th, 975, in New Manehattan\n\n§YBiography§!: Born to a family of the rich and influential in New Mareland, many knew that Sunny Flare was destined for greatness from the very beginning. She possessed a natural ability to fit in with the ponies she called her peers, acting with a poised, elegant and self-confident manner, and unlike many of her caliber was extremely competent in having a ruthless social streak. After graduating from university with a degree in economics, Sunny turned her attention to the defining success in her life; her father's business in the household items such as toasters and televisions, the new inventions coming from Equestria.\n\nAfter buying out all the competition and establishing a stranglehold over her part of the market, Sunny's opportunities began to dwindle. But when one door closes, another opens, and the Shadowbolt Society was her gateway to further success. In fact, Sunny Flare was the first of the "new" Shadowbolts to join, and would have likely become Chairmare had Sour Sweet not come and been voted into the position first.\n\nNow that the Nightmare has returned and New Mareland has expanded further into Griffonia, the management of Francistria, now known as Piumont has fallen to Sunny Flare. Though very different from the kind of leadership she is used to, Sunny simply sees this as yet another obstacle in her life to overcome; just another victory in the story of success that is her life.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
 EQC_NLR_INDIGO_ZAP_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: March 23rd, 982, in Stratusburg\n\n§YBiography§!: An immigrant from Equestria, Indigo Zap had a dream many pegasi had as a filly; to join the Wonderbolts. Fiercely competitive and with a drive to win that few other ponies possessed, she soared both figuratively and literally through her childhood, and many who saw her agreed that the honored position among Equestria's elite fliers was just in reach for her. There was no contest she did not win, no trophy not on her wall.\n\nBut, right as she was on the edge of joining the Wonderbolts, something changed. With no explanation, she packed her things and moved to Equestria's colony in New Mareland, almost immediately being a prime asset in the Air Force. Indigo piloted a fighter plane with the same precision and skill as she flew, but rejected the life of an active ace for being a teacher for other ponies to follow. She expected nothing less from perfection from those under her, and not many met her expectations. Those that did, however, became the best of the best in New Mareland's aerial military. Unlike many, she actively sought out the Shadowbolt Society, and became their one major asset in the armed forces.\n\nHer loyalty and her fiercely competitive nature granted her leadership of the Territory of Talouse, one split by mountains and close to the home country. Like everything, Indigo Zap sees her management of the country as a semi-friendly competition among her fellow society members, and utilizes many of her connections in the New Mareland Air Force to keep the Territory a relatively untroubled place. This is not a contest she intends to lose.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
 EQC_NLR_SUGARCOAT_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: December 29th, 973, in Fillydelphia\n\n§YBiography§!: Sugarcoat, unlike many ponies, does not reflect their name in the slightest. Since the beginning of her education, an area of her life in which she excelled, she has been extraordinarily blunt in any subject she speaks of. Whether it be someone's faults or the simple state of current affairs, she spares no subtlety in her opinion. She graduated at the top of her class with a degree in political science, but found afterwards that her cynicism had little place in the friendly and generally positive society of Equestria. So instead, she moved to New Mareland to seek a new life there instead.\n\nHer unique talents were put to good use in the highest echelons of the government, acting as an unofficial party whip and keeping anything and anypony in line. That quickly caught the attention of the Shadowbolt Society, who invited her in as yet another member to expand their wide influence. Contrary to even more expectations, Sugarcoat did not remain quiet in the Society, being one of the most vocal parts of the "new" Shadowbolts to the dismay of the more radical elements within it.\n\nNow her skills have been put to a use once again, being sent to manage the Territory of Sicameon and keep it in line with the Society's aims. Widely regarded as a difficult task between the many mountains and the dense jungles, the popular opinion back in New Mareland remains that only she has the ability to keep a solid grip on the country from the partisans that plague it. There will be nothing spared from her critical eye, no problem left while she remains. For Sugarcoat approaches this daunting place with the same approach as ever; cold calculation, intellectual cynicism, and her famous blunt attitude.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"
 EQS_NLR_LEMON_ZEST_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: April 17th, 985, in Hoovesplain\n\n§YBiography§!: If you were to ask a pony in New Mareland what famous national figure they liked the most, chances are they would say Lemon Zest. A socialite from her fillyhood, Lemon had an affinity for connecting with other ponies, whether it be though a regular conversation, a simple favor, or especially a party. She knew the right things to say to the right people, and soon everypony from the high society to the most destitute workers knew her name. Officially in her education she gained a degree in electrical engineering, but little came of it as she lived and thrived on her popularity and influence in the country. Even the local griffons enjoyed her company, as due to being born on the border with Wingbardy she understood their culture and way of life better than most other ponies.\n\nLemon Zest did not join the Shadowbolt Society out of any personal gain. She accepted their rare offer simply because she had gained a curious friendship with a few other members, those that would become the Shadow Five in the Society. She saw membership as more a hobby than anything, continuing her normal life as a influencer and party pony while simultaneously doing whatever the Shadowbolts asked of her. She was a reliable, if not special asset in the public relations part of the Society's goals.\n\nThe administration of Falcor was given to Lemon Zest purely because it would be seen as a relatively easy assignment, and because she asked to be given leadership of a Territory. The most radical of the "New" Shadowbolts, she maintains a light hoof over the griffon population when possible and prefers a more easygoing and social approach compared to her more serious friends. They may have joined for the money, but she joined for the fun, and just because she's a leader now doesn't mean she's going to stop having it.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"

 ### EVENTS ###
 EQC_NLR.1.t:0 "The Sunset Question"
 EQC_NLR.1.d:0 "We have secured the country at large and the time has come to wipe our territory clean of any vile Celestial titles. Where better to start with than our capital of course! Shall the capital's administration make ready to re-title itself to the proud city of Midnight?"
 EQC_NLR.1.a:0 "May we begin the course of annihilating any traces of the oppressive sun!"
 EQC_NLR.1.b:0 "Keeping the old name is a permanent reminder of our victory."
 
 EQC_NLR.2.t:0 "Refugees Arrive To New Mareland"
 EQC_NLR.2.d:0 "The ship lies heavy in the water as it steams into the harbor of [Root.Capital.GetName]. Marked by bullet holes and chips in its paint, the M/S Sea Spray has seen better days. Yet today she is on her most important mission. Aboard are more than 1,500 ponies, refugees from the War. They come from every walk of life: young and old, unicorn, earth pony and pegasi. They are all seeking a new life, far away from the devastating war that has ravaged their homes.\n\nThe ship docks. One by one, they disembark, carrying their possession in old bags or worn sacks. Each bears a scar from the war, either on their body or in their psyche. With desperate eyes, they look out at the city before them.\n\nSuddenly there is a new expression on their faces: Hope. They have brought with them hope for a new life, one free of hardship and war. And that's exactly what New Mareland can provide. Our country has always been a land of opportunity where anyone can achieve success and make a fortune for themselves and their family. Many of them will plant roots here, and give back to New Mareland with the fruits of their labour. With every wayward creature we take in, our nation grows stronger."
 EQC_NLR.2.a:0 "Welcome to your new home!"
 
 EQC_NLR.3.t:0 "The Direction of our Society"
 EQC_NLR.3.d:0 ""Oh, enough with the fanaticism already!" Sunny Flare slammed her hooves on the long rectangular table, standing on her hind legs. "We've handled things just fine here without listening to your talk about "praising the Empress" and we don't need to change that!"\n\nThe Shadowbolt opposite from her folded his hooves. "That sounds like heretical talk to me," he warned, leaning forward. "Do not forget who's mercy allowed us to take charge in the first place, Miss Flare."\n\nSour Sweet watched the arguments continue to unfold from her place at the head of the table. To her left where the new guard, the rich and influential ponies like Lemon Zest and Indigo Zap, who she had made personal friends with while collaborating on her... earlier business schemes. To her right were the old guard, the true Lunarists among the Shadowbolts which even included a few thestrals, who were descended from the very first society long ago. Not Sour's personal favorites, but there were still highly respected in the society and their opinions held a lot of weight. And right now, the Shadowbolts were very split down the middle.\n\n"This Society was formed to serve the Empress when she returned, not for you to make money!" a thestral of the old guard exclaimed, pointing a hoof at Sunny Flare. "The mere idea of using her blessing for personal profit is absurd!"\n\n"Praising the moon isn't what kept the society alive to the modern era either," Sugarcoat replied bluntly, looking bored through her glasses.\n\nThe arguing only continued to get louder and louder until Sour Sweet couldn't take it anymore. "Quiet!" she yelled, and the table immediately fell silent. "I am tired of you all acting like petty foals! We are going to sit down and solve this like adults!"\n\nThe Shadowbolts all looked at each other before turning to Sour again. "How about you decide then, Chairpony? What outlook should our society take?"\n\nSour Sweet took a deep breath before first looking at her friends, and then the hardline Lunarists. "It's quite obvious. The Shadowbolt Society...""
 EQC_NLR.3.a:0 ""...does not need to change. We will rule as we always have.""
 EQC_NLR.3.b:0 ""...are Lunarists first and foremost. Serving the Empress is our primary goal.""
 
 EQC_NLR.4.t:0 "A Friendlier Shadowbolt Society"
 EQC_NLR.4.d:0 "Sour Sweet adjusted her bowtie and fixed her collar one last time as she looked at the three colleagues surrounding her. "I look fine, right?" she asked all of them. "Nothing out of place? Is my ponytail crooked?"\n\n"Sour, you look fine," Sunny Flare answered, putting a hoof on her shoulder. "Besides, it's just one journalist coming for a visit!"\n\n"It is not just one journalist! This is the first time we've opened up to the public in decades! If we're going to dispel all the rumors about us going around recently, we have to get this right!"\n\nSugarcoat looked up at Sour. "Well snapping like that is definitely not going to help us look better."\n\nShe just rolled her eyes in response before taking a deep breath. After counting to three, she looked at each of her friends; Sunny, Sugarcoat and Lemon Zest in that order. "Remember, don't mention anything about your normal schemes. We can talk regular business, or whatever, but lay off the secrecy."\n\nThey all nodded right as the door opened and a sharply dressed unicorn walked into the room. Sour Sweet moved to greet her. "Hi! I'm Sour Sweet, and welcome to the Shadowbolt Society! We're sure you'll have a great time here attending one of our monthly meetings. Here, have a seat...""
 EQC_NLR.4.a:0 "See! They're not evil!"
 
 EQC_NLR.5.t:0 "The Birth Of Mareland"
 EQC_NLR.5.d:0 ""What do I look like, a screenwriter?!" Sour Sweet forcibly handed the papers in her hoof back to the intern. "Ask somepony who knows about the script, not me!"\n\nAs the intern scurried away, Sour saw Sugarcoat raise an eyebrow. But it wasn't at her. Turning, she saw a few more Shadowbolts approaching, the old guard. Internally sighing, she moved to greet them.\n\n"So, what can I do for you gentleponies today?" she asked, trying to keep things as professional as possible. The sooner these ponies were out of her mane, the better.\n\nThe other Shadowbolts looked at each other. "Well, Chairpony, we have heard of your idea for this new "movie", and we believe that it is an excellent idea. However, looking at the script, it could use a few... alterations."\n\nGreat. Absolutely wonderful. If Sour could have done so professionally, she would have facehoofed. "What kind of alterations?"\n\n"Oh, just a few things here and there. After all, we need to make sure the populace is informed of the threat the griffons pose to our society as a whole, yes?"\n\nBoth Sour Sweet and Sugarcoat blinked. The latter spoke first. "So you want us to take a film meant for showcasing our rule in a positive light and turn it into anti-griffon propaganda. That is going to do absolutely nothing for us. We are trying to show ponies that things are safe, not dangerous."\n\nThey all scoffed at that. "You think that the griffons will just let us remain here for free? They will come eventually to destroy us, and if everypony does not know that beforehoof then they will succeed. This is no time for games, Miss Sugarcoat."\n\nThe two devolved into another argument as Sour just watched from the sidelines. As Chairpony and technical producer, she did have complete control over what outlook the movie would take. And while she agreed with Sugarcoat, that wasn't to say that the old Shadowbolts didn't have a point on the threat the griffons might pose..."
 EQC_NLR.5.a:0 "We need to calm the ponies, not rile them up further."
 EQC_NLR.5.b:0 "Warn them all of the avian menace, while we still have the chance!"
 
 EQC_NLR.6.t:0 "The Protocols Of The Elders of Griffonstone"
 EQC_NLR.6.d:0 "PROTOCOL NO.1\n\nRIGHT IN MIGHT, FREEDOM IN IDEA ONLY\n\nWhat we are about to set forth, is that our system, from two points of views. That of ourselves, and that of the dweebs. It must be noted that the ponies with bad instincts, those that seek to destroy us are greater in number than the good, and that therefore, we obtain the best results in governing them through the principles of violence and destruction. Every creature aims at power, and everyone would like to become a dictator with supreme power if they could. Rare indeed are those that sacrifice their own welfare for others welfare.\n\nRarer still are those who do not cow when threatened with violence or death.\n\nFor equality of the creatures is an idea, but it is not a fact. The idea, one must know how to apply whenever it appears necessary with this bait to attract the unwashed, low-information masses.\n\nThis is rendered easier, if the opponent in question is already tainted with the idea of "Equal Protection" and for the sake of that idea, is willing to yield some of their power. It is precisely here that the triumph of our theory appears. The slackened reins of a government are immediately, by the law of life, picked up and gathered by a new, firm claw."
 EQC_NLR.6.a:0 "All of Ponykind will finally see the truth!"
 
 EQC_NLR.7.t:0 "In With The Old"
 EQC_NLR.7.d:0 "As the new recruits stood before the altar in the Temple, each wearing the brooch of a new initiate in the Shadowbolts, Sour Sweet watched from a dark corner in the room.\n\nThe Grandmaster, the direct descendant of the original founder of the Shadowbolt Society, came down from the stairs leading up to the sanctums. A unicorn, dressed in an ornate robe, with gold and silver filigrees running along the deep blue fabric. A ceremonial sword, in blueish metal with a massive sapphire in the middle hung by his side as he made his way over towards the recruits. Sour watched as the members gathered around them began chanting, the recruits one by one kneeling before the Grandmaster.\n\nThey began reciting the oath as the sword lightly touched them in order, held up by the grandmaster's magic. "I solemnly swear, that I will follow the Empress of the Night wherever she commands. Through the depth of Tartarus and to the icy North. I swear that I will not reveal the secrets of the Shadowbolt Society, even on pain of Tartarus itself. I will not break my oath, even if I must go to the grave and to eternal damnation for keeping it."\n\nAs they rose, Sour rolled her eyes. It was all too official, too traditional for her tastes. She felt like they were sliding back in time, back to a dark age of religious fevor over reasoned thought. But in the end, it wasn't her call to make.\n\nShe had lost control over her own society. The Shadowbolts she and her friends had known was gone, replaced only with ponies loyal to the Empress and the Nightmare alone."
 EQC_NLR.7.a:0 "The Shadowbolts are the Nightmare's spearhead!"
 
 EQC_NLR.8.t:0 "The Fourth Branch of Government"
 EQC_NLR.8.d:0 ""This has gone too far this time!" Strong Word said as he put a hoof on the glass table. "You and the judicial system have done nothing but try and interfere in our legislative process, advancing your own agenda. Well, we've had enough of it!"\n\n"Us?" Tight Scale scoffed. "You are the ones always involving yourselves in our justice system! We are only trying to protect the independence of our branch of the government that you are trying to steal!"\n\n"And you are not trying to steal ours? Please, all you care about is getting power for yourself. New Mareland's democratic system will not be torn apart from you and your friends' power fantasies!"\n\n"Both of you are wrong."\n\nThe two ponies looked across the room to see a third enter, impeccably dressed in her Shadowbolt uniform and glasses. "M-miss Sugarcoat," Word stammered, "we didn't notice you come in. How much did you hear?"\n\n"Everything." She walked over to where the two were sitting, staring them both down. "If you were actually trying to control each other, the Shadowbolts would have known a long time ago. All you two do instead is argue like foals. If you want to have it settled, you can always come to us to meditate your disagreement." Her stare hardened. "Do you want us to do that?"\n\nBoth of them looked at each other. "No no, Miss Sugarcoat, that's fine," Tight Scale answered, sweat starting to form. "It was just a minor argument like you said, that's all."\n\nSilence. "Good," she finally responded. Then, without another word, she walked away, hooves tapping on the hard floor. Only when the door closed behind her did the two politicans breathe a sigh of relief."
 EQC_NLR.8.a:0 "Any arguments will be settled by us... our way."
 
 EQC_NLR.9.t:0 "The Picket-Dew Line"
 EQC_NLR.9.d:0 "The posters appeared one by one in the cities, and in the countryside soon after. Some depict scenes of graphic violence: a dead pony in the claws of a griffon, or a griffon knight slashing through a pony soldier. Others depict insatiable greed: griffon gangsters committing armed robbery, or a fat merchant from Skyfall swindling honest ponies.\n\nThey all share one element in common, other than being anti-griffon. At the bottom of each poster is a slogan, usually something like "STOP THE GRIFFON MENACE" or "BOYCOTT GRIFFON-MADE PRODUCTS." Beside each slogan are the signatures of Picket Fence, Governor of New Hoofington, and Evening Dew, the Governor-General. No matter whose idea they were, the posters seem to be hitting the right cords.\n\nPonies across New Mareland are holding demonstrations in support of the campaign and the new laws targeting griffon communitites. In rural areas, griffons must now present a pass to travel between towns, and many municipalities plan to bar griffons from becoming permanent residents. In the cities, major pressure has been put on factory owners to fire their griffon workers and hire ponies instead. Restaurants that cater to griffon customers have been the targets of boycotts and, occasionally, violent attacks.\n\nMany were surprised to learn that Picket Fence, who was previously a member of the New Mareland Republican Fascist Party, is working with Evening Dew, a devout Lunarist. When asked for comment, Governor Fence stated that his beliefs have not changed, but he is happy to work with the Governor-General to "solve the griffon problem.""
 EQC_NLR.9.a:0 "For an Equine New Mareland!"
 
 EQC_NLR.10.t:0 "The Radio Broadcast"
 EQC_NLR.10.d:0 "Evening Dew cleared his throat as he approached the microphone. He wore a smug smile, confident in the truth of what he was about to say.\n\n"Ponies of New Mareland! We are, at this moment, facing a serious crisis. Beyond our borders, beyond the last vestiges of equine civilization lies an existential threat. The griffons present themselves to the world as a collection of independent, sovereign nations. They claim that, through hard work and honest means, they will rise to become the envy of both pony and zebra.\n\nBut we know the truth. Just as a snake cannot defy its instincts, the griffon cannot leave behind its insidious nature. They are depraved, barbaric creatures. Treachery and murder come naturally to them, as they are inherently violent. They feast on the corpses of their enemies, tearing them apart without a care for morality.\n\nSome insist on calling griffons our fellow creatures, but I prefer to call them what they really are: demons, demons from the depths of Tartarus itself!\n\nContrast them with us, the equines. We are a physically weaker species, but we have the aegis of the Empress to protect us. And we do not fear adversity. When the griffons failed to tame the hard soil of New Mareland, we rose to the challenge. Now we must rise to defend ourselves, our land, and our faith!\n\nWe may be small, and we may be few, but we are stronger together, and we serve an Empress who will lead us towards a better future. As Her Imperial Majesty's representative, it is my duty to lead you on her behalf.\n\nAnd we will need strong leadership. Though the griffons are presently fighting amongst themselves, they will not stay amongst themselves forever. When they turn outwards these griffons, these demons from Tartarus will come here!\n\nWe must be ready for them. We need to prepare ourselves for their attack. When they come, we will meet them with all the might and power of equinity and save our land!""
 EQC_NLR.10.a:0 "We must defeat these demons!"
 
 EQC_NLR.11.t:0 "The End of New Mareland?"
 EQC_NLR.11.d:0 "Now that the old administration has been removed and a new one loyal to the Empress has taken its place, there have been controversial rumors floating around about a new proposal concerning the country. All ponies know of the thestral's status as the favored tribe of the moon, and the one which supports Her Majesty the most in her rule of the Lunar Empire. To reflect that status, some wish for the country to officially rename itself to Thestralia, a home for all batponies. While not very popular with our non-batpony citizens, it would certainly endear us to the thestrals living here and perhaps draw more from the mainland. Though of course, the old name of New Mareland has been with us for centuries. What shall it be?"
 EQC_NLR.11.a:0 "G'day mate! Welcome to Thestralia! Business or pleasure?"
 EQC_NLR.11.b:0 "We will stick with our heritage, and remain New Mareland."
 
 EQC_NLR.12.t:0 "New Blood"
 EQC_NLR.12.d:0 ""The last time we met like this, I believe you told me that if I declined your offer to join, I would not get another chance," Jet Set commented as he raised an eyebrow at Sour Sweet across the table.\n\nSour was tempted to stomp the floor in frustration but restrained herself, instead forcing a smile at both Jet Set and Upper Crust. "Yes, I do remember saying that. However, considering how important you still are to the ponies of New Mareland, I decided to make an exception."\n\nUpper Crust scoffed at that. "Hmph. If I had it my way, we never would have come to this meeting in the first place. Our loyalties remain with Harmony, no matter what."\n\n"Personally, I don't care where your loyalties lie in our society," Sour replied. "What I care about is what you can offer the Society, and what the Society can offer you."\n\n"...Continue."\n\nSour Sweet leaned in towards Jet Set, crossing her hooves on the table. "Ponies know you, Jet Set. And more importantly, they trust you. Your successful business sense would have already made you a candidate for induction, but those two things together? You would make a valuable addition to our little group. And as for us..." She gestured to the room around them. "Our resources would be at your disposal. You help us, we help you. So, what do you say?" She outstretched her hoof towards him. "Will you accept our invitation?"\n\nJet Set and Upper Crust looked at each other for a moment before facing back and nodding once. Then, after shaking hooves once, Sour Sweet gave them their Shadowbolts pins as the newest members of the Society."
 EQC_NLR.12.a:0 "Welcome to the club!"
 
 EQC_NLR.13.t:0 "Small Business"
 EQC_NLR.13.d:0 "Soft Spot put the broom back in the closet and closed the door before letting out a content sigh and sitting on a nearby chair. Only months ago had the idea of her starting her own business seemed absurd, what with her being a family mare and her husband paying the bills working at the nearby steelworks. And yet, here she was, running her own little pastry shop in downtown New Manehattan. It was even running fairly successfully; she was turning a nice profit from all the new government subsidies and bonuses, which was what had gotten her to give her idea a shot in the first place...\n\nThe bell by the door rang, and Soft Spot looked up, only to have her jaw drop to the floor. Trotting in was none other than one of the most popular ponies in all of New Mareland, Lemon Zest. She looked around the shop in her dress uniform, the Shadowbolts Society pin clear on her collar. "Anypony here?" she asked out loud.\n\nSoft practically tripped over herself rushing to the counter. "I'm here, I'm here!" she said hurriedly. "What can I get you, Miss Zest?"\n\nThe Shadowbolt waved a hoof. "Call me Lemon. I'll need a dozen cupcakes for the upcoming Society meeting. I was supposed to bring the food this time, and I totally forgot until right now!"\n\n"Of course, Mis- I mean Lemon." Composing herself, Soft Spot walked to where she kept the day's pastries, looking for the best kind of cupcakes to give her. "It's really an honor to meet you," she said as she pulled out a packaged dozen cupcakes and brought them over to the register. "I mean, I really should be thanking you and all, with how your new small business bonuses helped me open this place."\n\n"I know, it's crazy right? Never would have guessed that Sour and Sunny of all ponies would have thought of something like that up. They had some long economic talk on why it was good and all but I totally slept through the whole thing."\n\nAfter putting some bits on the counter, Lemon grabbed the cupcakes with a hoof and started trotting out the door. "Thanks, you're a lifesaver!"\n\n"You're welcome," Soft Spot replied as the mare walked back into the open streets of New Manehattan. She sighed again. Perhaps the Shadowbolts weren't as bad as she first thought."
 EQC_NLR.13.a:0 "It's a win for everypony!"
 
 EQC_NLR.14.t:0 "United Shadow Works"
 EQC_NLR.14.d:0 ""Just because your corporation was the largest when we formed the USW doesn't mean that you get to tell us what to do!"\n\nSour Sweet gave a huff while she rolled her eyes. Ever since the idea was proposed to merge all the Shadowbolt-controlled corporations into one entity, the United Shadow Works, it had been nothing but trouble for her. First she had to get all the Society members to agree to it, which was a pain in and of itself. Then had come the issue of who would manage what, where everypony involved had tried to get as much authority over the company as possible. Once a compromise had been reached on forming an executive Shadowbolt council to oversee the entity, it had seemed that everypony had left satisfied.\n\nThat is, until today's issue of funding had come up.\n\n"Oh yes, because your company was performing so much better than mine was," Sour replied in a saccharine tone. "If you're using failures as a statistic. I'm just trying to divide funding according to common sense, and if my part of the corporation is making the most profit, then it needs the most funding to maintain that!"\n\n"And who put you in charge of the funding in the first place, Sour?" The rest of the Shadowbolts present murmured their agreement with Sunny Flare as she crossed her hooves.\n\n"Yeah, just because you're the Chairpony doesn't mean you get to call all the shots!" another council member from the back said.\n\nAnd it was at that very moment that Sour Sweet was ready to bang her head against the table. This meeting was going to take a while."
 EQC_NLR.14.a:0 "Why can't we go back to how things used to be?"
 
 EQC_NLR.15.t:0 "The New Workforce"
 EQC_NLR.15.d:0 "When the motion was first passed by the Shadowbolts to start leasing convicts as labor, nothing seemed to change. In fact, things seemed to just go on as normal as the labor issue in the country was finally solved. Profits went up higher than ever before with lower required wages, the officially imprisoned population in New Mareland went down, and overall the program was relatively successful. Ever Sugarcoat, who had been against it originally couldn't argue with its results.\n\nYet behind closed doors, not everything was running smoothly. What had seemed like a simple new law from the outside had been heavily debated and fought from the inside, within the Society. Sour Sweet and Sunny Flare had been neutral, but the rest of their group had argued endlessly with the old Shadowbolts on convict labor. Lemon Zest had even walked out of the meeting, citing her public image and general feeling that this was the wrong thing for New Mareland to do. Sour had only seen her a few times since then, and she could tell the mare was still angry over what they had done.\n\nWas she right? Sour didn't know what to think of it herself. She had joined and led the Shadowbolt Society in the first place for simple reasons; to make money and have a stronger voice in New Mareland's politics. She had made friends too, sure, but her original intention had never changed. And on paper, using convicts was something towards that goal. She made more money alongside everypony else, and she was still the Chairpony of the Shadowbolts, even if those friends were having a few disagreements.\n\nSo, why did she feel that they were going too far with this?"
 EQC_NLR.15.a:0 "Who cares about the convicts anyway?"
 
 EQC_NLR.16.t:0 "A Meeting of Colleagues"
 EQC_NLR.16.d:0 "Officially, it was a party invite sent out to all members and branches of the Shadowbolt Society. Held in the most opulent palace in [Root.Capital.GetName], countless Shadowbolts mingled at the event, chatting and dancing the night away. Suri Polomare was showing off her latest dress design to a few ponies from the Falcor branch, and even Jet Set seemed to be enjoying himself speaking with old friends.\n\nHowever, as with many things in the Society, there was more to one purpose for this gathering. In a room far above the main event, five ponies had gathered in their own meeting overlooking the party. Lemon Zest had finally conceded to Sugarcoat for once and allowed classical music to be played on record in the background while the friends enjoyed their champagne.\n\n"You know," Sour Sweet said, "I remember back when all of us first joined the Shadowbolt Society. We all hated each other back then, right?"\n\n"Yeah, because Lemon Zest wouldn't take anything seriously," Sugarcoat responded.\n\nLemon spewed the champagne in her mouth, much to Sunny Flare's displeasure. "What?! It was because you were so serious all the time! All you ever did was tell me to pay attention to boring stuff, or that I was doing things wrong!"\n\n"Well, it seems some things never changed," Sunny commented, causing a round of laughter from the three girls watching the argument. Sugarcoat rolled her eyes and adjusted her glasses while Lemon glared.\n\nSour Sweet shut down the argument by clearing her throat loudly and walking between the two. "What I was trying to point out was how far we've come since then. We've gone from an underground society for manipulating economics to leaders of entire nations in the world. Everypony in this room has their own branch of the Shadowbolts."\n\nThe other four gathered on both sides of Sour Sweet, forming a semi-circle. "We couldn't have done it without you, Sour!" Lemon Zest said, her mood having clearly returned. "You've been the best leader and Chairpony we could ask for!"\n\n"You did do better than I thought you would," Sugarcoat agreed.\n\n"We're all lucky to have you," Sunny Flare added, putting a hoof on her shoulder.\n\n"And soon, I'm sure we'll be calling the shots on the whole planet!" Indigo Zap finished.\n\nSour Sweet looked at each of them one by one before her eyes turned to the window in front of them, looking down at all the Shadowbolt members below. "I may not know what the future holds for the Society," she remarked with a genuine smile forming on her face, "but I know that with you girls as my colleag- no, my friends, we can win at anything.""
 EQC_NLR.16.a:0 "A toast, to the success of the Shadowbolts and its Chairpony!"
 
 EQC_NLR.17.t:0 "A Meeting of Colleagues"
 EQC_NLR.17.d:0 "It was already past midnight when the last members of the Shadowbolt Society filed into the ballroom in a palace within [Root.Capital.GetName], classical music playing from a band on the stage. Members of all four tribes danced and made small talk as they sipped their wine, coming from all across the territories of Southern Griffonia to attend. It had all the parts of any formal ball, every guest impeccably dressed in the official uniform of the Shadowbolt Society and with the small pin on the collars.\n\nYet in a small room overlooking the dance, five ponies stood together, watching the scene unfold. The absolute silence further exacerbated the somber tone, each only staring at the glass window in front of them.\n\n"Shouldn't... you be down there, Sour?" Lemon Zest asked hesitantly. "I mean, you're the Chairpony and all."\n\nSour Sweet didn't even look at her as she responded. "Am I, Lemon? It doesn't feel like it anymore."\n\n"What do you mean?" Sunny Flare leaning forward to look at Sour's face with a confused expression. "Sour, the Shadowbolt Society has never been stronger under your leadership! You received a personal letter of commendation from the Empress herself! How could you think you're not our Chairpony?"\n\nThe pony refused to meet Sunny's eyes. "I never wanted to lead for any of that," she finally answered, keeping her eyes trained on the party below. "I wanted the power, I'll admit it. But there was something else, something that I think united all of us in the Society to become friends. But I haven't felt that thing for a long time now."\n\nThe other Shadowbolts looked at each other before they turned their attention to Sour Sweet again. Despite the absurdity of it, her words were true, for all of them. They had each joined the Society for a purpose, and each had enjoyed meeting and working with each other, back before the Nightmare's return. Now though, even with everything they had done... there was nothing left for them. No enjoyment, no fun.\n\nSour Sweet put a hoof on the window panel and stared at her reflection, looking right back at her. "We got what we wanted, didn't we? We served the Empress, we control all of southern Griffonia. We're some of the most influential mares in the world now. By every account, we won."\n\n"So... why doesn't it feel that way?""
 EQC_NLR.17.a:0 "We got success, but for what?"
 
 EQC_NLR.18.t:0 "The Response"
 EQC_NLR.18.d:0 "When Evening Dew first declared himself the Prophet of the Nightmare, nopony in New Mareland questioned it. He was their absolute ruler serving in the Empress's name, after all, so why wouldn't he have the title? Everything he did, he did for Her Imperial Majesty, and his words were the words of the Empress.\n\nHowever, the Lunar Empire's reaction was... less positive than we expected. What little support Evening Dew had left among the radical Lunarists has all but evaporated since the proclamation, which they consider a heresy of the highest order. Yesterday the Empress herself finally took a stance on the matter, calling Evening Dew's actions "treasonous." She has officially severed all ties with the colony to punish our insubordination.\n\nWhen Evening Dew heard the news, he locked himself in his room for 3 days straight, refusing to speak to anypony. After he finally emerged, he declared that Her Imperial Majesty is merely testing his faith and devotion, and said our exclusion from the Empire will end soon.\n\nMost New Marelanders aren't buying this story. Day by day, they are realizing how precarious our situation has become. We now find ourselves devoid of the Empress's protection, and vulnerable to griffon aggression.\n\nWe are alone."
 EQC_NLR.18.a:0 "What is a Prophet without his deity?"
 
 EQC_NLR.19.t:0 "Loyalty"
 EQC_NLR.19.d:0 ""I must admit, Governor-General, you have far exceeded my expectations in your tenure. It is not often that such a pony rises so far above his post, especially one so... lacking in devotion."\n\nJet Set dipped his head towards the Empress in respect. "Thank you, your Majesty. It is my honor to have served you with such success."\n\nNightmare Moon regally walked across the room to the window, where the capital of New Mareland spread out before the shining moonlight. "Be honest, Governor. What do you think of my rule?" Her slit eye traced the unicorn as he carefully chose his next words.\n\n"Your reign has brought nothing but prosperity to New Mareland," Jet Set said calmly. "Under your guidance, we have established control over all of Southern Griffonia, and the ponies in the nation have never-"\n\n"I am not speaking of your success, Governor." The alicorn turned to face him again. "I know you have contacts within the Empire. Celestial sympathizers, most likely. I want your personal opinion on my reign."\n\nNightmare Moon stared Jet Set down, but not once did he falter. He was too trained, too experienced for a mistake like that. His eyes did not once leave Hers as he spoke steadily.\n\n"When I was sent to New Mareland, I was loyal to one thing; the Princess. Then, I became loyal to New Mareland. Now, I am loyal to both it, and Equestria itself. And as long as the New Mareland people remain loyal to you, I shall as well."\n\nThe Nightmare did not speak for a few moments. Then, She turned away, slowly walking towards the open door. "I can see why my sister chose you." she said, not looking back. "The Empire and I thank you for your continued service, Governor-General. You may return to your duties."\n\nThe doors closed behind Nightmare Moon, leaving Jet Set alone."
 EQC_NLR.19.a:0 "'Keep Calm and Carry On', as we always have."
 
 EQC_NLR.20.t:0 "A Prophet Without Honor"
 EQC_NLR.20.d:0 "Nightmare Moon stood alone, smiling. A pleasant aura emanated from her figure. Evening Dew approached, shaking with every step.\n"You have done well, my prophet."\nEvening felt tears form in his eyes. It was all he ever want-\n"Goveror-General! Can you hear me?"\n\nThe gruff stallion's voice jolted Evening back to reality. He found himself seated at a wooden table. He and a few advisors were meeting with an old general. Evening stretched his wings and ran a hoof over his messy mane. He felt the bags under his bloodshot eyes. Frowning, he grabbed a pot of coffee and took a sip.\n"Yes, General, I can hear you! I ignored you because I was contemplating Her Imperial Majesty's will. Now please, say your piece, and remember to address me as Prophet of the Nightmare."\n\nThe general looked flustered. "Yes, Prophet. I asked you here to discuss our strategic situation. Griffon resistance to our rule is increasing. It's become a full-scale insurgency."\nEvening snarled. "Vile Barbarians. Demons from Tartarus, all of them!"\n"Yes, well, be that as it may, our forces are spread very thin. Supplies are running low, and I fear our industry won't be able to keep up with demand. We can't trade with griffon states, and since the Empress disavowed you it's been hard to get shipments from Equus..."\n\nThe terror in the faces of Evening's advisors made the general realize he'd crossed a line. Evening's eye twitched, and then he smiled.\n"Disavowed, you say? Nonsense! Her Imperial Majesty has simply seen fit to test my faith. Any day now she will announce that I have passed and welcome me back into her fold. Any day now..."\n\nEvening's face contorted with frustration. He squeezed the coffee pot between his hooves, until suddenly it shattered. Screams erupted from his mouth as hot coffee splashed him.\n\nFor a moment everyone was silent. The only audible sound was blood dripping from the cuts on Evening's hooves.\n"Well General, your presentation was most enlightening. I think you will understand the situation better if you see it from a... different perspective. I'm demoting you to private and sending you into the field, effective immediately."\n\nThe old stallion shivered. "I don't think I'm suited for-"\n"Really Private, I insist!" Evening said, venom in his voice. With a wave, he signaled his guards to take the former general away."
 EQC_NLR.20.a:0 "The nightmare has only just begun."
 
 EQC_NLR.21.t:0 "The Madness of Evening Dew"
 EQC_NLR.21.d:0 "When we appointed Evening Dew to the position of Governor-General of New Mareland, we assumed that his loyalty was unquestionable. After all, he was chosen specifically because of his intense devotion to our Empress. His devotion was so impressive that it seemed to offset his complete lack of any other qualifications.\n\nHowever, disturbing news has reached us from [EQC.Capital.GetName]. While we acknowledge that Evening has done an adequate job of running the colony, he insists that his performance has been perfect in every way. He claims this is because of his "unique ability to interpret Her Imperial Majesty's will," and says that his words should now carry the same weight as those of the Empress herself. He has confirmed this unbelievable declaration by giving himself a new title: the Prophet of the Nightmare.\n\nIn other words, Evening Dew has directly challenged the authority of our Empress.\n\nReactions from across the Empire have been universally negative. Many radical Lunarists, some of them Evening's former friends, are now accusing him of being a crypto-Solarist. The Empress has publicly called Evening a traitor and demanded that he resign and surrender himself immediately. Many others are simply baffled by the fact that this inexplicable, heretical declaration came from a thestral once considered so reliable. The leading theory is that Evening must have completely lost his mind.\n\nFormulating a response to Evening's declaration has proven difficult. While the ideal solution would be to remove him from office, that is now beyond our power. Evening's grip on the colony has become all but absolute, and our authority there is waning fast. After several heated deliberations, the government has decided to officially sever all ties with the colony. The question of whether or not to invade New Mareland and forcibly remove Evening will have to be decided later."
 EQC_NLR.21.a:0 "Evening Dew, give me back my colony!"

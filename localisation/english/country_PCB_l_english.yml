In 1003, Sandía was assassinated while in Abyssinia attempting to organise a communist uprising against the monarchy. Roca Roja became the chairman of the communist party and has since rebranded the party as the Popular Socialist Party in an attempt to win over more popular support those among the working class who disapprove of revolutionary action and still support the Princesses.\n\nRoca is often considered a coward or weak by some communists for his belief that the revolution should come peacefully rather than through revolutionary actions. This lead to a falling out with Bagasse Coltstro and his supporters."

 POLITICS_COLTSTRO_DESC:0 "Born in the town of Grano in 978 to a successful sugar cane farmer, Bagasse first became politically active while studying at the University of Puerto Caballo. He became highly critical of the government of the dictator President Quesadilla and even made the front page of several underground newspapers. This drew the attention of supporters of the dictator who began to threaten and bully him. This only drew him towards militantism.\n\nInspired by the works of Caramel Marks and Steel Stallion, he came to blame all of Puerto Caballo's problems on capitalism and the dictatorships of the bourgeoisie and that revolution was the only way to rid the island of cruelty and corruption.\n\nIn 1,004 he formed a group called the Movement and gathered fellow revolutionaries to support him. On the 13th June 1,005 he lead the group in an attack on the Royal Guard barracks in Luna de Compostela. The attack failed and he and his 122 supporters were arrested. Bagasse made a show of his trial, including a four hour speech defending his actions and denouncing the successive corruption in the Puerto Caballo government that gained him the sympathy of many ponies in the nation.\n\nHe was sentenced to 3 years in prison, but even behind bars continued his political activism."

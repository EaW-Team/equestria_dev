#LEADERS
LYSIA_DESC:0 "Trained at the prestigious Vesalipolis Military Academy, Lilac was nevertheless relegated to administrative duties working on the Queen's General Staff during the Great War against Equestria. Whilst her classmates achieved glory for the Changeling Lands on the battlefield, she was stuck in Vesalipolis kowtowing to Chrysalis.\nHer service to the Queen seemed to have paid off, though, as she was bestowed the title of Protectress over the exalted metropolis of Manehattan following its conquest.\n§YPortrait By§!: Drake Drachenlicht\n§YRedrawn By§!: Rich May"
LYSIA_GENERAL_DESC:0 "Trained at the prestigious Vesalipolis Military Academy, Lilac served on the Queen's General Staff during the Great War against Equestria. As the Protectress of Manehattan, Lilac finally has the chance to command her own army on the field in the absence of a native officer corps. Her officer's uniform may not be as glamourous as the ceremonial evening gowns befitting her rank of Protectress, but on campaign with her troops is where Lilac feels most at home.\n§YPortrait By§!: Drake Drachenlicht\n§YRedrawn By§!: Rich May"
STARTRIX_DESC:0 "When Equestria fell, Starlight Glimmer was a reformed cult leader and Trixie Lulamoon a less than scruplous travelling magician, and yet it was these talents that saw them rise to become the leaders of the Equestrian Liberation Front. Having worked since the first days of the occupation, they used misdirection, deceit and - at times - simple ruthlessness to contest the changeling occupiers. Unlike their erstwhile (and in Trixie's case, reluctant) mentor, Twilight Sparkle, they had no notions of fighting fair. Still, Equestria needs whatever heroes it can get, and if they are what is available, then that is what they must be.\nThough their friendship is a tempestuous one, it has remained steadfast, and they have learned to play off each other. Starlight Glimmer has established herself as the strategist and the planner whereas Trixie has become (in)famous as an able tactician and guerilla commander. Their unorthodox backgrounds have informed their methods, and they managed to carry their efforts this far through these tricks.\nIt takes more than just tricks to lead a rebel army, however, and beyond the trickery and creativity stands two mares who, when all other heroes seemed to have failed, saw themselves called to step up and take over the fight. If they should fail, they know that other ponies will step up as well, because that is the Equestria they remember and will fight for.\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"
ELF_BLUEBLOOD_DESC:0 "Prince Blueblood of Canterlot was born into wealth, prestige and privilege as a member of Equestria's absolute elite. Indeed, due to a judicial adoption of his ancestor a century ago, he could even be counted as a "nephew" of Celestia. This fact did not go unmentioned for long by Blueblood, whose wealth meant he could become a full time socialite and a fixture in the Canterlot social scene. Over time, as ennui sat in, his proclivities turned more sour and he began to amuse himself by tormenting the various mares who tried to approach him, dismissing them all as golddiggers, and starting various ridiculous trends to see who caught on.\nHis military career started nigh on a whim after his boredom with life became too much. Using his wealth and an archaic law to purchase a high commission, Blueblood landed as Field Marshal of Equestria within a few years, and it was only when the changeling invasion approached that the gravity of his position sunk in. Though he did what he could to prepare, especially using his connections to appoint the best people he could find to the best positions, it was not enough, and he ended up overseeing the worst defeat Equestria had suffered in centuries. He fled to Griffonia and remained there for years, studying the griffonian way of war and building up as many contacts as he could in the vain hope that Equestria would rise one day again.\nWith the rise of the ELF and his subsequent return home, he began working tirelessly to aid the cause and to wipe away his old shame. Yet, as it turned out it was after the war that his true rise would begin. Becoming a perfect foil to the more radical Starlight Glimmer and Trixie Lulamoon in the eyes of high society, he could have become their puppet to keep the old order intact, but his time in Griffonia had opened his eyes in more ways than one. When he assumed leadership, it was under his own program. Equestria should remember its traditions and customs, but he will burn before he allows the upper class to ignore the responsibilities that come with their status.\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"

MAN_republic_2_desc:0 "Manehattan has become a place of luxurious goods and attractions one simply can't find back home. We should exploit this to attract tourists, especially from the homeland's soldier class. Our goal is to have every Changeling visit Manehattan at least once!"
MAN_republic_2_a:0 "Soldier-Settler Hive-Colonies"
MAN_republic_2_a_desc:0 "Now that we have secured our regime's continued existence, we should encourage immigrants from the homeland to form settler colonies in the lands of the Federation. They will prove very useful as soldiers and as a way to shift the demographics of the region in our favour."
MAN_republic_3:0 "Live and Let Live"
MAN_republic_3_desc:0 "Changelings and ponies truly have no reason to quarrel with each other. Lady Lilac seeks to promote a policy where all citizens who perform their basic duties, changeling and pony alike, will be allowed freedom and prosperity in our realm. Soon enough, our two species will flourish alongside each other instead of in opposition to each other for the first time in history."
MAN_republic_3_a:0 "Devolve Military Power"
MAN_republic_3_a_desc:0 "The centralisation of the Ost-Kommando compromises its effectiveness and makes the ponies feel as though they're being oppressed by an all-powerful militaristic government. We should delegate power over the military to local authorities and officers, so the citizens feel more included through the representation of their areas." 
MAN_republic_finale:0 "An Ost-Equestrian Identity?"
MAN_republic_finale_desc:0 "Lilac's brainchild, the nascent Dominion of Eastern Equestria, is on the path to glory. The bureaucrats of Vesalipolis have been marginalised, Changelings flock in their thousands from their frozen homeland to our greener pastures, and the ponies finally seem to have accepted the new status quo. Lilac's next move shall surely put our nation onto the world stage. Long live the Ost-Equestrian creature!"
MAN_republic_4:0 "Army of the Dominion"
MAN_republic_4_desc:0 "With the formation of the Dominion and Federation, the Garrison of the Protectorate must be remade into a new fighting force that reflects our new national character. A series of improvements on ordnance and doctrine shall serve as the figurative advance-guard for the ascent of the Army of the East-Equestrian Dominion."
MAN_republic_4_a:0 "The Modern Panzergrenadier"
MAN_republic_4_a_desc:0 "It was the principles of mechanized blitzkrieg warfare, embodied by the halftrack-mounted Changeling Panzergrenadier, that secured the Hegemony's victory in the Great War. The soldiers of Manehattan, too, must emulate such precepts as initiative, mobility, and flexibility if we are to adapt tried-and-true military strategy to the new challenges that threaten the Dominion and Federation today."
MAN_republic_4_b:0 "Panzer, Vor!"
MAN_republic_4_b_desc:0 "It is not merely sufficient for us to imitate Changeling military doctrine; the Ost-Kommando's claim to innovativeness and unorthodoxy must be backed up by tangible action. A new era of armoured warfare is on the horizon, and we must be the first to seize upon the opportunities it promises!"
MAN_republic_4_c:0 "Cult of Speed"
MAN_republic_4_c_desc:0 "It is speed that is the core tenet of the blitzkrieg school of armoured and mechanized warfare. Through a radical synthesis of two fields of scientific research - those of the processing and refinement of Love, and the application of biomedical technology to applicable chemistry - our Changeling soldiers can soon achieve an unprecedented level of agility and adaptability on the battlefield."
MAN_republic_5:0 "Luftflotte Manehattan"
MAN_republic_5_desc:0 "In order for us to ever gain any form of autonomy from Vesalipolis, we will have to begin pulling our weight within the Hegemony. One way to do this is to hold our own in the fight in the skies, and our position on the east coast is a boon to this effort. To jumpstart our efforts, we can request an air squad of our own to support our emerging air force."
MAN_republic_5_1:0 "Raketentechnik-Division"
MAN_republic_5_1_desc:0 "Rocketry! Primitive long-range missiles were first tested during the Great War, but now, the Ost-Kommando shall pioneer the use of both ballistic and cruise missiles in warfare. It's literally rocket science, but we'll manage."
MAN_republic_5_a:0 "Bombengeschwader-Ost"
MAN_republic_5_a_desc:0 "Another step by our airforce should be the establishment of an independent bomber command. We have found a corporation that is willing to produce our bombers locally for us, and an experienced ace pilot from the war who will lead our bomber squadrons."
MAN_republic_5_b:0 "The Eastern Bulwark"
MAN_republic_5_b_desc:0 "As they grow stronger, the treacherous powers of Griffonia eye our Empire with growing suspicion. The fortification of our eastern seaboard is in order to protect the Hegemony against a seaborne invasion from the east. With time, resources, and ingenuity, we shall make Manehattan into the Changeling bulwark against Griffonia."
MAN_republic_5_c:0 "Rulers of the Stratosphere"
MAN_republic_5_c_desc:0 "Our air forces have grown in strength significantly over the past months. We need to take this a step further by procuring state of the art jets to ensure our air superiority over the highest strata of the atmosphere."
MAN_republic_5_d:0 "Exercise "White Queen""
MAN_republic_5_d_desc:0 "Manehattan's military has come a long way since the first days of the Protectorate. Now that the Ost-Kommando commands a truly capable fighting force, it is time for us to make our martial prowess known to the rest of the Hegemony - and Vesalipolis - through a massive military exercise."
MAN_republic_6:0 "Under New Management"
MAN_republic_6_desc:0 "Now that we have secured our autonomy from Vesalipolis, the Manehattan administration has direct access to the coveted resources of the inner regions of the Dominion. The Ost-Kommando is eager to exploit them to the fullest extent to develop our productive capabilities."
MAN_republic_6_a:0 "The Manehattanite Bit"
MAN_republic_6_a_desc:0 "Ever since the Protectorate was founded, Manehattan has used the Changeling currency from the homeland. But now we're a seperate entity from the rest of the Hegemony, and we must decouple our currency from Vesalipolis in order to prosper. To this end, the Manehattan bit will be used as the new currency of the Dominion as part of our attempts to liberalise the economy."
MAN_republic_6_b:0 "An Economic Miracle?"
MAN_republic_6_b_desc:0 "Manehattan's potential for growth is truly impressive, but so far the administration hasn't interfered in the economy much since the loosening of control from Vesalipolis. If we begin implementing programmes of intervention to further develop the economy, the Ost-Kommando believes Manehattan can truly achieve an economic miracle."
MAN_republic_6_c:0 "Reemploy the Boffins"
MAN_republic_6_c_desc:0 "Many of the pony scientists of Manehattan had been denied their jobs under the suspicion of disloyalty to the changeling regime, and our research capabilities have suffered. But now that our rule has consolidated and Vesalipolis can't stop us anymore, there's no reason we shouldn't seek to include these bright minds in the service of our new home."
MAN_republic_7:0 "Magitech Wonders"
MAN_republic_7_desc:0 "To build up a Manehattan-based military-industrial complex in the service of the Hegemony's war machine, the Ost-Kommando had consolidated East Equestria's industry under state-controlled corporate heavyweights such as the HoVa Corporation. The recent stabilisation of the region now allows us to engage in a more high-minded pursuit of scientific and technological prowess."
MAN_republic_7_1:0 "Coastal Receivers"
MAN_republic_7_1_desc:0 "We can never be too secure against foreign threats. To the east lie the griffons, notoriously greedy creatures who might find themselves attracted to our wealth. We need to develop radar systems across the east coast to detect potential foreign incursions early."
MAN_republic_7_a:0 "Trains Run on Time"
MAN_republic_7_a_desc:0 "Nothing aids economic growth like railways! The Ost-Kommando has decided to connect every region of the Dominion by train to transport resources and labour with greater ease. This should encourage the development of our productive capabilities faster than ever."
MAN_republic_7_b:0 "Thunder and Lightning"
MAN_republic_7_b_desc:0 "The unique talents of the three pony races are something even changelings grudgingly admire. If we combine them with the changeling penchant for creating powerful military inventions, we can surely add a host of magnificent contraptions to our military apparatus."
MAN_republic_7_c:0 "Secret Atomic Testing"
MAN_republic_7_c_desc:0 "While we cannot yet begin an official nuclear programme, the Ost-Kommando is well aware that there are forces that would seek to destroy us - and many such forces can be found back home in Vesalipolis. In order to survive in the modern world, we need a sufficient deterrent. We should commence top secret testing of nuclear weapons in the event that we'll need them someday."
MAN_republic_7_d:0 "Cities for a New Age"
MAN_republic_7_d_desc:0 "Without Manehattan, there would be no Federation. Policies to entice internal migration to our coastal cities will give us the cheap urban labour needed to pursue economic growth. Drawing away the countryside's youth and talent also means destabilising the Harmonic Resistance's power base."
MAN_extra_1:0 "Formalise the State"
MAN_extra_1_desc:0 "We are finally exiting the long transitional phase of our administration over Eastern Equestria. Lady Lilac may now proceed with formally establishing the Changeling-Equestrian Government of National Unity, through which pony and changeling alike will be represented in the Dominion's affairs."
MAN_extra_2:0 "Resurrect the Fleet"
MAN_extra_2_desc:0 "Under the Diarchy, Manehattan was home to the great warships of the Celestial Sea Fleet, which had dominated the ocean between Equus and Griffonia. The military-grade dockyards used to service the fleet are still in operation, but the goal of this initiative to resurrect a bygone fleet is mainly psychological and propagandistic - the Fleet was a symbol of Manehattanite pride, and we shall co-opt it as such."
MAN_extra_3:0 "Our New Homeland"
MAN_extra_3_desc:0 "Changeling immigration into the cities of the east coast has been only increasing since the declaration of the Dominion, and increasingly these migrants have began developing a different identity to their compatriots back home. This is their homeland now, and they are willing to fight and die for it like any true patriot would."
MAN_extra_4:0 "Revive the Guard"
MAN_extra_4_desc:0 "The pony Constabulary and our other collaborationist paramilitaries were essential to maintaining order within the Protectorate. Now, by invoking the mantle of the bygone Guards to codify the inclusion of ponies in the military, we can create a truly East-Equestrian fighting force that any citizen of the Dominion and Federation, regardless of their species, can be proud to call their own."
MAN_extra_5:0 "Welcome the Exiled"
MAN_extra_5_desc:0 "Queen Chrysalis, being the tyrant she is (hush-hush about that, though) has alienated a lot of her own officers with her domineering ways, whilst others have found themselves demoted or even exiled on suspicion of "disloyalty" - whatever that means. The Ost-Kommando, now independent in all but name, can give these otherwise promising Changeling officers a second chance at a military career." 
MAN_extra_6:0 "A National Bourgeoisie"
MAN_extra_6_desc:0 "If we wish to maintain our prosperity, the ponies of the former establishment should be further incorporated into our state apparatus. Power over civilian affairs is to be further devolved to the national bourgeoisie, comprised of the upper crust of pony society from whose ranks we found our collaborationist allies."
MAN_extra_7:0 "From the High Tower"
MAN_extra_7_desc:0 "While we have included the ponies in our government for the sake of unity, Lady Lilac is the one that guided the fledgling Protectorate into a modern state free from the stifling grip of Vesalipolis. Lady-Protectress Lilac is wise, and will continue managing the affairs of the Dominion and Federation from the Crystaller Building, with the help of her loyal Ost-Kommando."
#I seem to have skipped 8
MAN_extra_9:0 "Love is Reciprocal"
MAN_extra_9_desc:0 "The process of Love extraction had been one of the most controversial aspects of the early days of our rule. But that is no longer the case, as ponies realise that the benefit of our rule outweigh the hassle of the occasional Love feeding. After all, we provide security, stability, and prosperity, all in exchange for a reasonable quota of Love - a reciprocal and mutually-beneficial relationship."
MAN_extra_10:0 "Griffonia Trade Mission"
MAN_extra_10_desc:0 "For the past month, our delegates and consuls have been visiting the countries of Griffonia, bearing gifts from Manehattan and promises of lucrative business opportunities. As we finalise the details of a multilateral trade deal between the two continents, the symbolism of the occasion - Manehattan negotiating its own diplomatic affairs - is not lost on Lilac nor the Federation's citizens."
MAN_extra_center:0 "Amending Fences"
MAN_extra_center_desc:0 "The days of the Protectorate are behind us. No longer are we a territory to be assimilated into the greater Changeling Hegemony. Instead, we are a diverse nation, where pony and changeling work in tandem for a better future. In order to ensure good will, however, we will have to resolve long-standing conflicts stretching all the way back to the Great War. It's time to reconcile our differences."
MAN_extra_the_last_one_i_swear:0 "Leaving the Hive"
MAN_extra_the_last_one_i_swear_desc:0 "The day has finally come to end our status as a de-jure part of the Changeling Hegemony and transition into becoming an independent nation. The bird of Manehattan will finally be free from its cage. With one final stroke of bureaucratic genius, Lady-Protectress Lilac shall finally realise her dreams for a free and prosperous Dominion of the Federation of Eastern Equestria."

#ELF SECTION - FOCI
ELF_the_first_rays_of_sunlight:0 "First Rays of Sunlight"
ELF_the_first_rays_of_sunlight_desc:0 "When the princesses fell, Equestria trusted in Twilight Sparkle and her friends. When they were not enough, Equestria rallied its army to fight to the bitter end. When that was not enough, it now falls to the regular ponies of Equestria to fight. The dawn will come again, and we shall usher it in, so fight, Equestrians, fight like you've never fought before!"
ELF_our_liberatory_crusade:0 "Mobilise the Masses"
ELF_our_liberatory_crusade_desc:0 "Everypony who has not thrown in utterly with the changelings is our natural ally in this struggle. Politics, old grudges, differing philosophies or backgrounds, none of that matters right now. All that matters is to fight for freedom, and those who can aid us in this will be our comrades."
ELF_mobilise_the_masses:0 "Our Liberatory Crusade"
ELF_mobilise_the_masses_desc:0 "How many thousands of ponies have not suffered at the hooves of the changelings? Yet for each murdered or tortured pony, five more ponies have gritted their teeth in anger and despair. Now these ponies stand ready to fight and, if need be, die for Liberty."
ELF_right_1_a:0 "Send Out the Cadres"
ELF_right_1_a_desc:0 "Wherever we march forth, ponies come out cheering our triumphs and eagerly wanting to join the struggle. With resources put aside for the purpose, we can steadily let our numbers grow as we march forth, turning into an tsunami that will sweep the changelings away!"
ELF_right_1_b:0 "Brave Ponies of the Resistance, Rise Up!"
ELF_right_1_b_desc:0 "This is no simple war of front lines, this is a war for liberty, and borders and front lines do no matter to the rebels who skulk in the forests and mountains, waiting for their chance to strike. With our uprising advancing, these ponies are preparing to strike as well, and together we shall make Equestria boil with opposition to the invaders!"
ELF_right_2_a:0 "Harsh Times, Harsher Measures"
ELF_right_2_a_desc:0 "We stand on the brink, and cannot assume that we will ever get another chance like this. That is why we must make the most of it. For now, everything that does not contribute to this fight must be viewed as a distraction, and we must go in with single-minded determination. Yes it is harsh, and under normal circumstances we would never do this to our fellow ponies, but now we have to."
ELF_right_2_b:0 "Officialise the CMCs"
ELF_right_2_b_desc:0 "Who would have thought that the little fillies that ran across the fields of Ponyville, eager for their cutie marks, would grow up to be such inspiring figures in their own right? They are no longer children though, and their teachings can now inspire all the fillies of Equestria in the days to come."
ELF_right_3_a:0 "Enlist for Victory!"
ELF_right_3_a_desc:0 "Equestria still lives! She has not died yet, and she will not die as long as we refuse to admit defeat! When this war ends, where will you have been? Your family, your friends, your community and your world needs YOU to fight for her. Neither princesses nor heroes will win this war, but regular ponies will!"
ELF_right_3_b:0 "Weapons for the Revolution"
ELF_right_3_b_desc:0 "We have weapons for now, but the brutal war that is to come will require more. We must turn every factory and every workshop we can to arming our forces as quickly as we can, lest the changeling war machine crushes us under its sheer weight."
ELF_right_4_a:0 "Form the Flying Columns"
ELF_right_4_a_desc:0 "The Pegasi Corps of the Wonderbolts and many others were shattered during the invasion, but there's enough survivors left to reform that illustrious force in a new form. Leaving them as high-flying aces is too wasteful, and instead we must make sure they are used to bind our forces together the most efficiently."
ELF_right_4_b:0 "If We Must, We Shall Die..."
ELF_right_4_b_desc:0 "Life is the most precious thing a pony has, and no matter who she is, her passing is always a sad thing. Yet, right now we are in a battle for everypony's sake, and again and again trials come before us. Sometimes somepony must pay the ultimate price. It shouldn't have to be so, but that is why those who are prepared to sacrifice everything for their friends are heroes without equal."
ELF_right_final:0 "Found the Ponies' Liberation Army"
ELF_right_final_desc:0 "Our partisans, rebels and guerillas have fought and bled for month, and yet they have only grown stronger for it. We are no longer commanding a rag-tag band of brave resistance fighters, but rather we have been forged into a true army, one that will gear itself now to push back at the invaders, harder than ever before."
ELF_left_1_a:0 "Unity at All Costs"
ELF_left_1_a_desc:0 "We stand together, or we fall one by one. We have to address grievances when they arise at once, or simply demand that both parties put their differences aside. May Twilight Sparkle's lessons not fail us here, for without this trust and respect we may well end up faltering."
ELF_left_1_b:0 "Labour for the Home-Front"
ELF_left_1_b_desc:0 "It will take every single free pony in Equestria working day and night to carry on the fight. Railroads, factories, farms, hospitals and schools, it doesn't matter who they are, only what they can contribute, and if we all work together, hopefully no single pony will be over-burdened."
ELF_left_2_a:0 "Collectivise War Effort"
ELF_left_2_a_desc:0 "Our struggle isn't one between queen and princess, but between queen and regular ponies, and everypony has a stake in this fight. Everypony who knows something of use must be put where they will do the best, and we are not going to bandy about bits or rewards here. We are a family fighting as one now, and a family helps each other."
ELF_left_2_b:0 "Endorse the Bits Gun"
ELF_left_2_b_desc:0 "The Bits Gun is a fantastic weapon. It is cheap, sturdy and easy to produce, so let's distribute the blueprints for it so that everypony with even a simple garage of workshop can still help us arm our fighters. After all, nopony can do everything, but everypony can do something."
ELF_left_3_a:0 "Don't Forget Democracy"
ELF_left_3_a_desc:0 "Princess Trixie Lulamoon and Princess Starlight Glimmer does have a certain ring to it to many, but neither Trixie nor Starlight has entertained this notion. They refuse to become dictators, and instead they have ordered for something new; elections. Equestria could be trusted with fighting for its existence, then it can be entrusted with choosing its leaders."
ELF_left_3_b:0 "Freedom for the Liberated"
ELF_left_3_b_desc:0 "As we push forward, we don't want to leave just military garrisons in our wake. We know Equestria will be reborn, and the sooner the better, so let's dedicate some of our efforts to make sure that civil authority can be restored in the reclaimed homeland as soon as possible."
ELF_left_4_a:0 "Call On the Diaspora"
ELF_left_4_a_desc:0 "When Equestria fell, the fortunate managed to flee abroad, and they have watched their homeland be ravaged by the Changelings ever since. They haven't magically stopped being Equestrians though, and tens of thousands of those refugees are eager to rally to our cause, many times bringing friends or their new families with them as well."
ELF_left_4_b:0 "Revive Equestrian Institutions"
ELF_left_4_b_desc:0 "So many things were lost during the invasion, and the Equestria that arises after the war could well be unrecognizable if we don't take care to preserve those things. Equestria will be reborn, and we will make sure that for all the things that have changed, there will be things that remain the same as well."
ELF_left_final:0 "A Free Government"
ELF_left_final_desc:0 "One of the key things about the old Equestria was freedom. Ponies were free to live their lives, find their careers and purposes, express the ideas they had and criticize the powerful without risking retribution. These values will not be forgotten even after this brutal conflict, and Liberty, Friendship and Harmony shall be our guiding principles, now and forever."
ELF_middle_0:0 "Rally the Everfree"
ELF_middle_0_desc:0 "The Everfree Forest was a hotbed of resistance activity from the beginning of the invasion, and though there's still rebel activity in the forest, the various factions of the Everfree are scattered and divided. Yet, if we can convince them to join us we will be blessed with cadres of the most elite resistance fighters in all of Equestria."
ELF_middle_1:0 "Trust in the Duumvirs"
ELF_middle_1_desc:0 "Neither Starlight Glimmer nor Trixie Lulamoon is the kind of pony that the average Equestrian would have expected to lead this uprising, and yet they have risen to the call more than anypony else. They have sworn a solemn oath to restore Equestria, and the ELF has to put its trust in their sincerity."
ELF_middle_2:0 "Return of the Princess"
ELF_middle_2_desc:0 "Twilight Sparkle is the ordained successor of Celestia and Luna, this has been known for a long time. Now, in this age of strife, to have the Princess of Friendship back is a boon to Equestria like few others. Equestria isn't the same without its Alicorn rulers, and ponies are waiting with bated breath for the coronation." 
ELF_middle_3_a:0 "A Noble Cause"
ELF_middle_3_a_desc:0 "A surprising figure from the past has shown up in Equestria recently. Prince Blueblood, former Field Marshal of the Equestrian Armed Forces, has contacted the ELF to offer his services. Some are hesitant to accept the offer, blaming the fall of Equestria on him, but Starlight and Trixie knows what it's like to make amends."
ELF_middle_3_b:0 "The Magic of Friendship"
ELF_middle_3_b_desc:0 "Even after all the horrors of war and the countless challenges faced by Equestria, it is still a nation where the bonds between creatures, be they family, friends or whatever else, are highly valued. The war has not changed it, instead it has only reinforced the need to keep those bonds alive."
ELF_middle_4:0 "Equestria Reclaimed"
ELF_middle_4_desc:0 "Our rebel army has done the impossible: It has reclaimed Equestria, driven the changelings back from whence they came and delivered Equestria from the darkness! Equestria stands and Equestria remembers what she is, now and forever!"

ELF_postwar_1:0 "Where was Honesty?"
ELF_postwar_1_desc:0 "Applejack's whereabouts, at least, are known, but the news that she is held on charges of collaboration and using ponies as slave labour are beyond absurd. Princess Twilight's hooves are tied, but she has insisted on attenting the trials, desperate to find out what is going on."
ELF_postwar_2:0 "Where was Generosity?"
ELF_postwar_2_desc:0 "According to the official court statement, Rarity is held for collaboration with the Changelings. Apparently she was working alongside Suri Polomare, producing specialized uniforms for the Manehattan jägers. It is true that Rarity is a zealous fashionista, but this cannot be true, surely?"
ELF_postwar_3:0 "Where was Kindness?"
ELF_postwar_3_desc:0 "After the fall of Equestria Fluttershy vanished into the depths of the Everfree Forest. Ever since, even with repeated efforts, nopony has managed to find her. Princess Twilight has prepared herself to personally go into the forest and attempt to find her. Even if - Celestia forbid - she is no longer alive, then at least the matter will be put to rest."
ELF_postwar_4:0 "Where was Laughter?"
ELF_postwar_4_desc:0 "A letter has arrived from Rockville, asking for Princess Twilight to come. The terse message was very clear about asking that she arrived quietly. Since it concerns Pinkie Pie, the princess has no intention to not oblige."
ELF_postwar_5:0 "Where was Loyalty?"
ELF_postwar_5_desc:0 "Rainbow Dash has been missing ever since the fall of Equestria, and any attempts to find her have not met with success. Princess Twilight is awaiting news from the teams sent to investigate around Marechester, but for now, nothing has been found."
ELF_postwar_6:0 "Never Again"
ELF_postwar_6_desc:0 "Equestria has bled and suffered; maybe more so than ever before in its history. The dead count not in hundreds, but hundreds of thousands, and the destruction and disarray caused by the last years have left deep scars in the nation. Yet the war is over, and now Equestria can begin the long process of recovery."
ELF_postwar_7a:0 "The Reconstruction"
ELF_postwar_7a_desc:0 "The damage done across Equestria is immense, and though single buildings or blocks may be quickly restored, it will take years to truly bring back the splendor of the nation. Yet, in this rebuilding there is hope, and there is a chance to build even bigger and better than before."
ELF_postwar_7b:0 "The Agrarian Boom"
ELF_postwar_7b_desc:0 "With Equestria being as fertile as it is, much of the pre-war agriculture was surprisingly primitive. During the changeling occupation, however , most of the smaller farms were consolidated into large agricultural conglomerates. Time cannot really be turned back, but at least Equestria can make it right by those who lost their farms and homes, giving them a stake in these new giant farms."
ELF_postwar_7c:0 "Future of the Military"
ELF_postwar_7c_desc:0 "Even after all that has happened, few are seriously entertaining the notion that Equestria should become a fully militarized nation. Yet at the same time, it cannot go back to its old, peaceful ways. A balance needs to be struck here, and Equestria's approach to future wars must be realistic."
ELF_postwar_7d:0 "Future of the Peerage"
ELF_postwar_7d_desc:0 "One of the more sore points after the invasion is the Equestrian nobility, many of which collaborated with the changelings, and their position is now weak enough as Starlight Glimmer has pushed the idea of abolishing the institution fully."
ELF_postwar_7e:0 "The Manehattan Trials"
ELF_postwar_7e_desc:0 "While the trials against various collaborators has been an ongoing process, there are still several high profile cases left to deal with. These more notable collaborators have provoked immense ire, and with the situation stable enough in the nation, the trials can begin."
ELF_postwar_8a:0 "Question of the Market"
ELF_postwar_8a_desc:0 "In pre-war days, the local economies were afforded greater freedom than in most nations, but as with many things, we cannot go back to this. Equestria must have a single, unified philosophy regarding their economic approach, and both sides of the debate have rallied support. "
ELF_postwar_8b:0 "Question of the E.C.H.A." #Equestrian Commission for Harmonic Affairs
ELF_postwar_8b_desc:0 "With the princess preoccupied by her duties, the role of Equestria's champions and heroes must pass to other ponies. It has been proposed to formalize this role, creating a special service that reports directly to the princess and parliament and which can work to carry on this legacy."
ELF_postwar_9:0 "Peace in Our Time"
ELF_postwar_9_desc:0 "Through countless trials and countless sorrows, we nevertheless prevailed. The road was long and it was bloody, but now we can look to the future again. Once more, the sun rises above a prosperous and peaceful Equestria, and though the scars will never truly go away, she has not lost who she is."

Though she was feared dead, she was in the end sprung from captivity during the war of liberation. With Celestia and Luna both abdicating, they entrusted her with their powers and gave their blessings as she was elevated to the throne as the Princess of Harmony.\nWhatever Celestia saw in her protegé has been put on full display for Equestria. The democratic structures that arose during the war have been affirmed and Equestria's political stage opened up. She has worked tirelessly to elevate the ponies of Equestria from being subjects and making them her co-rulers via the ballot and the democratic process. With tireless effort, unequalled rigor and meticulousness and deep humility as well as the blessing of her now departed predecessor, Twilight Sparkle has set out to be a new kind of princess for a new age, one that can walk among her people and who elevates them instead of towering above them.§!"

MAN_ELF.1800.t:0 "The Manehattan Protectorate"
MAN_ELF.1800.d:0 "Equestria is over. The Changelings have won.\n\nFor the ponies, shock begins to shift into a more passive bleak helplessness. The war was horrifying and costly, and now it has ended in defeat. The whole of Equestria rocks back on its heels.\n\nThe victorious but over-extended changelings begin carving up their new territories into Commissariats and Protectorates, hoping to organize a new government swiftly before the malaise can become resentment. The Queendom is expanding, but for the moment, Chrysalis has extended to the breaking point of her reach.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBy Royal Charter of Her Majesty Queen Chrysalis, we have decided to create a new administrative entity centred around the city of Manehattan.\n\nFor this tremendous responsibility, the Queen has chosen a bug named Lilac, who, despite scoring high in her class at our military academies, has been relegated to administrative work for a long time, albeit on the Queen's General Staff. Such prior experience shall serve her well, though, as she will be given command over the Protectorate to be established in that region.\n\nManehattan's new 'Protectress' has few resources, fewer allies, and the meanest city in all of Equestria to tame. The question now is... will you go with her, Commander?"

MAN_ELF.1205.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Early this morning citizens of the [MAN.GetName] awoke to the sounds of screams and gunfire as pony resistance elements took to the streets in running battles with Changeling and Collaborationist forces in what is now considered to be mass spontaneous civil unrest in regions across the Protectorate. This eruption of seditious activity on such a large scale is alleged to be the first coordinated effort by the so-called "Harmonic Resistance" active on the eastern Equestrian seaboard. Hitherto unsubstantiated reports coming from sources in the Changeling administration allege that the "Harmonic Resistance" is in fact led by none other than the ponies known as "Starlight Glimmer" and "Trixie Lulamoon" - the former the progenitor of the failed ideology dubbed "Equalism", and the latter a washed-out street magician. Additional reporting to follow as further details emerge."

MAN_ELF.1206.d_hascore:0 "The inability of our commanders to prepare for the inevitability of what happened in [MAN_uprising_in_state_event_target.GetName] was just disgraceful, but at least we had managed to cling on to power in the state. Most importantly, the fact that we were still able, unprepared as we had been, to put down the unrest meant that the legitimacy of our governance over the Protectorate was still uncontested thus far.\nWe may have weathered the storm today, but the reports of our infiltrator agents in the field point towards a rising trend in anti-Changeling, pro-Harmonic, and secessionist thought amongst the general population of the Protectorate. Similar waves of unrest akin to what happened in the [MAN_uprising_in_state_event_target.GetName] region are certainties that we are sure to experience in the coming months.\nWe must stand against the tide and protect the Motherland from the pony rabble that would seek to destroy the hard-earned fruits of our conquest."
MAN_ELF.1206.d_lostcore:0 "The inability of our commanders to prepare for the inevitability of what happened in [MAN_uprising_in_state_event_target.GetName] was just disgraceful. The assessment of the extent of the damage caused to our administration is still in process, but it is undeniable that on a local level, the legitimacy of the Changeling mandate over the [MAN.GetName] has been dealt a severe blow by our failure to put down the unrest.\nIn post-unrest [MAN_uprising_in_state_event_target.GetName], it is being reported that civilian ponies are flaunting the 9p.m. curfew with impunity, the local Collaborationists are facing regular harassment and intimidation, petty offenses against the Changeling garrison has increased dozenfold, and, most terrifyingly, from the reports of our infiltrator agents in the field, anti-Changeling, pro-Harmonic, and secessionist sentiments have experienced exponential, uninhibited growth.\nIn essence, Changeling authority over the [MAN_uprising_in_state_event_target.GetName] region has been crippled. The prospect of more unrest to come is extremely alarming, to say the least."
MAN_ELF.1206.a:0 "We will be prepared next time."

MAN_ELF.2.t:0 "The Manehattan Nucleus"
MAN_ELF.2.d:0 "The time has come to begin entrenching our control over our Protectorate, and we have much to do. A first step is to acquire a base of operations that can support the undertaking of control over the great city of Manehattan. To that end, we have enlisted 84 Crystal Avenue to serve as our "nexus". Built during an economic boom during the recent era of prosperity in Equestria before our great war of conquest, it will serve us well in the times to come.\nOnce a proud symbol of Equestrian achievement, the tower now bustles with busy changelings. Orderlies carry stacks of paper past bored guards, their guns firmly in their grasp. Dignitaries visiting from Vesalipolis and engineers from Vraks on tours pass pony workers with downcast eyes and careful steps.\nEquestria is over. The Protectorate of Manehattan is now.\nThe city's new ruling Protectress is one Lilac, newly minted from the hive military academies. While universally acknowledged as intelligent and capable, she is extremely displeased with her assignment and anyone who has seen her knows it.\nA small party of well-dressed ponies arrive asking for an audience with the new Protectress, and she is about to pass them off to an orderly when they offer something naive yet interesting. Leading citizens, businessponies, and former civil servants have banded together to offer their services to the new regime. Her advisors scoff at the idea of pony collaborators, but Lilac treats them with a touch less derision, wondering if they might not be useful in the short term.\nThere is but one issue...\nAnd it is, of course, the ponies. The few allies we have made since our occupation began are all clamoring to work in this building, and some are even asking to live here!? Some in Lilac's staff are clamoring for the administration of the Protectorate to be a solely Changeling venture. Of course, everything in the building will be highly classified, and so it would be a severe risk to allow them to live there. But it could allow us to make nice with a few more locals."
MAN_ELF.2.a:0 "Who do those equinoids think they are!?"
MAN_ELF.2.b:0 "Alright, we'll help them move in."

MAN_ELF.3.t:0 "The Bridleway Parade"
MAN_ELF.3.d:0 "The Changeling Administration has organised a parade, as much as a show of force as a morale booster for the Garrison's personnel. Changelings march row on row down the world-famous Manehattan Bridleway, their impeccable lock-step a reminder of just how fragmentary and defeated the ponies are.\nIt's an impressive sight, to be sure, and your average pony is impressed. But there are a few weaknesses obvious to any more experienced observers. The garrison is lighter-equipped than it should be, and supply lines are over-burdened with the task of establishing control over such a vast prize as Equestria. The fearsome Changeling panzers are scarce, and the soldiers are not the brightly polished grenadiers of years past.\nStill, for all of that, the parade has its desired effect. The ponies of Manehattan know who their new masters are."
MAN_ELF.3.a:0 "Our Victory Resonating for a Thousand Years!"

MAN_ELF.4.t:0 "Rebuilding the Bronclyn Bridge"
MAN_ELF.4.d:0 "In order for the Protectorate government to have any legitimacy with the people we must try to make ammends with them in one way or another. Protectress Lilac may not be thrilled to rot away behind a desk in Manehattan, but she's not an idiot. If she doesn't shape this city and the surrounding towns into shape, this house of cards is falling on her head specifically. So! Rebuilding it is.\nOne proposal is the rebuilding of the famous Bronclyn bridge in Manehattan that took a severe battering when the victorious Changeling army occupied the city. On this issue two competing factions vie for supremacy; our more ardent militarists call for the demolition of what remains of the old bridge in favour of a wholly new edifice, built in the Changeling architectural tradition as an ode to our victory. The moderate (and perhaps more sensible) faction wishes to limit the construction work to a conservative restoration of the bridge to its original pre-war appearance.\nLilac needs to give the ponies and what not of Manehattan fewer reasons to fight back. Inviting the Collaborators into government has helped with this, as have curbing some of the behavior of her officers. But rebuilding the famous Bronclyn bridge is sure to make even the more resentful little equinoids pause when considering rebellion. The bridge will also signal a return to business as usual, with access to the city restored to the outside world. We can only hope that with the rebuilding, that this great metropolis on the frontiers of the Hegemony will be peaceful soon."
MAN_ELF.4.a:0 "The rebuilt bridge shall be an ode to the splendor of the Changeling Race."
MAN_ELF.4.b:0 "We need the support of the populace; just repair the damage and leave it as is."

MAN_ELF.5.t:0 "Too Much Paperwork!"
MAN_ELF.5.d:0 "Dominion is more theory than fact until you inhabit the land, or at least that's what Vesalipolis has decided. With our occupation of Manehattan, we have acquired its large population and significant industrial base, but we have also inherited all of its issues. Foremost of said issues is the crowded urban environment and restive slums of the city.\nQueen Chrysalis has dispatched settlers across the continent, and after pulling a few strings, Protectress Lilac has secured a few thousand settlers for Manehattan. Entailingly, she has initiated plans to redevelop the inner city, clearing out the slums and creating new neighbourhoods for Changeling settlement and industrial development.\nUnfortunately, this does mean that we'll have to expend some resources and time preparing living space for them. Some old tenement buildings and decrepit corner stores are going to be razed to make way for sensible, sturdy Changeling-style hive-blocks.\nThe plan, though suitably ambitious, seems highly unfeasible at the moment. With our garrison overstretched and wholly incapable of pacifying dissent and unrest in Equestria's largest city, some of our officers have suggested enlisting the help of the pony collaborationists in our attempt to remake the city in our own image."
MAN_ELF.5.a:0 "Make our pony collaborators do the dirty work."
MAN_ELF.5.b:0 "For Changelings, by Changelings!"

MAN_ELF.6.t:0 "Scouring the Maneway"
MAN_ELF.6.d:0 "Lilac and the Ost-Kommando were at an impasse. The Maneway was an important piece of infrastructure, large portions of which had been bombed to rubble by our aces during the war, leaving it in a state of disrepair and an inconvenience for those within the city. The Collaborationist establishment, and most normal ponies in general, were beginning to wonder when it'd be restored, and thus such discussions were had by Lilac and her administration.\nReports indicate that the subway system is infested with the fighters of the Harmonic Resistance. The officers of the Ost-Kommando dreaded sending their forces down there - half of them were already trying to quell uprisings in other parts of the Protectorate, and had no soldiers to spare. The Maneway was only useful for the soldiers in Manehattan proper, anyways.\nOn the other hoof: the subway would help everyone, at least those within Manehattan. To the Manehattanites, the subway was integral to their daily commute, and it would help stabilise the metropolis and its surrounds if ponies could actually traverse their city with relative ease.\nIn the event that the Maneway is chosen to be slated for repairs, the Ost-Kommando faces a daunting task: the only way to feasibly clear out such infrastructure is a form of scorched earth warfare, sending in jaegers with flamethrowers to scour out any squatters or resistance fighters using it as a hub, with the collateral damage this approach entails.\nThis really was an impasse, literally and figuratively. We could forgo the Maneway and divert our resources to what some would perceive as more pressing concerns. Or: we could act pre-emptively, sending in the Manehattan garrison to exterminate an infestation before it became unmanageable."
MAN_ELF.6.a:0 "Report to headquarters that all is well, there is no need to worry."
MAN_ELF.6.b:0 "Send in the jaegers to flush the rats out from the tunnels."

MAN_ELF.7.t:0 "Consolidate Confiscated Assets"
MAN_ELF.7.d:0 "Part of conquest is counting and repurposing the spoils of war. It's just the natural course of action after victory to take what you've won! Our Garrison dispatched several detachments to do just that, with jaegers knocking on doors to announce new management. While those who will soon be in our employ have not had much to say, which is proper, the old proprietors have been rather heated about the whole affair. Namely, the board of governors of the East Coast Chamber of Commerce, who, in addition to being highly influential in the city's finance sector, are also trying hard to retain their independence under the new regime.\nWere they not ponies, and not a conquered people, Lilac might have been concerned. As it was, they are both. And yet...\nShe thinks to the collaborators who offered to smooth her way in this sprawling city. Perhaps making some exceptions now will net us benefits in the future."
MAN_ELF.7.a:0 "Distasteful, but we need the support of the business interests."
MAN_ELF.7.b:0 "They are just a bunch of jumped-up accountants, replace them all!"

MAN_ELF.8.t:0 "[GetDateText] - Maneway Bombed!"
MAN_ELF.8.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Terror and chaos rule as ponies and changelings alike are caught in massive explosions along the Maneway. In the midst of repairs, Manehattan's revitalized and rebuilt main drag has been torn to shreds. Lilac is furious, and more than that completely baffled. What was the point? Why do this? She had rebuilt it for them! She had done these ungrateful ponies a favor and they had repaid her with bombs.\nOn the streets, her officers struggle to restore order and keep ponies off the street. In their gilded offices and boardrooms, the pony collaborators discuss how they will respond. And in the middle of it all, the Protectress of Manehattan decides what is to be done."
MAN_ELF.8.a:0 "We will have an emergency meeting."

MAN_ELF.9.t:0 "Inspecting the Garrison"
MAN_ELF.9.d:0 "In light of her difficulties, Lilac has called for aid from the empire while working to strengthen her control over Manehattan. The collaborators must be organized, the military districts rationalized, the chain of command straightened out and strengthened. But more than any of that, Lilac has a lackluster garrison to handle.\nThe Manehattan garrison isn't the dregs, but they are understrength and without much armor. The biggest problem now is numbers. For all of their superior firepower and training, the Changeling garrison just does not have the numbers to hold back a true insurrection with an organized core. The Ost-Kommando has suggested lowering their training standards temporarily to raise a large force capable of watching everyone and everything.\nAlternatively, a selection of Lilac's officers put forth a proposal to double down on Changeling strengths, focusing on hitting hard and fast with elite and highly mobile forces. A large army of half-trained fools may be able to sit and watch everything, but feeding and paying them will be a drain on our resources. Better to have a smaller force that can respond quickly and effectively at a moment's notice."
MAN_ELF.9.a:0 "We can't be picky."
MAN_ELF.9.b:0 "We must maintain some standards."

MAN_ELF.10.t:0 "Hunters of the Concrete Jungle"
MAN_ELF.10.d:0 "Dim lamps. Empty streets. Dark alleyways filled with trash, discarded furniture, broken glass. The pony hurtling down the narrow passageway in between two skyscrapers doesn't see the patch of slick grease that coats the concrete, slips and falls. The dull, rhythmic thud of jackboots pounding towards her from behind makes her struggle valiantly to stand up and flee, before a rubber bullet knocks her into the pavement.\nWhen had it gone so wrong? Maybe it was when Silver Shine stopped coming to meetings and nopony bothered to check up on him. Or when the creature wearing his face and speaking with his voice turned up unexpectedly one day, and they were so happy to see him again they didn't notice the odd, stilted mannerisms, or the maniac gleam in his eyes. Or, even after he'd ripped out the throat of their cell leader, when they'd decided to stand their ground against the jaegers, who'd put down their doomed resistance with such practiced ease.\nThe pony knows that none of her friends had managed to get out. They'd barricaded themselves in the back room where they'd thought the heavyset steel door would buy them time, until the changelings had started shooting through the walls. She'd barely escaped by jumping out of a window. She was alone as she ran through the twisting back streets of Hayston, fleeing from the truncheons and bayonets of her pursuers.\nThe face that glances down at her is obscured by the cowls of the gas mask, but for the pair of compound eyes that shine a dull blue through the tinted lens. Juxtaposed against the monotone anonymity of the mask and the dark gloom of the alleyway walls, those eyes are vivid, and hold her gaze. It is the last thing the pony will ever see."
MAN_ELF.10.a:0 "Masters of the Hunt."

MAN_ELF.11.t:0 "The Protectress' Blacklist"
MAN_ELF.11.d:0 "The authority of the Protectorate is challenged at every turn, and so we must endeavour to change that. Using tried and true tactics, we believe the best way to do that is to ensure no one is left alive who would challenge us. Changeling Intelligence is to compile a blacklist of all known and suspected dissidents residing in the Protectorate for surveillance, detainment, or elimination.\nNow it is past midnight, and the lights on the top floor of the Crystaller Tower are on. Lilac's aides chitter and murmur over half-eaten food and piles of paper, throwing names at each other and making snap decisions. Sapphire Starlight? Irrelevant. Haberdasher Silver? Too marginal. Seraph Scales? Alright, put her on the stack.\nLilac, deciding to do more than rule from a distance, puts her staff to work compiling a list of the city's top minds. The artists, the poets, the analysts, the scholars, the socialites, the gregarious rich, the veterans, even the pop stars are sorted into piles. Some are useless and not worth the energy. Some are too dangerous, and need to be marginalized, shamed, or intimidated. Arranged before these busy drones lies a constellation of ponies the regime finds potentially useful, ponies to be courted for their influence and offered deals and jobs to secure their grudging loyalty."
MAN_ELF.11.a:0 "It's all coming up Lilac."

MAN_ELF.12.t:0 "Lilac's Visit to the Manehattan Polytechnic"
MAN_ELF.12.d:0 "As quoted from Queen Chrysalis herself: "The smart ones are always the first to cause trouble".\nAnd so Protectress Lilac planned to end that problem before it can even begin.\nLate last night, squads of Changelings jaegers from across the Protectorate gathered on street corners and alleyways in the middle of downtown Manehattan. Normally such an important operation would be touted and hinted at by our propagandists in order to drive up fear and anxiety, as a form of psychological warfare. This operation, however, would be all dark.\nThe Manehattan Polytechnic institute was a focal point for engineering, the sciences, and higher education in general in the city, but its main campus building, open to the public, served little academic use, and the historic structure was instead rumoured to be a hotbed of Resistance activity.\nThis would be ended fast. Under the cover of darkness, the jaegers approached on all sides and placed barrels of kerrosine oil all along the outside of the building. Then, Lilac herself, an engineer by training, short-circuited the electrical system and set it all alight. The fire department arrived but it was too late. The symbol of learning under Celestial rule was gone, reduced to ashes.\nIn all honesty, Lilac didn't really have that much concrete evidence that the campus building was indeed a hotbed of resistance activity. But she had faith in her rumours, and at any rate it was better to be safe than sorry."
MAN_ELF.12.a:0 "What else did Chrysalis say? Ah yes, "I am Inevitable"."

MAN_ELF.13.t:0 "Dinner at the Crystaller Building"
MAN_ELF.13.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Charm and glitter abound at the Crystaller Building tonight, as the Lady Protectress of Manehattan entertains the wealthy and powerful of the city with a lavish dinner party at Changeling headquarters. The Protectress was reported to be highly active at the dinner, moving between tables wining and dining with her guests. Amongst them were big names such as fashionista Suri Polomare and former Wonderbolt Wind Rider, both of whom have publicly voiced their support for the new regime.\nA guest at the party who wishes to remain unnamed said that "Everything was great - the food, the wine, the conversation. Lilac strikes me as an ASTUTE LEADER ha ha, though I wish her fangs weren't so sharp."\nReporting for the Manehattan Herald, Zanx Sorhia."

MAN_ELF.14.t:0 "Concert Night in Manehattan"
MAN_ELF.14.d:0 "Changeling arts have not been widely embraced or celebrated away from the hives. So it was with some surprise that the ponies of Manehattan discover that Changelings actually have a long and varied tradition of art music. Selections from Georg Fredric Chitindel and Amadeus Chrysalidus fill the city's music halls and for the first time warble out from old turntable speakers. And it's good!\nLilac invites some of the Hegemony's finest musicians to Manehattan, and some of the best of Manehattan's music scene to collaborate together in a concert at Carneighie Hall for the city's edification. Ticket sales are through the roof, and for the first time in a long time ponies and changelings alike are genuinely excited about something despite themselves."

MAN_ELF.15.d:0 "Tragedy strikes!\n\nAs the joint Changeling-Pony Orchestra takes a well-deserved bow amidst thunderous applause, explosions rock the theatre. Loose masonry and dust kicked up by the explosion peppers the terrified crowd as Lilac and her staff are swiftly evacuated. Changeling sentries in elaborate dress uniform shield the musicians as they flee back behind the stage, and there is gunfire that later no one can place.\nThe whole city is thrown into chaos, with rumors flying that the Protectress was killed or that the shadowy leaders of Manehattan's fledgling rebel faction were caught in their own blast. Stories that ELF partisans have taken several neighborhoods threatens to become reality as panicked and emotional ponies rush to secure their homes and the safety of their loved ones. Soldiers are paralyzed as their commanders find their lines of communication cut. A mob of ponies trample down a Changeling officer in the theatre and a half dozen civilians are gunned down as they try to force their way into the streets.\nLilac, her chitin cracked from a stray piece of shrapnel, brushes the blood from her eyes and tells her guards to find her a phone.

Furious soldiers find troublemakers, ponies who sometimes just look a bit rough, the neighborhood tousled-headed youth who needs to learn when to shut his mouth, and begin shooting. Only a few dozen die, but the effect is immediate. The shooting of one or two silences whole blocks as the riotous rabble realizes that, no, they aren't ready to face the changelings outside.\nLilac acts in anger, but also out of a strange sort of heartbreak. She regrets the reports. She knows that they didn't catch those responsible. But it doesn't matter. She does what she needs to do. Isn't she a better sort of ruler, really the ally of these poor, stupid ponies? Or something? What was the point of all of this? What was she going to do?"

MAN_ELF.17.d:0 "Our counter-insurgency office has codebreakers and officers working around the clock. The Manehattan Office of Public Safety never sleeps. Tonight is no different... except that tonight, the MO-oPS is about to finally catch its elusive prey.\nUsing Celestial cypher machines from the great war, resistance groups have maintained the ability to encrypt their messages to a high quality that has been difficult for even our codebreakers to deal with. But with the advent of new decryption technology from scientists in the cold north of the continent, we believe we have discovered a way to figure out the source of a transmission without even needing to know what it says. Triangulated radio signals, a fully parsed code, even brief infiltrations have all confirmed the location of a single source from which many of the resistance transmissions around Manehattan stem, and our soldiers now prepared to move in.\nThe location is a seemingly unthreatening cabin in the forests outside of the city. The security is light by our standards, with no guards at all and a very simple magical ward to keep sound from leaking out of the room. Could it be this easy?\nThe jaegers that have moved in at night are ordered to bring it down. Tear gas shells are fired, flashbangs are set off and the compound falls like a wet paper bag.\nAlmost literally.\nWhen our units reached the inside they found only three unarmed ponies and a high-powered radio.\nAfter some investigation, it turned out that the messages we had been trying to break were just complete and utter gargle, and this station's only goal was to just keep putting out nonsense. Now we can consider this a victory, as we can still show off these captives and their radio. But we also found more information about other cells, though we can only pursue one course of action, as those cells will surely grow suspicious and relocate if this radio goes dark for too long."

This was supposed to be a quick and easy trip - her assistants would find which factory had the best performance and she would go there, say how great they were doing, praise the Queen and get it over with.\nBut someone made a wrong choice.\nBecause when the Protectress showed up at the factory, she was fired on by Resistance members, but not in large enough numbers that they could have been expecting her, though.\nNo, this unfortunate encounter seemed to have happened purely by chance. After her guards subdued the factory, the irony of the situation revealed itself. The factory WAS indeed extremely productive, and moreover, many of the workers there were sympathetic to the new regime - seeing as they had been former collaborationists who the Resistance had captured and coerced into working at this factory.\nNow comes a choice for Lilac. The Garrison can either seize control of the new industry and operate it directly, or turn it over the these newly-liberated collaborationists and reinforce the loyalty of her "allies" in Manehattan."
MAN_ELF.18.d_2:0 "Constabulary Inspector Calloused Hooves finds himself facing a dilemma.\nHis report on the collaborator enterprises in the city's historic industrial zone is a mess. Objectively, many of the factories are underperforming.

Bribes that he's almost inclined to take, considering that sparing many of the least offensive collaborator-run manufactories might be best in the long run for productivity. Even the workers in the worst mills feared Changeling overseers running their workplaces directly.\nFor that matter, if he painted too dire a picture, would they do something drastic?"

With this we should make a show out of this as much as possible. Lilac has arranged for grenade fireworks and rocket barrages! Just a lot of explosives, really.\nCome twilight a few hours later, and the Crystaller Building is all aglow with a gathering of Manehattan's finest and most important Changelings. Manehattan has seen hundreds and hundreds of balls over the years, but perhaps none like this: a Masque of, well, Gas-Masks. Every Changeling attending the festivities sports some kind of gas mask, spruced up in gaudy and often macabre ways. After all, it is under the aegis of the Lady Protectress that the frontier of chemical warfare is ever being pushed forwards within Manehattan's laboratories, and everypony in attendance knows it. So novel is the night that Trimmel himself is in attendance!\nThis carnivalesque spectacle is a great entertainment for Lilac's generals, who take the opportunity to indulge in drunkenness and shocking the few pony guests and workers. The night is a success as far as its hosts are concerned, but stories from the pony waitstaff filter down into the city.\nTrimmel, highly drunk, makes a promise to a similarly-intoxicated Lilac. She may make one request of him of anything to help her govern the Protectorate, and he will grant it."

When there are no consequences and no one can stop you, petty vandalism loses its appeal fast.\nThe distant sounds of police sirens catches both of their attention. Lilac curses soddenly in their direction, vowing to personally trash the collaborator Constabulary for daring to do something about her reign of terror. Do they call it a night, or go out with a bang? Because Trimmel does have one last idea..."

The Manehattan harbor defenses include several wide-bore gun batteries meant for repelling capital ships and any amphibious landings. But they've not been fired in so long! Surely its best to make sure, for the sake of defense, that they are still in top shape?\nThe 12-gun salute that wakes the still slightly-drunk Changeling high command has no explanation. No one ordered it, and there are no targets. Middle-level officers start organizing their commands into defensive positions, and Lilac's generals lock the city down. Search parties are dispatched in every borough looking for terrorists fleeing the scene of some hitherto-unlocated bombing. Jaeger fliers flit from neighborhood to neighborhood looking for evidence of the attack.\nTrimmel and Lilac, now friends for life, are found that morning passed out next to the harbor guns."

The more she screams, the more eyes are on her, until the newly minted Collaborationist Constabulary do arrive.\nLilac tears off her mask and taunts them, and before they can ascertain whether or not she is actually the Protectress, she punts two of them into next week.\nThe next hour is a blur as Lilac and Trimmel avoid the confused cops and somehow collect a few disaffected equine youths on their way to breaking the windows of the local police station and trashing the offices while Lilac's personal guard pushes its way in to take her into protective custody. The Constabulary spread stories about just how wanton Lilac can be."

These last few months have been a trying time for all of us. Terrorist bombings have disrupted our lives, causing privation and fear. But I am proud to say that we have endured."\nAs she speaks, Protectress Lilac works towards a central point, one she's worked on all week. Cementing her rule will mean cementing her image, and this is where she intends to make that image clear.\n"I wish to prove to you tonight that we are not your enemies and that all can, and will, benefit from our new relationship. We hold a special bond in this land of ours. One forged in the unfortunate sacrifices of the Equestrian soldiers, fighting for a Diarchy that didn't care for them, and the Changeling race, who rebuilt what had been lost under the cruel domination of the Alicorns.

There are propaganda posters plastered in and outside of Protectorate offices declaring that the Spyeye Program is here to protect the good citizens of Manehattan. Posters in the streets tote it as a crime fighting measure, or as an anti-insurgency measure, or as some vague security bit.\nIt has haunted the minds of Resistance members and Collaborationists alike, and even some Changelings as well, as they begin to worry that the regime of the Lady Protectress is continuously watching them. And everywhere the Spyeye slogan appears in big, bold, red: "THE INNOCENT HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR", ringing loud and clear what serving the state can give you.\nSome posters and graffiti are just baffling. The slogans are vague or just openly sinister, the imagery frankly unkind. Questions directed to the collaborationist government return a dozen different answers, all contradictory, and all of them official. Cameras watch ponies in the street. Cameras watch other cameras. Ponies watch each other and no one is watching Lilac except when she wants everyone to be watching her.\nThere was only one issue with Spyeye.\nIt doesn't exist.\nThe whole thing is an elaborate propaganda stunt made to show some progress to [CHN.Capital.GetName] of progress that has been made against the Resistance.\nThe truth is that Spyeye is part surveillance system and part propaganda drive. The "real" material part of the program is merely an extreme stepping up of surveillance in public and private spaces. The true meat of the program is a massive, almost impossible to grasp system of chaos, misdirection, misinformation, and constant paranoia.\nAnd yet, it ended up working. The trickery on such a massive scale lead to the ability of the state to actually manage anti-insurgent operations more effectively. Now they just need to choose a focus."

"Oh, dear, I am so sorry! But you know how things go. When I do not get answers... My love for my queen is just so strong, it overcomes me! I am awfully passionate.\nShe growls, but the officer takes no heed. When the Changeling bodyguard steps out of the shadows, the officer puts a hoof up to wave him off. "Nein, I can handle this."\nTurning to the pony on the floor, the officer says: "Liebchen, I understand what it means to have convictions. But wouldn't it be nice to have a full meal, maybe even something for the pain? Hm?"\nWhen the officer emerges from the showers a few hours later, he grasps a sheaf of stained papers - a list of names that the pony had eventually, inevitably, given up.

The insurgency was ideological and radical, and would never accept quislings.\nApparently, we were wrong. There is a clear line of communication between our collaborators and the leadership of the Harmonic Resistance. While the collaborationist leaders and influencers have not completely gone over to the foe, they are not turning them in either. The infiltration goes deeper than we could have imagined. Even as our jaegers move in on the treacherous collaborationists and bring them back to us kicking and screaming, we can only pray that irreparable damage has not been done."

The process of acquiring it not only drains the populace, but with her limited personnel it has become prohibitively inefficient.\nCertain risks come with this approach. Chrysalis is famously challenging of any of those who question her judgement, and she had personally approved of the tax. Lilac would do well to tread carefully.\nOr maybe not. The Protectress has decided to go into this meeting with a new philosophy - that she shall win the day through sheer confidence or die trying.\nChrysalis, acutely aware of how much her new realm needs a steady supply of Love to prosper, nevertheless hears her governor out.

But instead, the military ensign of the Ost-Kommando was raised directly beside the Royal standard, if a bit lower.

Whatever plans Lilac and her friends had had in mind for the evening, though, were quickly disrailed as news came in of explosions deep within the subterranean tunnels of the Maneway.\nLilac feels a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach as the messenger delivers his report. Around her, the party is breaking up - the frenetic sound of hushed, hurried conversations are occasionally punctuated by distant explosions, as the bombs of the Harmonic Resistance continue to go off somewhere in the city below. A clutch of officers, uniforms in disarray, rush through the crowd towards the elevators, no doubt in a hurry to return to their commands.\nTensions run high, as Lilac's subordinates break out into arguments over who should bear responsibility for the attack, their anger now directed towards their own fellows.

The government has recently unveiled a new factory there that shall produce goods for our military. In this, we have been approached by two companies who have stated their willingness to take ownership of the factory and ally themselves with the government, tying our fates together.\nFirst is the Nidhogg Company, a smaller Changeling backed corporation that would serve us dutifully and well in having this contract.\nThough, on the other hoof, we have also been approached by the remnants of the once massive Fillydelphia Motors, who in their newfound desperation have offered their own contract which would grant us much prestige.\nOr we could force them to share, if only to humiliate this remnant of Equestrian rule."

There are two available, which should be a blessing, but one of them is the fallen giant of Equestrian engineering - Fillydelphia Motors - and the other is the infamous Niddhogg company.\nThere's a lot of weight in the choice. Both are viable options, but Niddhogg is a purely Changeling enterprise and the local industry could use the lift. Supporting Changeling superiority might pay off, but it may alienate the collaborationists whom the Protectorate has come to rely on for its day-to-day operations.\nOf course, Lilac rules by decree and the Lady's word is law.

The mudponies and the hornheads will work and be the labor force that is below us, like in the old days, where we, the pegasi protected them and in return, they provided us with food and luxuries as it should be.\nThe ponies who have voluntarily joined this impending restructuring of society, or those who will join it, have to decide if they will participate with all their hearts and minds or if they will resist it. That will not change what will happen. You can be sure, that once the resistance has rooted out of the sewers, they will not allow the old Equestria to come back. If even the Alicorns with all their power and might could not, then all the mudponies cannot either. If you have understood recent history, you will know that it is not possible either.\nNow, pegasi and children of the new order, arise and bring forth the storm!\nWind Rider stepped back and listened to the stamps in the ground from the pegasi on the ground.

I know that a lot of ponies would prefer to go on about how we'd never achieve anything else, much like how a lot of pegasi went on about how we were lessened as a people after Heart's Warming. After all, weren't we reduced when the three tribes became one? Weren't we left at the mercy of other, more simpering ponies who didn't acknowledge our ancient traditions?  The fact of the matter is simple when you strip away all the nonsense. We are pegasi, and we are born warriors. It was what Commander Hurricane led us to be, and it was what Flash Magnus was when he showed the world the true mettle of a pegasus.\nI am not going to deny that there's pegasi out there who claim that apparently it is our duty to fight the changelings, resist to the bitter end and all. I wonder what those pegasi would say when Flash Magnus asked us why we remain managing the weather for entitled mudcrawlers, or why Commander Hurricane asked what happened to the martial pride of our people. Isn't it strange that all these ancient heroes seem to have just... died out when we united with the other tribes? Maybe, or maybe it makes perfect sense.\nPegasi of East Equestria, you're here because I see in you the ability to restore our old pride. We can become the Pegasi we were once again, cut free from the fetters of the earth. So what will it be? Will you coddle these mudcrawlers or are you going to remember what you are? We are pegasi, we are warriors born and true, and I say that for the first time in centuries, we are what we're meant to be. So you know what, fellow sky-climbers?

While in controlled doses the plant has medicinal uses, it's often used instead for as a calming and euphoric-inducing drug. Previously the underground market was squashed under Princess Celestia's rule, and even legitimate use of the herb was all but prohibited.\nWith the Equestrian government gone, however, a new black market of valerian has formed. It's still in its early stages, barely covering a few neighbourhoods of downtown Manehattan, and can be stopped quickly enough. Interestingly enough, these same neighbourhoods showed a sharp decline in noncompliance and resistance from the residents. Further investigation revealed that valerian is likely inducing many potential troublemakers into a state of calm and reduced stress.\nIn an unorthodox move, the local chief of police has launched an initiative to legitimatise the market by supporting the efforts of the criminals. Our goal would be to 'sling' as much of the drug within the pony residents of Manehattan. We could perhaps spread its use beyond the city and elsewhere.\nOf course, we should reward those who are willing to cooperate.

At some point last week, she had apparently agreed to personally oversee a trial for a collaborationist that was accused of embezzling funds.\nShe didn't know she was even qualified to preside over a trial, but now, that was besides the point. The officials had paperwork with her signature, so she had no choice.\nSeated at the judge's bench, wearing a poofy wig and bulky robes, she was ready to throw her chintous hooves up and scream that she didn't really want to be here. One by one, the rest of the court filed in.\nThe matter was a small and private one, consisting only of a few individuals, and if she had digits on her hooves (although she was sure she could shapeshift a few if she wanted) she could probably count them on ten of those. The repertoire of individuals are as follows; herself, the prosecution, representing an anonymous officer of the Ost-Kommando, and the accused pony in question.\n"Pokey Pierce, assistant accountant to the Constabulary Department of Requisitions," she began, looking to the folder before her with a long, LONG, pause. She probably should've at least read up on the case before coming to the courtroom. "You are charged with Embezzlement, Fraud, and Larceny, at the expense of the City of Manehattan, to a total account of approximately fifty thousand Manehattanite Bits, for the purpose of..."

The local pony population was encouraged and advocated to be especially polite towards all the new changeling settlers, especially the ones within the military and administrative apparatuses. The ponies could express their positivity and politeness towards their new compatriots through affectionate words, congratulations, even gifts, and of course, signs of bodily affection, with the most notable and mostly encouraged being hugs.\nIt is hoped among the leadership of the Protectorate that, through this holiday, positive vocal and physical interactions and overt displays of affection between changelings and ponies will become normalized in the minds of the locals.\nHowever, while the majority of the population did indeed participate nominally in the festivities of the day, and did show ostensible positivity towards their local changelings, there have been those who were far less cooperative. These citizens, instead of showing affection towards their new friends, chose to ignore the events happening, or even worse, openly show negative emotions, such as anger, hatred, or even ridicule, actions which must of course be considered as unacceptable, and dealt with as thus. Some of these ponies would even use the atmosphere of positivity and affection in order to harm changeling citizens through emotionally-manipulative means. Of course such transgressions cannot be allowed, and those who reacted with either ignorance or anger will be reminded of how true and proper citizens and compatriots of the [MAN.GetName] should act."

The Lady Protectress herself emerged from the Crystaller with Queen's Guard commander Tantalus in tow, and after a brief discussion the trucks were allowed to leave.

The letter concludes with a thinly-veiled threat against any sort of separatism on the part of Lilac's regime.\nIt is clear that our overlords back home will not dare to intervene directly, militarily or otherwise, in the affairs of the [MAN.GetName]. They are simply too overextended dealing with the occupation of the rest of Equestria to risk the East Coast descending into civil war. That being said, Lilac has to cautiously consider her response to Chrysalis.

Her gamble had paid off; when push came to shove, her titular overlords in distant Vesalipolis had backed down. The Ost-Kommando had never been able to rely on the central government for much help, so they had always had to go it alone. Manehattan has thusly earned its autonomy through hard work and determination, Lilac reasoned as she left the meeting room. On second thought, that sentiment had seemed a bit simplistic, and besides, a higher degree of autonomy alone would hardly be the answer to the turbulent mess that was the Protectorate of Manehattan.\nBut still! A small victory is a victory nonetheless, and such triumphs are few and far between in the nerve-wracking grind that is the governance of the East Coast. Lilac decides to make the most out of her new-found autonomy as Lady Protectress, and begins to plan another celebratory party at the Crystaller Building - hopefully to be funded by the 300% increase in the tariffs on changeling trade that she has in mind."

They claim that the institution has been "butchered", for the lack of a better term, as the only currently operational departments are those limited to science, engineering or mathematics. Some had even dared claim that the [MAN.GetRulingParty] had conducted a de-facto purge of the University, expelling, firing, or even detaining many previously notable members of the faculty and student body on unclear charges.\nThe official response to such criticism was the statement that other departments, namely the faculties of Social Sciences, History, and Law, were hotbeds of "Political Radicalism" and were filled with "potentially-insurrectionist elements", though it was reported that, "pending ideological reform for state security", these departments might be opened again in the future."

From Manehattan, they had boarded an armoured train which took them along the coastline, making good time to the industrialised city of Albion. Greeted by officers from the local section of the Manehattan Office of Public Safety, the entourage had taken a night to map out the surroundings, counter-referencing their research with their intelligence on the history and possible fate of the Morning Walker, gleaned from the interrogations of captured Equestrian military officials.\nA Vanhoover-Class battleship, the Morning Walker, as far as seized Equestrian military records indicate, was only three-quarters complete by the time the Changeling advance threatened its home port, causing it to flee north, semi-finished with a skeleton crew, where it foundered off the coast of Albion following some obscure shipboard accident. The Ost-Kommando's review of the official narrative and the subsequent skepticism towards its truthfulness led to an investigation of the battleship's true fate; if rediscovered and captured on the Ost-Kommando's own initiative, not only would the Morning Walker grant the Protectorate significant naval power, but also prove to the Hegemony that Lilac's administration was capable of providing for itself - not that Vesalipolis had ever done much to support the Protectorate either.\nLilac was tired, her uniform stained and muddied from the hours of continuous trekking, bushwacking through the dense undergrowth and clambering over rocky hillsides. Her muscles burned, her meticulously-groomed appearance had gradually come undone, and yet it was the most alive she'd felt for months. The sun was quickly sinking beyond the horizon as they approached a patch of flat ground bordering a small inlet, at the end of which were cliffs leading to the sea.\nIt was at the fringes of the grassland, where another step further would have sent her plummeting into the wave-beaten rocks, that Lilac's order to make camp was strangled in her throat, as she realised that the leafy boughs swinging from side to side beyond the cliff's edge were not trees on the opposing cliffsides, but rather, the vine-covered lattice masts of a great battleship - the Morning Walker - snugly moored inside the inlet.\nThe next morning, as the reinforcements she had radioed in from Albion were getting the ship seaworthy for its voyage to Manehattan, Lilac sat up outside her tent and enjoyed the sunrise over the ocean."

Well-connected with the scrawny but highly advanced military-industrial complex under the Diarchy, the scientists were eventually persuaded to impart to us their knowledge of Equestrian weapon systems development. Most interesting amongst the findings from the report is the indication of the existence of a yet-unnamed military R&D project, the only details of which thus far hint at a weapon of great tactical importance."

"You WERE one to flaunt decorum in the academy," she quietly admitted, "but that might've worked in your favour, Lillie. I mean, Lady Protectress of Manehattan. That's just incredible!"\n"Hah, I wish that was the case. But no, Ocellus," Lilac said, suddenly serious, "it's taken me a lot of manoeuvring and effort to get where I am, and now that I'm actually in charge of Manehattan, my survival is more precarious than its ever been." She walked to her desk. "This is a dangerous job, and I'm seriously lacking trustworthy staffers."\nOcellus listened quietly, waiting for a follow-up. When none came, she hummed in thought. "I er, I don't see why you called me here, Lilac. I'm just an Oberleutnant, a-and I see what you want me for, don't get me wrong!" Ocellus said, raising a placating hoof, "but I don't see how you can get the higherups to—"\n"You leave them to me," Lilac interrupted, gaining an edge to her voice, before sighing softly. "Occie, I need 'lings like you. I remember when you were having trouble just issuing hard orders to the infantry back at the academy. You were doing the 'wrong' thing for the right reason: compassion."\nThe lieutenant said nothing at first, only adjusting her cap in response.

We're facing a different challenge here, and our enemy is completely different from what we've faced before."\nThere was a long, awkward pause. A sigh escaped the elder drone's lips. "I know you, Ocellus. They may have taught you to suppress that part of you when out in the field, but I need you to forget all of that. Please," she added pleadingly, "if you want to help prevent another outbreak of hostilities, please consider my offer."\nOcellus considered this, looking downwards at nothing in particular. When she piped up again, Ocellus said, "You still haven't properly answered my question: how do you intend to induct me into your administration?"\n"Remember when you mentioned that your father Seta he was a bit of a wandering bug before you were born?" Lilac asked, leaning back into her seat. When Ocellus nodded hesitantly, Lilac's grin turned predatory. "Well, he and I had a relationship, Occie."\n"What?!" Ocellus immediately exclaimed, disbelieving.\n"It's true! I didn't say anything back then because it would've been awkward, plus, it didn't last for long." Lilac sighed softly, thinking back fondly at a memory of hers.\nOcellus's eyes widened as she began to understand. "You mean...?"\nLilac's toothy grin only grew. "Technically, dear Ocellus, I am your mother-in-law," she said with a hint of pride. "With some creative application of bureaucracy, I can have this officiated, and register it as fact. Thus, I can claim a familial grant for your position." Then, her expression grew serious again. "As I asked before, Ocellus, I want you to think over my offer seriously. What do you say?"\nOcellus did consider it over a long while. Just when Lilac was beginning to lose hope, the lieutenant brought a hoof to a salute and renewed her stance.

MAN_ELF.72.t:0 "Changeling Dispatches - Patrolling the Everfree"
MAN_ELF.72.d:0 "Beyond the outskirts of Ponyville lies the Everfree Forest. Densely packed with ancient, gnarled trees hundreds of years old, in many places the undergrowth is nigh-impenetrable, leaving travellers only with the few paths through the forest that somehow manage to stay clear of foliage. The deeper one plunges into its depths, the more otherworldly the forest seems as civilisation recedes; the sun fails to pierce the opaque canopies, the treeroots on the forest floor grow so contorted it is hard not to trip, and the flora becomes so exotic and wild to be undomesticable even through earth pony magic. The shadows become thick and foreboding, and the pervading gloom makes it hard to see past a few meters. One can easily imagine getting lost in the murk, doomed to wander the forest until the end of time.\nNo wonder, then, that Zecora's Everfree Resistance had managed to survive as long as it did within. Not so long ago, their bloody and short-lived insurrection had surged to encompass the surrounding towns, threatening Canterlot before being forced back into the forest from whence they came. But the Everfree Resistance seemed to have an unnatural affinity with the woods of their namesake, and the Changeling divisions bled ten times as heavily clearing the forest as they did its surrounds.\nBut with the brute force of sheer firepower, they had managed. They burnt the trees until there were none left for the ponies to hide behind. Artillery barrages cut swathes through the undergrowth. And they had deployed so many tons of defoliant that even the Everfree began to sag under the poisonous onslaught. As the forest burned, Zecora's insurrection withered away until there was nothing left.\nAt least, this was the official narrative. But patrols through the forest still went missing from time to time, and already the Everfree was recovering rapidly from the damage wrought by the Changeling invasion. To be sent to this particular frontier was tantamount to a penal assignment, and everypony knew it."

Her aunt's apologetic demeanor suggested otherwise, implying, with a thinly-veiled rage, that higher powers in Vesalipolis had a hoof in her newest assignment.\nWas she merely a pawn in Lilac's power plays, then? Perhaps her assignment to such a dangerous posting was designed to punish her aunt for some esoteric transgression against the elites in Vesalipolis.\nFor now, it didn't matter. The front of the column has paused at some unseen obstacle. Ocellus glimpses shadowy figures flitting from tree to tree, and the murky depths of the forest begin to shift with the movements of creatures unknown. Behind her, there is an unfolding of blades as her troops affix bayonets. Ocellus pauses, and tries to gauge the nature of their soon-to-be assailants."

Ocellus directs her column's fire onto the charging timberwolves with unwavering precision, until the creatures are all dead or routed."

Past her smoking pistol she makes out the corpse of her unlucky target, falling to the ground. But there are too many of them, and the forest is the ponies' domain. They make a brave last stand at the base of a great oak tree, and their final remnants are at last cut down where they stand by unseen pony snipers.\nOcellus, somehow, evades the pony partisans who are butchering her soldiers, and flees into the depths of the Everfree."

It was supposed to be just a publicity bit, showing the troops that their leaders understood the view from below. But the partisans of the Everfree Resistance had hit hard them in the woods, and after bullets had sliced through her wings she had tumbled down into this ravine. And then the timberwolves came.\nThis one had been unlucky. When she'd killed one of its companions with a few well placed shots, the rest had fallen back, and this lone creature had lost its footing. Now it was hungry, and its presence was keeping her trapped here more surely than her broken wings.\nShe tried scaring it, and then ignoring it, and lastly, out of a kind of lonely grace, she offered the creature some of her rations.\nWhen the reinforcements finally found her two days later, that wolf was already hers."

MAN_ELF.75.d:0 "CLASSIFIED REPORT TO PROTECTRESS LILAC\nWhile acquiring the requested information has been an extremely difficult task due to the secretive nature of the organizations in question, the operation has been a success, and the information about the most notable and prominent secret societies operating within the [MAN.GetName] has been compiled in the dossier accompanying this message.\nHowever, if a short summary is required, it will be presented here. The most notable groups present within the territories under our control are as follows: the "Order of Discordant Chaos", the "Sol Invictas Cult" and "Disciples of Nightmare Moon". Though working towards radically different ends, the means employed by these groups are similar, as all of them desire the triumph of their ideology and/or faith over Equestria. Of course, they posses many differences: the Cult and the Disciples both desire a strong and united Equestria, however, the main difference is in the leanings of faith as, as seen in the names, they worship divinities of sun and moon respectively. Another difference is that among the nightmare cultists there is a great number of rural bats, which does give them an advantage in the countryside. However, this means that if their Chapterhouses in the cities are lost, the group would be left without a leadership. The Cult is an inverse, with a great amount of their members being unicorn urbanites. The order is the strangest of these groups as while we have discovered their Chapterhouses, how influential they are in the society and even their military capabilities in potential engagements, their ideological beliefs and goals are still somewhat of a mystery.\nWhile of course, with the data known to us, it seems that if we crack down on these groups with force, they would not be a threat or dangerous in any way, they also seem to be far more pragmatic and mentally able than most of would be anti-state movements. Thus, while potentially we can easily snuff them out, maybe trying to negotiate with these secret societies would be a better and more beneficial solution."

Even the somewhat luxurious or exotic clothing the leaders of these secret societies wore weren't something that impressive by itself, and it didn't help that most of these stallions and mares were rather elderly and seemingly lacking in spirit and devotion. But that was to be expected, considering they accepted the idea of negotiations for an alliance, something a true idealist or fanatic would never do.\nThe following conversation didn't help as these great leaders and manipulators who have been, allegedly, conspiring behind the scenes to create their own "New World Order", very quickly yielded when confronted with the fact that Lilac and the Ost-Kommando were fully aware of their capabilities, hideouts and spheres of influence, and could snuff them out in an instant. Confronted with their own insignificance, the deal that Lilac proposed was quickly agreed upon, and the Lady Protectress was soon initiated as a honourary member of these secret societies."

Today's mass arrests, with over three thousand ponies incarcerated, are part of the Changeling Administration's efforts to root out "undesirable" and "subversive" elements, which have been intensified with the formation of the Bilateral Commission, alongside the Lady Protectress' recent initiatives to achieve a higher degree of autonomy for Manehattan.

The island's real value lies with its strategic geopolitical location, with the potential of serving as the staging point for an invasion of Griffonia.\nLilac and the Ost-Kommando are under no illusions as to the Griffish Isle's military value. To acquire the island would be a boon to Manehattan's power, at least on paper, anyways.\nVesalipolis is fully cognisant of the fragility of their rule over the occupied territories of Equestria, and should be receptive towards our proposal to take the burden of administering the Griffish Isle off their hooves.

Give them a cause or a warm, happy memory and they'll cling to it until the bitter end.\nIn this case, deliverance from the Changeling jackboot comes in the form of their unassailable Princess-Mother, her chaste, maternal demeanor and the profundity of her mystical powers combined in a paragon of Equestrian divinity — the pinnacle of everything a pony wants to become. That the sun still rises and sets without her guidance is immaterial to the ponies' worship of the Solar Goddess, which, if anything, has intensified under the new Changeling regime.\nSo long as they remember her, Celestia's very memory and existence will certainly continue to motivate them to insubordination and in time, open revolt. Lilac's new initiatives to 'educate' the populace about their old leaders' many faults may not always be factual, and the process of indoctrination will require much time and effort, but she has no doubt that it will be beneficial to the legitimacy of the new regime with time.\nManehattan's schools now teach young foals and changelings about Celestia the tyrant, greedy, stubborn, and myopic, a lazy delegator who pursued luxury whilst other ponies did all the work.

We are going to need to do better if we are to chip away at Celestia's personality cult.\nLilac's aides have proposed two alternatives to the initial plan. First of all, we could target the most controversial aspect of Celestia's reign: the undemocratic nature of the harmonic regime. It was something fringe republican movements had been complaining about for ages. We could use this to paint Celestia as a power-hungry tyrant who suppressed dissenters to preserve her autocratic rule.\nThere is, of course, another option. Equestria under the Diarchs was notably pacifistic, resulting in a weak military using outdated technology, something analysts often point to as one of the major causes for Equestria's defeat in the Great War. We could attack Celestia on her peaceful ways, describing them as cowardice that left the ponies undefended and helpless, while implying the Changelings' superior military would defend them from harm.\nHowever, some of Lilac's aides believe Celestia's reputation to be pristine to the point that any attempt to tarnish it would backfire, and have instead suggested dropping the initiative as quietly as possible with the hope that nopony will notice."

We need to roll back this initiative before it causes backlash.

Furthermore, some of the more imaginative aides even suggested vilifying Daybreaker by comparing her to the old gods that used to be worshipped by the inhabitants of the southern jungles; ancient and brutal gods, who had demanded blood sacrifices of their enemies. And it just so happens that such divinities are associated with the sun.\nOf course even with such a plan, it might turn out that the ponies are simply too zealous to change their beliefs, even in the face of such arguments.

Although the group is made up of renowned industrialists, owners of private banks and otherwise unbelievably rich ponies, they all seem dazzled by the luxury on display. Crystal chandeliers dot the finely painted ceiling, exquisite furniture decorates every corner, and a large display case full of meticulously crafted and very fragile glasses and various alcoholic beverages dominates the room. From the penthouse's numerous windows and balconies, one can see the entirety of Manehattan, its lights providing an awe-inspiring view - this is the highest spot in the entire city.\nThe changeling general staff is already seated when the guests arrive and Lady Lilac rises in welcome to shake hooves with the ponies. The servants are hard at work, and soon enough, dinner is ready, washed down by the finest wine. Lady Lilac thoroughly entertains her guests throughout the evening by utilising her transformation magic to startle and impress. Mixed in is talk of business dealings - Lady Lilac has secured at least one major contract by the end of the night - as well as the gathering of... sensitive information, should it be required down the line. Overall, it was all in all a successful and profitable evening.\nWhen all is said and done, Lilac's general staff advises her to institutionalise the "court" as a sort of formal advisory council to increase her regime's legitimacy and control over Manehattan society through keeping its elites on her side.\nHowever, Lady Lilac is now pondering another idea. In her ambition, she wants to take inspiration from the open court sessions from Celestia's rule, open to everypony who had an issue to take up with her.

Just how many ponies had the free time to bother her with the most unbelievably mundane issues one could imagine? Leaky pipes, troublesome neighbours... lost keys! At this point Lilac felt very sorry for Celestia who had to put up with this madness daily for more than a thousand years.\nThe next petitioner approaches her, but instead of belting out another 20-minute long tirade about \"noise pollution\" and \"clean water\", she pulls out a pistol from some hidden pocket in her gown.

The pony is dead before she even hits the floor.\nAs is natural, the incident cuts the session short as guards escort the panicked ponies outside. Lilac stares out a window into the city outside, still trembling lightly. Had the guards been just one second late to react...\nBut strangely, she also felt relieved to be free of her boredom. The botched assassination attempt had been an episode of much-needed excitement in an otherwise tedious day, and the nonchalance with which she took it in stride concerned herself. The whole salon idea might have been a mistake after all. The sessions were grating on her mental health to the point where nearly getting killed seemed like an improvement. Maybe it's best to cut her losses and dissolve the court for good?"

The Lady Protectress has reportedly dissolved her court during its seventh session! Everything seemed under control until an elderly pony petitioner approached her and kept mishearing Lady Lilac's replies. Two minutes into the petition, Lady Lilac flew into a rage, wailing loudly as she unleashed a magical assault on the penthouse's grandfather clock which left it reduced to ashes. She then declared, in tears, that every pony in the room was insane, that she was \"done with all these vapid, whiny petitions\" and that the court was hereby permanently dissolved. She then ordered the arrest of everypony who had contributed to her stress throughout the sessions - which she apparently had made a list for."

MAN_ELF.93.d:0 "The secret to success lay not in one grand move, but in a thousand little cuts that each brought you closer to your goal. One dossier among a thousand passing through the bureaucracy and being stamped by an overworked clerk could still be caught if it held everything what was planned.\nTherefore one dossier would talk at insufferable length about the minutiae of bureaucratic restructuring planned in Manehattan, none of it even relevant. Another mentioned how certain postings would be reworked into new offices. The third would describe another restructuring, not mentioning that this left most of those positions sinecures - appointments with neither influence nor responsibilities. Unless one knew what to look for, none would be able to see what was going on, yet in the heart of Manehattan sat the one who truly knew everything.\nReviewing another file, she made a note to review the chamber of commerce. There was an overly nosy director there, and he was a little too devoted to Vesalipolis. Thankfully, his performance was good enough that a promotion was in order. A posting overseeing the economic development of Cloudy Hills, maybe? He would no doubt be very effective managing the countryside.\nThus is went on every little change switched the pieces on the board just a little. A small nudge here, a controversial but justifiable dismissal there, a bureaucratic overhaul here, a promotion to a useless position there. Of course the gaps and the new positions that arose needed to be filled, and it was fortunate that there were so many capable Manehattanites available. They were, perhaps, not QUITE as loyal to Vesalipolis as the ones they had replaced, which was a potential issue... only not for Lilac or Manehattan."

Now that Lilac has managed to cement the Changeling presence in the city of Manehattan and its satellites, however, the elimination of the Fillydelphia and Albion resistance organisations has become the next objective of paramount importance for the Garrison.\nFor the past few weeks, Changeling agents undercover in pony guises have infiltrated the respective organisations of the two restive cities, keeping tabs on the actions and whereabouts of the most prominent Resistance leaders. Having been allowed to flourish, these organisations proved more resistant to infiltration, with several infiltrators being uncovered and subsequently lost, but shielded by the intensification of policing and reprisal actions by local garrisons, the operatives largely succeeded in revealing the identities of the surviving leadership of the Resistance."

MAN_ELF.95.d:0 "Prior to the Great War, the anti-establishment philosopher known as "Hoofdrich Chryzsche" was a figure notorious for his radical anti-monarchist views and contrarian attitude, but not much else. Equestria's defeat and the subsequent Changeling occupation seemed to revitalise his fiery rhetoric, however, as dissident ponies living under the new Changeling regime found themselves in need of an iconic figurehead to rally around, and the eccentric, populist Hoofdrich was the ideal character to play the role.\nTo any critically-minded observer, the fact that he had been allowed to remain a vocal but outspoken opposition figure under the Protectress Lilac's rule, even whilst the real subversives of the Harmonic Resistance were being hunted relentlessly, seemed like an obvious indictment of his relative harmlessness in the grand scheme of things - a conveniently defanged talking head to satisfy the appetites of milquetoast dissidents.\nIn the end, though, whether Hoofdrich's contrarian philosophy was of any real substance became immaterial to his image. Found dead this morning at his penthouse apartment on Manehattan's Bridleway, his corpse was still warm when the mainstream dissident newspapers, accusing the Changeling regime of having assassinated the philosopher, called for a general strike and street demonstrations in his memory."

MAN_ELF_new.950.d:0 "Though the economic impact made by those in the workforce who had struck was decidedly minimal, by dusk there was a large congregation of ponies in downtown Bronclyn's Central Park holding vigil around a makeshift shrine for Hoofdrich, now having become a martyr of the Resistance. Nightfall saw groups of armed ponies descend on the park, forcing out the Constabulary present and erecting hasty barricades around their martyr's shrine. The flag of the [MAN.GetName] flying above the park's central plaza was torn down, symbolically defaced, and burnt, with the Equestrian royal banner raised in its place.\nEven then, such blatant dissent was no cause for concern to the Ost-Kommando. At daybreak, the massed ranks of Changeling troops and their Constabulary auxiliaries stationed around the park's perimeter would prepare their assault on the barricades. Panzers and artillery pieces would be brought up via the Maneway, and collaborationist scouts would erode the boundaries of the Resistance-occupied parkland. The encircled ponies readied their rifles and prepared to make a grim last stand around Hoofdrich's Shrine.\nAt least, this was how things were supposed to go. Instead, the few companies of Changeling soldiers around the park found themselves surrounded by massive crowds of restive ponies, drawn there by the news of an impending massacre of Resistance. The armoured reinforcements never arrived because the Maneway rails had been sabotaged overnight, and the collaborationists, upon seeing the swelling and increasingly angry masses of Manehattanites who had shown up in opposition, simply melted away.\nThe situation is quickly getting out of hoof as Fillydelphia and Albion convulse in sympathy riots, and if Manehattan is not pacified soon the rest of the Harmonic Resistance may well decide to further escalate the situation. Masked rioters battle with Constabulary and Changeling soldiers all over the city, and the population grows more restless by the minute.

The Protectress Lilac, clad in body armour and surrounded by a retinue of jaegers, was seen directing crowd dispersal operations across the metropolis. A source within the Constabulary credits the Protectress with the relatively low casualty rate, saying that "the Protectress being on site was the best thing that could've happened.

By dawn, the worst of the civil unrest seems to have been neutralised, though hundreds of casualties are suspected, many of whom were citizens or otherwise peaceful demonstrators.

MAN_ELF.101.d:0 "There was an odd sense of calm in Lilac's office at the Crystaller Building. That wasn't to say that there was nothing for her to do; there were still reports to peruse, orders to approve, and certificates to issue. However, unlike in the past months, there was nothing that urgently required her attention. For once, Lilac could stop and think over what she and her staff had managed to accomplish.\nManehattan was once more a symbol of stability and prosperity, a sign of efficient and creative changeling administration that had brought to heel the dissenters, the naysayers, and the troublemakers. Ponies didn't hurl insults or worse at patrolling soldiers anymore. In some cases, they were welcoming changelings into their shops, their restaurants, even in their homes! Who could have ever thought that such a thing would've been possible a year back?\nIt wasn't just limited to the capital either: Fillydelphia, Trottingham, Prance, Albion, Detrot... even the rural countryside, such as Hollow Shades, experienced a renewed economy and a peace that looked to last. Lilac, the Lady Protectress of the Manehattan Protectorate, had finally achieved her goals. The Queen's court back at Vesalipolis was pleased, the collaborators were fully cooperative, and the resistance was pacified.\nBut then, why did Lilac feel that she wasn't yet done?\nOf course, there was still the rather trivial day-to-day matters of running the Protectorate, but it was just that: trivial. The Protectorate had a flourishing economy, a burgeoning industry, and a respectably powerful military. Would it always remain a state subservient to the Vesalipolis Court, to eventually be annexed directly? Or could it be something more?\nThe former was the obvious choice. Lilac hadn't gotten this far without having kissed flank of those superior to her, and she'd still achieved fame and renown for her efforts. She'd be celebrated back home and see a comfortable retirement after she saw the Protectorate through under Vesalipolis. It was the easy option.\nOr perhaps, she could go beyond her mandate. Lilac had proven her shrewdness in the face of challenges that would've broken lesser changelings. She was a capable military leader and governor; therefore, it stood to reason that she'd prove to be a capable civilian leader. Besides, she had gambled against Chrysalis and walked away victorious before. Lilac was sure that she could do it again.\nThe ponies and changelings of the Protectorate were, of course, changing. And perhaps, it was finally time that Lilac took the path towards freedom for all of her citizens: changelings AND ponies."

Many local Manehattians watched in amusement as a group of the new arrivals bathed in the bay's waters. When asked why they had done so, a drone replied: "Back home, outdoors bathing is unthinkable. There's something about diving into a large pool of water, and a bathtub just doesn't cut it."\nAnother drone was impressed at the efficiency of the Weather Service and applauded the climate. "Sunny skies, warm weather, and just an overall great place to be in," she said, adding jokingly that their old homes could make use of similar services. "There are a lot of bugs back home who are more than a little stir-crazy.

I owe much of my success to them.\n"But Manehattan cannot sit under the supervision of Ost-Kommando and Vesalipolis. With them so far away, it only stands to reason that our lands must employ self-rule through a civilian administration. It is the only scenario where I can see a thriving society of changelings AND ponies.\n"I've been practising for the announcement tomorrow, and I hope that everyone involved will see what I am striving for.

MAN_ELF.105.d:0 "Even during the great war, life for Pearl Rain was relatively normal. Manehatten, despite its industrial power and population, had been spared the worst horrors of the Great War, being on the completely opposite side of the continent. Stallions and mares went off to fight, and workloads did increase to meet necessity - that was true. But somehow, a sense of normalcy, and even stability, pervaded life in the East.\nWhen the news of the Equestrian capitulation came, she denied it, as did many other Manehattanites. It simply sounded absurd - how could Equestria yield and break? The Cradle of Ponykind, guarded by its eternal alicorn diarchs... And yet, changeling forces were marching through the streets, ponies were being rounded up at gunpoint, and suddenly Manehattan had become a city under occupation.\nThis initial denial turned into anger towards the occupiers, as ponies of Manehatten rose up in their thousands, spurred on by the remnants of Equestrian army units that still held out across the metropolis. They tried fighting the changelings in the streets, hoping that they could retake the city for Equestria which had to still be fighting. This hope was crushed with overwhelming force. Many were killed, but even the changeling jaegers couldn't hunt them out or kill that many. If one spent time with the survivors for the next few weeks, they would notice talk about how different things could have been if certain actions were taken, or how different things would be the next time. Pearl Rain was one of these ponies, hoping that there would be another chance, yet another attempt, that their leaders would return and bring them freedom.\nOf course, most of those who went out to fight never returned. And the voices of dissent became hushed, as the revolutionary fervor and dreams ran out. Only darkness and emptiness was left in this world which didn't make sense anymore. Evil and disharmony was triumphant, as light was pushed back and crushed, trapped behind the seas at best.\nEventually, even the emptiness inside faded, as Pearl Rain fully accepted the new situation. After all, it would be stupid to be stuck in the past, nursing absurd dreams of harmony triumphant. Equestria might be consumed by darkness, but it things could be worse. And maybe with some effort, through hard work, she can make life just a little bit better for others. After all, no matter what happened or happens..."

"They are love-infused candies made in cooperation with the locals. It is a little wasteful perhaps, but I just adore them."

"It is something you learn over time: Manehattan is a marvellous place that holds potential that I do not think one can even find back in the old country. Just these little trifles," she said, picking up one of the Lovebites and biting down on it. "I am such a glutton for them, but that's what we do here in Manehattan. We take the best and elevate it.

For one, the [MAN.GetAdjective] military has diversified and improved on their doctrine and equipment, now featuring pony units as well as cutting-edge ordnance on display, with one analyst remarking that the subtle signs of supply shortages and inexperience from the first parade were absent. Most importantly, the ponies in attendance this time around did so in greater numbers and in higher spirits - perhaps as a sign of a growing acceptance of the Pax Chrysalia amongst the local populace. No violent incidents occured other than some occasional foalish hooliganism and heckling, reflecting a growing tendency for the authorities to allow disgruntled ponies to engage in petty dissent as part of their development into mature citizens. Of course, most of the bystanders were usually much more measured in their conduct, at worst abstaining from the event and staying home. In light of the successful efforts to return peace and prosperity to the metropolis, the not-unpositive reception to this parade presents evidence that the ponies are becoming increasingly content with the new regime."

Belonging to the Canterlot class of Equestrian battleships, both vessels are considered antiquated relative to contemporary designs, but the proximity of their wrecks to the megalopolis and the relative ease of recovery which this entailed made them the target of the Ost-Kommando's naval reclamation efforts.\nWith a startling efficiency the Großstadt Manehattan had been towed from its resting place on the shore to the dockyards of Manehattan, where it had been repaired, refitted, and recrewed, to sail the oceans once more under the flag of the Changeling Hegemony. On the other hoof, the Dame Protektorin was returned to its drydock immediately after the naval review, where work on renovating its armament and superstructure continued; a barren hulk still algae-coated and battered from being refloated scant days ago, it had barely managed to stay afloat during the naval review.\nAs symbols of bygone Equestrian naval might, the resurrection of these two battleships call into question the aspirations of Manehattan's Changeling administration."

Lilac, the Protectress herself, strolls here and there chatting like any Manehattan socialite host. She flatters and teases, confusing and honestly frightening the cowed rich ponies. But all agree afterwards that she is nothing if not a stellar hostess, and beautiful no matter what her form.\nAs a parlor trick, notably, Lilac shifts many times that night. She mirrors baffled magnates and delights patronized artists with her impressions. Some are so impressed that they almost forget the armed guards.

MAN_ELF.114.d:0 "Under the aegis of the Dominion's monolithic military-industrial complex, backed by an abundance of research subsidies and massive injections of capital into the state-controlled economy, Manehattan's science sector flourishes before the dawn of a new golden age.\nFrom the city's laboratories and R&D firms comes a veritable outpour of brilliant and numinous magitech, the finest that can be found in the world, wondrous amalgamations of magic, science, engineering, and technology finding their way onto the shelves of upmarket hardware shops and technomagic emporiums.\nWithin the classrooms of the supercity's most prestigious schools, the scions of wealth and privilege learn the ropes of power through means unorthodox as they are exorbitant - via psychic styluses that imprint onto paper words as soon as they are conceived in the mind of the thinker, and enchanted hardback tomes that accomodate the knowledge of a million books within their fluctuating, etheral pages.\nThe dandy spellslingers of Manehattan's avant-garde underworld steal or counterfeit the magitech wands preloaded with unicorn incantations, and the affluent retired enjoy the ministrations of tireless golems, clay in the form of ponies and other creatures brought to un-life through the marriage of magic and artistry.\nPast the suburban sprawl of Hayston, out in the western hinterlands of the megalopolis, on soil already become diseased and poisoned, the gears of industry and progress turn harder than ever, spurred on by the promises of economic prosperity and neverending magic-fueled growth. The shimmering filth that emerges from the smokestacks come in all the colours of the rainbow, rising above the landscape to blot out the sun. The pinnacles of the skyscraper-factories rival those of Canterlot in their ambition to pierce the heavens, shrouding in shadow the abject misery of the labour camps and sweatshops below.\nEven after nightfall, long past twilight, the foundries where magic is caged and remoulded with such brutal efficiency continue on with their ceaseless activity, their wan emanations lighting up the night sky with the glow of an eternal sunset."

Electricity crackles ominously around the brooding thunderclouds, then there is a blinding flash of light as a jagged spear of lighting - pure energy in its most primal form - lances down from the stratosphere to touch upon a distant spot on the horizon.\nIts target, the decrepit hulk of a wrecked Equestrian battleship several kilometers out to sea, erupts in a magnificent fireball, wowing everypony present.\nImpressive though its destructive potential may be, the Lightning Coil in its current form is not ready for the battlefield, but it is only the first of the many technological marvels to come forth from the laboratories of Lilac's Dominion."

Dozens of times, he had made the journey through the different zones of occupation on the road from to Manehattan to Canterlot, ferrying messages and whatnot for the Resistance. The soldiers at the checkpoints would check his counterfeited papers, find nothing out of the ordinary, give the back of his van a perfunctory glance, and so he would move on. The thrill of trepidation and danger from his illicit smuggling trips had long since given way to a sense of dullness.\nSo why did he feel so worried, now?\nThen the officer was leaning through the window into the driver's cab, and he was hoofing over his sheaf of identification documents, and he had got out of the van and was going to open the back up for the customary inspection when he felt the rifle butt smash into the back of his head. A figure leaned over him as he felt the muzzle of a pistol press against his temple.\n"The devil's in the details, liebchen. The Provisional Bureau for Transport hasn't been in operation for months.

Having served in the Equestrian Royal Navy during the Great War, the sailor-turned-pirate has now been confirmed to be working with the Harmonic Resistance, attacking Changeling shipping off the Equestrian East Coast.\nRecent naval reforms undertaken by the Changeling military administration of the Manehattan Protectorate would prove to be the downfall of this notorious pirate. Recently outfitted with steel belt armour, the Terpsichoria was able to withstand the opening salvo from the attacking skiffs, and through skillful use of its shipboard ordnance, was able to sink or disable at least three pirate vessels, routing the remainder. In a devious boarding action undertaken by the Terpsichoria's small complement of jaegers, Turquoise Breeze was captured alive aboard the wreckage of his flagship and taken into Changeling custody, along with an operative of the Harmonic Resistance.\nSpeaking to the press, the Chief of Navy of the [MAN.GetName], [MAN_scripted_loc_for_chief_of_navy], proclaimed the demise of piracy in Manehattanite waters, and reiterated the Changeling administration's commitment to combatting the Harmonic Resistance's illegal activities, wherever they may be."

MAN_ELF.118.d:0 "In the shade of the Bronclyn Bridge, crowds of ponies throng the Mare-de-Sun Square Garden, waving banners and placards and chanting anti-Changeling slogans. Unannounced by the mainstream opposition groups and seemingly unnoticed by the Changeling administration's network of collaborationist informants, the spontaneous protest had, in a rare outmaneuvering of Lilac's MO-oPS, succeeded in catching the Garrison's security apparatus completely off guard. Because the Constabulary is as inefficient as ever, we have had to rely on our own infiltrators, performing impromptu transformations into random passersby as a consequence of their rushed deployment, to gather intelligence on this sudden outpouring of unrest.\nWithin the ranks of the dissenters, their purpose becomes readily evident: they have occupied the construction sites around the structs of the Bronclyn Bridge, damaging and sabotaging equipment in an apparent bid to stymie our reconstruction efforts. The destruction is chaotic and unorganised, and there is some conflict between differing factions within the dissidents as to their methodology, but the damage already being done is significant - a strain on our finances and resources, and another blow to the legitimacy of Changeling rule over the East Coast.\nThe flurry of activity within the Crystaller Building, provoked by the nasty shock of the Harmonic Resistance's sudden strike, is frenetic and tinged with hysteria. It did not help that the collaborationist staff were especially susceptible to the panic, on account of them being ponies.\nAcross the city, the local changeling commander stationed at the Bronclyn Bridge has his own plans, as the occupation of the Square entered into its third hour. On his own initiative, in an excellent embodiment of the Changeling military tradition which emphasises snap decisionmaking and mission-type tactics, the company of soldiers under his command took up positions within the buildings surrounding the Mare-de-Sun Square Garden, and began firing volleys of tear-gas to disperse the rabble. The speediness and shock of the changeling response broke the resolve of the ponies and sent them all running, in a surprising and complete rout.\nUpon hearing the news, the Ost-Kommando amassed before the doors of Lilac's bedroom all breathe out a collective sigh of relief. The Lady Protectress was having her daily nap, and everyling knew how worked up she could get if she got woken up, especially to deal with random crises."

What if she could recruit some of the hardened thugs of Manehattan to supplement her Garrison?\nThe answer to that question lay before the eyes of the exhausted Changeling recruiters - and it was far from pretty. A thousand ex-criminal ponies, all in varying stages of decrepitness, already becoming rowdy well before their first assignment. Training this rabble would be an absolute waste of time.

Bankers, industrialists and nobles - incidentally, a large number proportion of them Changeling collaborators, all seated at the tables of one of the fanciest venues in the entire continent, engaged in pleasantries and fine dining.\nAll seemed to be going well right up until the end of the second course. As if on cue, a contingent of the Ost-Kommando's shocktroopers, in full Changeling uniform and bearing the Protectorate's insignia, crashed through the doors of the main entrance to the dining hall, tearing the doors off their hinges. Before anyone even realised what was happening, the Changelings began assaulting the attendants of the event and ransacking the finely decorated hall, all the while hurling abuse at the collaborators, calling them "useless equinoids" and other assorted slurs. By the end of the attack, the venue had been utterly trashed and the ponies had fled into the night.\nIt has always been an open secret that the Changeling administration held a certain amount of disdain for the collaborationist establishment in Manehattan, but never had such a violent incident occured before. The Ost-Kommando released a statement condemning the attack and denying responsibility but no actions were taken against the attackers, despite the ample evidence that they were members of the Protectorate's Garrison. This has been taken as a sign that the Lady Protectress has revoked the collaborators' protected status, as evidenced by new reports that the ELF's funds have tripled since the incident."

Every surface seems covered in barbed wire, fearsome anti-air cannons are mounted on the guard towers, and there are rumours that Diamond Dog jailors have been brought over from Griffonia to bolster the prison's defences.\nAll these preventative measures designed to counter a breakout, fearsome as they are, now seem trifling in the face of the Harmonic Resistance's most audacious feat of defiance yet - a direct assault on the Penitentiary, to rescue their commander Firefly from the bowels of the prison. A series of well-placed explosions brought down the fortified front gates, after which pony partisans stormed the prison, surprising the guards and taking control over most of the facility.\nThe surviving guards are now barricaded within a secure section of the facility with access to a pier, from which reinforcements can be inserted. A company of jaegers, backed up by a platoon or so of Constabulary officers, are now ready to reenter the Penitentiary to disrupt the Resistance operation. Firefly's cell has been blown open, and the renegade commander with his coterie of partisans are fighting his way out of a cordon of changeling guards as we speak.\nThe Harmonic Resistance rearguard defending the approaches to the prison may have had the element of surprise at first, but they are lightly-armed and will not stand up to a concerted push; whilst their commander may escape, we can make sure that it will cost the ponies dearly. On the other hoof, we might still be able to recapture Firefly before he makes good his escape, if we work fast enough. What shall it be?"

The rebel general Firefly had escaped, but Lilac felt a grim sort of satisfaction towards the price the Harmonic Resistance had paid for his freedom. At least two dozen ponies had been confirmed killed, amongst them a few fighters notorious enough to be considered high-level targets. Scores more had been captured alive, most of them part of the doomed rearguard which had stayed behind to cover Firefly's escape. Lilac watches until the last of the prisoners are loaded onto the back of trucks, and carted away.\nBack at the Crystaller Building, Lilac reads the MO-oPS after-action report. A select few paragraphs of information pique her interest: infiltrators in deep cover within the ranks of the ponies are reporting rumours of a Changeling trap designed to make the Resistance bleed, and that Firefly had not been worth the lives of their comrades, or even that the pony they had freed was in fact a changeling decoy, and the Diarchs had hushed up the revelation to protect morale. Lilac felt a little better after that; all things considered, her earlier decision-making had ended up paying dividends after all."

By nightfall, everypony in the room has already come to accept the inevitable conclusion: that Firefly had successfully escaped to freedom.\nOn the ride back to the Crystaller, Lilac watches the world passing by outside the car window, as they pass through roadblocks and checkpoints slowly being dismantled in the wake of their failure. Opposite her sits Tantalus, the commander of the Queen's Guard assigned to Manehattan. He speaks first: "Who shall the MO-oPS indict for the failure of the operation? You know Vesalipolis will come asking for an explanation, and then heads will roll. It is better that the MO-oPS finds a scapegoat before my colleagues from the homeland set about the task with their usual, ah, zeal."\nWith the last part of that sentence he at least has the good grace to look apologetic. There are a few minutes before Lilac responds: "Firefly's escape was an unfortunate stroke of bad luck for my jaegers. It would be unreasonable to attribute the responsibility for this setback to one individual."\n"You realise that this will reach the ears of the Queen herself, yes?"\n"I think I can suffer through a few days' worth of angry telegrams." At this, Tantalus snorts. "You know you're crazy, right? Chrysalis will have your scalp if she gets wind of your little autonomy project, Lilac."\nFor a while, they are silent, until Lilac speaks up: "That's just a risk I'm going to have to take, I suppose.

All officers of the Ost-Kommando were ordered to attend.\nApproval of Agenda: The agenda was unanimously approved as presented.\nAfter numerous failed attempts at pacifying Manehattan, the Ost-Kommando's agenda has been lagging behind for months, stunting the growth of the collaborator apparatus and leaving the garrisons weakened, with the E.L.F. growing stronger by the day. The final of a series of proposals in the meeting was presented by Lady Lilac herself - a comprehensive plan to flush out the resistance by provoking the ponies into rising up on our terms. The plan includes a number of components: conducting false flag attacks, infiltrating the E.L.F. and ensuring an advantage in the premature rebellion. The plan is highly risky and it could end in disaster for the Ost-Kommando, but Lady Lilac believes there are no other options at this point in time. It is also imperative that the plan remain top secret, as it would be considered high treason by Vesalipolis and would provoke a strong reaction from loyalist officers in the garrisons. To this end, the attendants of the meeting were made to swear a sacred oath of secrecy. The meeting was adjourned and the plan was immediately set in motion."

As I was saying, that sounds good and all, but if the plan is to force the ponies' hoof, then we won't even need to pretend to be them. We can just get our operatives to do the horrible things as themselves, I mean. Since the goal is to make the ponies angry enough to commit to a rushed rebellion, remember?"\n"Aw, I was hoping to get to pretend being a pony again. So you're saying, to achieve our goal, I can just phone up the Garrison and order them to go ham on the pones?"\n"Yea, basically."\nHuh.\nTurns out, inciting a population of rebellious ponies into open revolt — as an oppressive military dictator who everypony hates, remember — might not be that hard after all."

Notably, the Ost-Kommando appears to be using these vulnerable positions as punitive postings for incompetent officers or those overly critical of Lady Lilac's policy - especially those overly loyal to Vesalipolis rather than their duties.

A pony - usually someone no one had ever seen before - rallying the crowds to attack the Changeling checkpoints dotting the Protectorate. The crowd cheered and swarmed around the checkpoint, sieging it with any kitchenware or tool they could get their hooves on, beating Changeling and collaborator alike.

A live news crew captured the incident, and images of the massacre are being broadcast across the Protectorate.

The ELF seems to have fully come out of hiding and is in the process of mobilising its fighters and taking over key areas such as abandoned armouries and military bases, factories, airports and government buildings. Meanwhile, the lack of law enforcement has enabled the lunarist and solarist cults to merge and engage in street fights with each other as ponies settle old scores.

We can attempt to repel the attack on Fillydelphia, which is the more developed city of the two and of more economic importance.

Manehattan was, after all, one of the most valuable prizes of the great war, and it was meant to become one of our most valuable assets.\nAlas, it seems that Lilac has only produced disappointment, and Manehattan is in nigh anarchy. The local security forces have been unable to handle the situation, and in order to avoid the situation from deteriorating further, decisive action is needed. Chrysalis has signed an executive order to seize direct control of the region. Lilac has been relieved of her duties and her services will no longer be needed."

They weren't even going to give her the honour of a discreet dismissal it seemed."\n"Protectress Lilac," the officer said, "By order of Her Majesty Queen Chrysalis, you are hereby relieved of your duties. Corporal Tarsus here will escort you to your residence."\n"Chrysalis moves fast, doesn't she?" Lilac asked. "Very well, let me just clean out my office and I will..."\n"That will not be necessary," the officer said. "Your private possessions will be sent to you. Her Majesty expects you on the train to Vesalipolis within twenty-four hours. She advised that you spend the train trip preparing your defense."\nThe last word sent a chill down Lilac's spine, and she realized what was happening. Chrysalis didn't just want an excuse, she wanted a scapegoat. She had bet on Lilac, and Lilac had let her down, now the price would have to be paid.\nWordlessly, she stood up and let the soldier escort her out of her office. Ten minutes ago she had been the Protectress of Manehattan, yet now? She looked out of the window, studying the city that had been her home for the last years, the city she'd never see again. Now, she was nothing, and Chrysalis asserted her absolute power over all things, as she always had done."

MAN_ELF.138.d:0 "From our remaining contacts in Equestria, through urgent telegrams and other means of communication, come reports of a well-organised revolution bent on overthrowing Changeling rule. The prosperous territories of the East Coast, with its industry and wealth, had been administered under a Protectorate following the Changeling conquest of Equestria, and while their rule had seemed unshakeable for a while, the will of the ponies had not been broken. From the suburbs of Manehattan, the shadowy woods of Hollow Shades, and the inland cities of Detrot and Stratusburg, the Equestrian Liberation Front rises up in open revolt.\nUnable or unwilling to navigate the vastness of the Celestial Sea, and perhaps put off partly by the constant belligerence of our griffon neighbours, Queen Chrysalis has thus far spared the [EQC.GetName] from Changeling expansionism, seemingly content to gorge herself on the riches of Equestria.\nWhether the [EQC.GetName] plans on partaking in the Equestrian liberatory endeavour remains to be seen. For now, the government, whether out of genuine benevolence towards our fellow ponies, or motivated by more cynical impulses, has facilitated the transport of many members of the Equestrian émigré diaspora home to participate in their kin's revolt."

The consequences of our overstretched garrisons are set to be the most dire in the territories of the East Coast of Equestria, far away from the influence of Vesalipolis. A semi-autonomous Protectorate, centered on the metropolis of Manehattan, must be formed as quickly as possible in order to pacify the unrest brewing in the East.\nOur divisions, experienced and battle-hardened as they are, will still be able to maintain some control over the East Coast, but time is running short. Already, we are receiving reports that the rebel organisation known as the Equestrian Liberation Front is mobilising huge swathes of the local population against our rule. If we don't want a full-blown revolution on our hooves, so soon after our hard-earned victory during the Great War, action must be taken soon, and fast."

A semi-autonomous military Protectorate, free to make their own decisions near-instantaneously and without bureaucratic red tape, might have had the versatility to contain the unrest before it became unmanageable. But the Manehattan Protectorate had not been formed, and now, it is too late.\nStarlight Glimmer and Trixie Lulamoon, leaders of the Equestrian Liberation Front, are rallying armies of pony resistance fighters, in which the remnants of regular Royal Equestrian Army units form a formidable backbone.

MAN_ELF_new.331.d:0 "FROM THE MILITARY COMMAND OF THE EASTERN GARRISON TO PROTECTRESS LILAC\nWith great sadness and distress we must inform you, Protectress Lilac, of the extremely problematic and difficult situation which has developed in many areas within the [MAN.GetName]. Countless locations, and in some cases, entire regions, have been overtaken by anti-state and anti-Changeling rebellious sentiment, though in numerous notable cases, well-organised and well-armed militant radicals, operating under the aegis of the Harmonic Resistance, have been encountered.\nDue to our lacking resources and personnel, we were unable to defeat these rebels and terrorist elements, and thus were forced to evacuate Changeling administrative personnel from many of the affected areas. Many attempts at reestablishing formal control over these territories have resulted in failure, as only the most heavily armed and trained troops are capable of entering these locations and emerging unscathed. As always, such personnel is heavily lacking, and thus we cannot attempt to pacify these insurgents.\nWe must also warn you, Protectress, that we are approaching a true breaking point. Whilst most urban areas and very important locations are still under the control of the Garrison, we cannot allow any more territory to fall to the hooves of the Harmonic Resistance if we want to retain long-term strategic military control over the territories of the [MAN.GetName].\nMost troublingly, our infiltrators report that there may be dissent occuring on a much greater scale than the isolated operations of regional Harmonic Resistance cells: the "Equestrian Liberation Front" is suspected to be the preeminent umbrella organisation responsible for overseeing and coordinating all anti-Changeling activity in Eastern Equestria. The prevention of any further territorial losses to the insurgents must be engaged with in full haste to stop the explosive growth such coordinated and armed opposition to our rule.\nPostscript: Relevant attachments detailing current military personnel for both the Garrison, and the estimated military capabilities of the insurgents, are included in the dossier containing this report."

She wasn't Celestia or Twilight, she wasn't even Shining Armor. She was a small-time cult leader who had stumbled flank first into a position she didn't really deserve. And yet here she was, actually leading the uprising?! What was she doing!?\nWhen a splash of ice cold water hit her neck she squealed and all but forgot about her thoughts as she looked angrily towards the culprit. Trixie Lulamoon was standing a couple of meters away, levitating a mug of water back to her mouth before taking a sip.\n"Are you done panicking?" Trixie asked her. Starlight took a deep breath and nodded.\n"For now," she said. "It just sunk in what we are doing. This is Twilight's job, not ours."\n"Well I'm not seeing any of miss Twilight Spaaarkle here, are you?" Trixie said with a smirk forming on her face. "No! You see The Great and Powerful Trixie, and her humble assistant of course." The smile faltered on her face and she put a hoof on Starlight's shoulder. "Now... between you and me? I was wondering yesterday if I should just bolt for the Riverlands. But the show must go on, somehow. So are you ready to go give those bugs the greatest show on Equus?"\n"Let's do this."

MAN_ELF_new.143.d:0 "All over Equestria, from Appleloosa to Vanhoover, a revolutionary calling beckons to those ponies who still stand defiant against the Changeling oppressor. Under the banner of the Equestrian Liberation Front, dissidents and ideologues of all stripes stand together, paying no heed to the doctrinal quibbles and internecine infighting that once plagued the subversive left and right alike, united in their common dream of a free Equestria.\nFrom Stalliongrad to New Mareland to the Riverlands, be they of the Three Tribes, or batponies, griffons, or hippogriffs, the brave fighters of the ELF have converged, from all over the world, to gather on the plains of the Equestrian East Coast. Alongside the Harmonic Resistance - now risen from the shadows - they take up arms to participate in this Liberatory Endeavour. The thirst for freedom had always burned within the hearts of the ponies living under the Changeling jackboot, and from those embers, a veritable firestorm has now erupted to scour the Queendom's black taint from Equestria's fair lands.\nAt the forefront stands the Duumvirate, Starlight Glimmer and Trixie Lulamoon - the matriarchs of revolution, heirs to the fallen Diarchy. But the uprising was borne not out of their visionary imaginings alone, but from the sacrifices of ponies bled and killed in the collective struggle against the invader; it is the blood, tears, and sweat of these unsung heroes that serve as the glue binding together the constituent parts of this nascent revolution.\nAt the dawn of what may well be Equestria's penultimate struggle, the ponies rally under a flag of the Sun and Moon combined - two symbols of Equestria united, flanked by swords drawn in their defense - in what may be the rebirth - or the last hurrah - of the Cradle of Ponykind."

From the Stalliongrad-funded socialist partisans from the north to the fanatically royalist Hollow Shades guerillas and from the anarchic Rough Raiders to... whatever the Society of the Black Hoof was meant to be. Yet, they were what they had to work with, and Starlight Glimmer cleared her throat.\n"I want to thank you all for coming, especially on such short notice," she addressed them all. "I had this whole speech planned out, but I'm not going to bandy words around here. The ELF has begun its uprising, and we've got the changelings on the ropes, but we can't do this on our own. Each of you have fought in your own ways for years, and you're exactly the kind of fighters we must have if we're to succeed. We've been divided too long, and the only way Equestria can be reborn is if we stand united."\nSadly, the proposition of unity was a hard sell for many of the different factions. Some of them had strict ideas about what Equestria should be, others were insistent on a return to the old ways. Starlight could give assurances, but many of them still were suspicious; of the ELF, of their chances and not the least of her. It came to a head with the grizzled leader of the Deepfall Timberwolves asking why they should rally their forces to, in the end, just put some old cult leader on the Equestrian throne. While Starlight answered their questions politely and calmly, desperate to find unity, Trixie's face slowly turned darker and darker until she couldn't keep it in any more."

On a whim, she had decided to pour over some of the papers from them just to see how things were flowing. As it turned out, it seemed that in this department of almost 50 ponies, one mare was carrying a near fifth of the workload on her own, and that was why Starlight had arranged a meeting with her. The mare, a pegasus named Lily Merrimare, seemed strangely nervous though.\n"Have... I done anything wrong ma'am?" She asked and Starlight raised an eyebrow. She seemed terrified.\n"No, no, not at all!" She assured Lily. "The opposite in fact. I was looking over some of the documents from your office, and you're pretty much doing half the job there on your own. You are wasted there, and I want to employ you at the head office of the ELF" Strangely, Lily seemed to only sink deeper in her seat at this. "What's wrong? \n"I..." Lily hesitated. "I am just a regular mare ma'am... I do not have high aspirations. I just want to do my little part and not bother anypony."\n"Lily..." Starlight cut her off at this point. "Equestria is fighting for her very existence. We don't have Celestia or Luna to count on any longer. Regular mares and stallions are what gives us a chance to even survive, and everypony has to do everything they can. Your part might well be what saves Equestria, and we can't take the chance of not using everyone's talents to the fullest. A talented administrator like you can see that, right?" she asked Lily with a smile, applying a little pressure on the mare. Lily lowered her head, nodding quietly.\n"Yes ma'am..." she murmured.\n"Great!" Starlight said. That was easy. "I will see you at the Head Office tomorrow!""

The action was quick and decisive, and there was not even a chance of resistance.\nThe rank and file rebels' destination was the internment camps, where chains and fetters waited for them along with guards to oversee their labors. The leaders, meanwhile, were taken to Manehattan, where a military tribunal had been set up to rapidly process them. Were they members of the resistance? Had they led the efforts of said resistance? The answers were dragged out of them by whatever means needed. With silence being treated as affirmation (for why would they be silent if they were innocent?), the trials could go swiftly, and the punishments as swiftly. Order would be restored by any means necessary\nAs all this happened, in the Crystaller Building, Lilac raised her glass to the gathered officers, toasting them. The gamble had worked. It had been chaotic and it had been bloody, but it had worked. The pony resistance had risen up at the worst of times, and thanks to her plans and the efforts of the Ost-Kommando, they were now broken.

In that time it was the CMC that had been a source of strength to them. To come together and to help other refugee fillies find their talents and somehow spend the days in a world that seemed to bleak and cruel around them. They just hadn't expected it to reach this stage. Staring at Starlight Glimmer, the four young mares tried to process what she was saying.\n"You... want to make the Cutie Mark Crusaders a nationwide organization?" Applebloom asked, just to make clear she had heard Starlight correctly, and Starlight nodded in response.\n"I've thought about it for a long time, and your group may just be what Equestria needs. Everypony has to do their part if we are going to win this, and that includes the children. I'm not going to give them guns and send them to fight, obviously. Not only would that turn all our allies against us, but most soldiers in the field would be more preoccupied with saving them than completing their objectives."\n"Also it would be despicable to do," Trixie muttered from further away.\n"Oh, uhm, yes of course," Starlight quickly caught herself.

And here she wasn't, the Duumvir Trixie Lulamoon, who had for so long agitated the ponies, promised them freedom, led them on this expedition, and yet was now nowhere to be found.\nA certain bitterness filled Verdant's heart. What would become of her? This battle was nothing short of hopeless. Would she be remembered by her friends and family as a hero, or would she become yet another statistic of this grim war?\nAs the merciless changeling onslaught continued, Verdant noticed something peculiar. It was a thunderstorm cloud - a massive cumulonimbus - drifting towards them unusually quickly, leaving a trail of heavy rain on the battlefield. The changelings didn't seem to be particularly perturbed, for they were preoccupied with pushing back the ponies with cheer. Verdant sighed and braced herself for the rain. Could this day get any worse?\nBut the rain never came."

MAN_ELF_new.1480.d:0 "As the cloud drifted above the clashing soldiers, a terrible booming noise echoed from its depths, startling pony and changeling alike. Before either knew what was going on, a vibrant torrent of energy blasts and bullets exploded out from within, raining down upon the absolutely unprepared changelings. The barrage from high was unrelenting, sending the changeling units into chaos as panic spread, causing many to flee in any direction to avoid the sudden attack.\nThe intense torrents of magic and firepower caused the cloud to quickly dissipate, and the truth of the situation immediately became obvious: shrouded within the thick folds of the cloud were teams of unicorn mages, two to a small blimp, flanked by a screen of airborne pegasi. It was apparent that the pegasi and the unicorns had combined their weather manipulation abilities and magic to conceal themselves within the cloud to launch a surprise attack from on high.\nAnd, shining like a flare at the forefront, was Trixie Lulamoon herself, her horn glowing fiercely with bright blue light as the pegasus-unicorn shocktroops hovered above the battlefield, her bursts of magic taking down multiple changelings at a time. The sight was beautiful and terrifying. Trixie's voice echoed from above. \"Don't give up hope, everypony! The great and powerful Tri- no, the great and powerful Resistance can take on any challenge! We fight for our loved ones! We fight for our home! We fight for Equestria!\"\nThe effect on both sides' morale was remarkable. The changelings, although still vastly outnumbering the ponies, were in a sorry state as entire companies broke up in the disorder and panic. And the ponies, who had previously been the ones nearly on a brink of a rout, were now cheering Trixie's name and charging into the disrupted changeling ranks. Verdant Flora joined in the counterattack, her eyes burning with newfound hope. Before the day was over, the ponies had completely repelled the attack and the changelings had suffered an incredibly embarassing defeat."

MAN_ELF_new.150.d:0 "The staff hall in the Manehattan Polytechnic was empty. Everypony was asleep, or working late into the night on some sort of government project. Or so it should have been, were it not for the two professors arguing as they sifted over a pile of leaflets which were distributed across the Protectorate just this morning as part of a greater "awareness campaign" providing information on the short-lived regime of Daybreaker and her Solarist government.\n\"I recognise this data. Our very institution procured it covertly during Daybreaker's reign. There is absolutely nothing inauthentic about these leaflets - it's less than neutral in tone but the data it presents is indisputably accurate\", the younger stallion explained.\n\"So what, pray tell, should one do in this situation? Do you figure the Resistance should come out and condemn a unifying symbol, and thus legitimise the Changeling occupiers? Do you realise the ramifications of such an act?\", the older professor retorted, annoyance tinging his voice. This assertion only agitated the younger professor further.\n\"A unifying symbol, my flank! Daybreaker was a war criminal! The atrocities committed by the Solarists are unspeakable, and you suggest we should disregard them in favour of some sort of faux unity? What about justice for the victims and their families?\"\nThe older stallion sighed and shook his head.\"The memory of Celestia is a crucial factor to uniting the ponies under a common cause. To aid the Changelings in tarnishing her memory would help absolutely nopony. It's not that I think it's right - it's that I think it's the lesser evil. The ponies must focus on the current threat at hoof.\"\n\"And how are we any better than our occupiers if we surrender our values and glorify a tyrant for our own benefit? How could we stand up to them and say we fight for freedom and Equestria after defending tyranny and injustice?\"\n\"The time for reconciliation and exposition of the truth will come, but only after we are rid of the Changeling yoke! The difference is that we do this for the greater good, whilst the changelings are simply tyrants who will resort to all means in oppressing and exploiting us.\"\nThe debate continued long into the night, and in the end it ended up going in circles with no conclusion in sight. It was, after all, a very difficult question. Should the ponies stay true to their values and swallow the propaganda condemning Daybreaker, therefore legitimising the Changeling regime? Or should they steel themselves and pay no heed to the slandering of Celestia's memory - no matter how factual and indubitably evil Daybreaker's crimes had been - in order to protect the ponies' unity against Changeling rule? There was no doubt the same debate was raging within the ranks of the Resistance."

Panzers and armoured bulldozers ramming through pathetic barricades to demolish the city blocks beyond; black plumes of smoke spewing from buildings set ablaze by cannon fire; the monolithic bleakness of the refugee camps on the far outskirts of Manehattan's urban sprawl; Changeling jackboots pounding down the rubble-strewn avenues of ruined neighborhoods. The scream of klaxons ringing through empty streets of districts slated for "redevelopment", populated only by ghosts and the desperate living. The camera lingering on the bawling face of the newborn foal clutched tight in his mother's grip, before they are swept away by the tide of ponies fleeing westwards into the setting sun, away from the carnage of Manehattan.\nLilac is snapped out of her reverie by the dinner conversation; down the table there is raucous laughter. Amongst the guests, Lilac recognises some faces; here the Chairpony of the now-acquiescent Fillydelphia Motors, there the Chief Financial Officer from Nidhogg, and other captains of industry and wealthy magnates, all here in celebration of the Protectorate's next ambitious exercise in triumphal grandeur - the construction of a planned city named after the victorious Queen, Chrysalia, within Manehattan itself.\nIn the next room over, an antechamber off of the opulent dining hall, the sounds of a muted argument are slowly growing louder, over a table strewn with maps and diagrams detailing the redevelopment of Manehattan. Lilac's interest is roused; she had expected fierce backlash to the Ost-Kommando's plan to remake the megalopolis in the Changeling image, but not at the very dinner party celebrating the launch of the plan!\nIt is a well-dressed pony who is arguing with a Changeling. Something stirs within Lilac, as she grasps at the emerging hope that she might have to call off the redevelopment plan after all. The image of the crying foal crosses her mind's eye, and when she lets it linger, his face morphs into that of a Changeling larvae; echoes of the changelings' Unification Wars.

Now now, she says, softening the bite of her stern tone with a trace of motherliness. What do we have here?\nTell the pony bastard, the changeling snarls (Lilac does not know his name), that the plan is not being postponed at the whim of some moralising sap who dares to stand in the way of progress, and at this vitriol the pony rears his head in anger. Lilac expects an impassioned plea for the salvation of the districts slated for demolition, the anguish of a creature who, in the depths of capitulation, had decided to finally take a stand against the unstoppable Changeling tide.\nThe ramifications of enacting such a plan on the Hayston area would be unconscionably horrific, the pony says, and delight blooms within Lilac as she discovers that perhaps somepony on her staff has retained some semblance of a conscience, or sanity, or both.\n"We would be better off arranging for much of the redevelopment to take place in Bronclyn, by the sea, where Chrysalia would benefit from a superior geographical location."\nThe pony keeps on talking, citing statistics and whatnot, whilst his changeling opponent responds with mounting anger. Lilac is no longer listening, her thoughts returned to scenes of misery and desolation wrought upon the city that she had been forced to rule over, but had nonetheless become her home.\nThe quiet brings her back to reality. What do you think, Lady Protectress, someone asks, and through her blurred vision she can no longer tell whether it was the pony or changeling that had spoke."

She never would have thought that the ELF's call for all ponies outside of Equestria help them in the fight against Chrysalis would have seen so many ponies come. There were thousands of them, some of them from places she never had heard of before, and she was overjoyed simply by the chance to spend time with all these different ponies!\nIn her eagerness, she ended up bumping into somepony and was sent sprawling to the ground. With her head spinning, she didn't at first notice the hoof that reached down to help pick her up. She could only mutter a slightly dazed thanks before looking up who had helped her. It turned out to be a stallion in the kind of blue uniforms she already had figured out came from Aquileia. She couldn't quite think that much more though, as she suddenly forgot how to.\n"That was quite the fall. Are you okay madmoiselle?" the stallion asked... could a voice sound like honey? Spring Morning could only barely muster up a small "yes". She kinda wished she hadn't, because the stallion smiled, leaving her heart to feel like it was going to jump out of her chest. "That is good, it wouldn't do for me to cause harm to my Equestrian cousins the first thing I do. I am Spirited Charge, formerly of the Royal Aquileian Army. I was told to report to Captain Stern. Do you know where I can find him?" \n"Y-yes, h-he's over there..." Spring Morning pointed towards the hotel further away, where she knew Captain Stern had set up his office. "Is that it," Spirited Charge asked before nodding. "Yes, I see. Thank you very much for your aid Madmoiselle," he said, taking her hoof and... kissing... it... \nAs the Aquileian stallion left for the hotel, he left behind a mare who suddenly had found herself hoping with twice the intensity that she'd have a chance to spend time with these foreign ponies - only now she was thinking of one particular pony."

Tighter organization can come later. I would normally say to do it by the book, but right now..." he glanced at the empty hallways. "There's not much in the book about these situations.

Yet again and again, like a crashing wave, you surged forth to fight; for your homeland, for your people, and for freedom! You did not have the Elements of Harmony, but you have courage and determination in endless amounts.\nAt first merely protestors in the streets, you masked themselves and began sabotaging the invaders' efforts. You then picked up weapons, waiting for opportunities to strike our enemy wherever they were the most vulnerable. When the great rising came, you rose up in the tens of thousands and ever since, you have carried this war of liberation! You are the strength in our legs, the champions of our freedom, indeed the heroes of the new age! They said the age of heroes were over, yet look at you now!

You are soldiers of Equestria, parts of an army greater than any Equestria has ever seen! From today, you are soldiers of the Ponies' Liberation Army!" As Trixie finished her speech, right on time, the squadron of pegasi shot past over her head with a roar, leaving streaks in the air in the Equestrian colors.

At the ransacking of what had been their former sanctum, there were those who took it with a sense of apathetic detachment. For others, it signalled a break with the old, a sort of violent induction into the ranks of the New Order.\nA Changeling flag now occupies the space where the crest of the MCPD once adorned the face of their headquarters.

Ponies had made a Nightmare Moon out of us, and there wasn't much that we could do to back then, other than make it as brief and as painless a process as possible. It was funny the first few times seeing their stares of disbelief when we turned out to be working members of society and not some Hatcher-damned monsters. Then the disbelief turned into apathy, and the whole process, while still rather unpleasant for them, became routine.\nSome people like routine; routine equates to safety. No news is good news and all. But I yearned for something out of it all, and it wasn't the love that I tasted when extracting it.\nI only discovered what it was earlier today at a café that had only opened up to changelings. I was persuaded by a fellow officer to try it out, as they supposedly have the best crepes in town. I'm not really a fan of them, but he's a colleague, so I obliged him. Everything was fairly normal, even the wary gazes from the pony patrons who recognised our uniforms.\nWhat surprised me was one of them who instead of shooting us a leer instead waved us over to his table. I recognised him as a resident from my district where I work. My colleague and I were confused, but we didn't taste anything suspicious from the stallion, just a warm and welcoming aura.\nWe shared a few drinks and delectable snacks before I had to ask: why was he so friendly to 'a bunch of Nightmare Moons in bug form?'\nI'll never forget what he told me. "Well, I know ponies don't like what your Queen's done, but that doesn't mean that we should hate you specifically. I still remember when the city was still barely more than rubble, and despite everything, you've done so much for us. You specifically don't want to see us suffer in misery, and you've done your darndest to make our lives that much easier. How can I hate you for that?"\nI don't expect to receive this gratitude from everypony that I meet, but he's gotten me thinking. Perhaps there's more that we could do for the ponies? Maybe I'm just hopelessly naïve, but I wouldn't mind being offered a mug of cider by more of the ponies that I come by.\n — An extract from a Hauptkäff-Love Collector's journal."

Many years ago I was convinced that our cutie marks only divided us; that all they provided were causes for arrogance and methods of control. I resented them, indeed hoped for a Equestria without these marks.\nBitterly and reluctantly, I came to learn that our cutie marks; our diversity, is so much more than that. In many ways, it is the fabric that holds us together. As long as we embrace - truly embrace - that our diversity is the source of our unity, then we are all stronger for it. The petty mind will look to those different from them, be it in customs, birth, livelihood or anything else, and dismiss them, lest they fear they are reduced themselves.\nIn doing so, they place their fragile egos above the welfare of everypony around them, preferring that we all are worse off instead of learning to understand and accept that which is unlike them. Once I was there, but no more. Now I see how Equestria is bound together not by any single pony, family or even tribe, but through this unity of cutie marks, individuals and tribes.\nWe are strong because we all contribute to a greater whole. We do not bicker about who contributes more, and we do not rush to blame the failings of our society on ponies just because they have or lack wings or horns. We are in this together, from the beginning to the bitter end, and division is just as petty and misguided as those who deflect blame onto their siblings. It may help in the heat of the moment, but in the long run all it does is weaken the fabric of the nation. Indeed, they are worse! Individuals may carry blame, but Earth Ponies, Pegasi or Unicorns never carry collective blame! Let blame stay where it belongs, with the single ponies, and let appreciation for the gifts our diversity brings shine down on all of us! We are Equestrians, we are many and we are different, but we are indivisible all the same!""

She could see the sandbag emplacement higher up where the changeling machine gun was from there, and not just one machine gun either, almost a company of changelings was gonna be up there! And she was alone on this side. This was crazy! She wasn't a hero, she was a knitter! Before all this all she'd wanted was a chance for her patterned scarves to be shown off to the world. She had used to dream about somepony, maybe even Rarity, discovering them and giving her a chance in high fashion. Yes, it was silly, it was her stupid little daydream!\nGlancing back again across the river, she could see Sour Apple run between the buildings and she winced when a bullet struck the wall right next to him. Sour Apple, Blue Moon, Zenith... looking up again, she gritted her teeth and pulled the pin out of one of the grenades. She was scared, she was terrified, but no one hurt her friends! The first grenade blew up the machinegun nest and cast up smoke enough that when Scarlet bolted up the slope and in among their positions she was covered enough. Another grenade flew, then yet another, as Scarlet focused on making as much damage as possible. Kicking down a changeling soldier, she tore up her submachine gun and sprayed the final position before tossing another grenade. It was all a blur of fire and death and smoke and sound...\nIt was somewhere there that all the strength just... vanished. Something felt wrong, and she stumbled, looking down to see the red spot spreading over her chest just as she collapsed. As in slow motion, she saw how a sneering changeling stepped up to her and raised his rifle at her. Why couldn't she move? She tried to breathe, but there was no way for her to get air. Right before the changeling could shoot her though, a flash of white blurred past. It was Zenith, the pegasus bodyslamming the changeling away with a choked roar as the others came rushing up as well, having managed to cross the bridge during Scarlet's rampage. Sour Apple especially ran to her side, hunching down and trying to help her up. Was... was he saying something? She wasn't sure... but he was okay... they were okay... she slowly closed her eyes, feeling how she slipped away."

We eat food just like you do!"\n"Don't y'all suck the juice outta ripe fruit?"\n"Why would you say that?" Ma Blumenbach asked him, still locked between disbelief and disgust. In the end she took a few deep breaths, starting to pace back and forth before she looked to Big Daddy McColt. "Look at our teeth," she said patiently. "Do they look fruit-sucking to you?"\n"No but I ain't ever hosted thestrals before." Big Daddy McColt said plainly. "I ain't got a clue about anything y'all do. Y'all been aliens to us for centuries and I ain't knowing jack about y'all. A few years ago I'd been ready to buck you outta my house, but I'm trying to be better. That good enough for you?"\n"Yes... yes it is," Ma Blumenbach said, taking a deep breath. "Just... please... for the sake of my children if nothing else. Let them grow up around ponies thinking of them as just another pony. If there's a difference I'll tell you, I promise, otherwise just let us be one of you."\n"You've got the McColt word of honour on that!" Big Daddy McColt promised there and then.

Taking off his hat, he put it to his chest and bowed his head. \n"Miss Starlight...

Scattered among the changeling commander's notes were terse references to a special project the changelings were involved in, titled "Operation Dusk Shine". It was about how to extract magic from a powerful magical being and use it on the battlefield.\nIt was all top secret, and the experiment hadn't born fruit yet... but a member of the project had arrived to pick up certain items in Canterlot that could've hopefully provoked a reaction in the target. They even had the target destination marked down... Twilight's old house.\n"Let me guess, we're going to trot off to save her, aren't we?" Trixie asked, and Starlight gave her a look. Trixie only smirked and flipped her hair. "I mean, it only makes sense, doesn't it? Even the Princess of Friendship needs the help of the Great and Powerful Trixie, and her loyal assis..." She could say no more after this as her mouth was blocked by Starlight's hoof.\n"You know you're my best friend, Trixie," Starlight said atonally, "but pack it in this one time."\nWhilst Trixie rolled her eyes, she didn't continue on with her usual spiel, instead turning to look at the documents herself.

Duty Price knew that he hadn't been Celestia's best little pony back before the war, but as it turned out being an aggressive and ruthless stallion was just perfect for times like these.\nTurning around the corner, he let his submachine gun roar before charging down the corridor. Much as the changelings had tried to stop them from getting into the [ELF_save_twilight_sparkle_missions_state_name_scripted_loc] facility, Price and his Deepfall Timberwolves were not going to be stopped, not after all this time! They were finally on the offensive, and they ripped through the bugs like a knife through a cake.\nBreaching the last door, Price fired his gun towards the ceiling and roared at the top of his lungs. "Down on the bucking ground, all of you!"\nThankfully, the changeling scientists didn't choose to make it hard on themselves and all surrendered, leaving Price to walk up to one of the scientists and pull him up to his face. "All right bug-boy," he growled. "Project Dusk Shine: talk!" While it took some shaking, the changelings seemed determined to stick to the smart course.\nDuty Price didn't know what the project was about. All he knew was that it had sent the Duumvirs into a tizzy. Still, ever since that moment general Lulamoon had ripped him a new one for being a petty moron he had concluded that they knew what they were doing. Therefore, if he could help by being the kind of stallion that had ended up in trouble back in the old days... well, he guessed everypony really had their place in the world."

A grenade exploded close to the ridge as Duty Price ran as fast as he could towards the nearest cover and throw himself in behind it. From the shouting further away, it seemed they hadn't been noticed yet, and looking back he saw how the rest of the squads were with him as well. Perfect!\nIt was pure fortune that they had caught up with the changeling Jaegers that were removing the information they sought from the [ELF_save_twilight_sparkle_missions_state_name_scripted_loc] compound, but the Timberwolves were now hot on their tails. Leaping out of cover again Price looked back to his team and made signs with his hoof for them to spread out before they all climbed the ridge, opening fire to flush the Jaegers out of their holes.\nAmidst the rocks and foliage, visibility was reduced to meters, so as Price led his team forward hooves and knives became just as useful as guns. For several minutes all was a blur of fighting and death, but in the end, as Price slowly pulled out his knife from the corpse of a Jaeger, it all was quiet.\nTwenty three soldiers lost... good soldiers, all of them. As they commandeered the truck the Jaegers had loaded with their objective, he got a cigar out and lit it. This Project Dusk Shine better be worth it."

Duty Price guessed he was not going to get any better evidence that Project Dusk Shine was really important.\nAbsently chewing his cigar, he waited as his soldiers began cutting into the giant safe that they had found in the back of the complex. It was the only place they hadn't searched this far, and the engineers took their time to not damage the contents.\nWhen the safe finally was opened after a near hour, Duty Price could pick out the contents. Just a single binder. Bringing it with him, he opened it to pour over the contents as they walked. Sure enough, Project Dusk Shine. There was more stuff here though... Some talk about "Subject A". A live test subject? He wouldn't put it past the bugs...\nWhile he couldn't make heads or tails of most of the stuff in there, he could at least tell that whatever Subject A was, it wasn't that they were testing anything on it, but what were they doing then?"

That was the only way he could explain the trap that had been sprung on them just as they breached the compound, and now it seemed like half the damn Changeling Army was out there.\n"Anjou," he yelled over the sound of gunfire. "Did you get the intel?!" His lieutenant rolled into cover further away before opening his satchel to show the dossier inside with a grin.\n"Just gotta get out of here alive, eh?" Red Anjou yelled back as Price scooted backwards.\n"Just give it a few minutes..." Price murmured, smirking to himself as he tried to get a few more potshots out of the window. It was true their plans had collapsed, but then again Price wasn't a stallion who made just one set of plans, and soon he could hear the gunfire from further away. The partisans were coming. Before long, bullets were flying at the besieging changelings from everywhere, leaving them the besieged ones.

Yet... on the other hoof she was a prisoner of the Changelings, and what more, they had been experimenting on her for months... maybe even years.\n"Where are they now?" she growled. Imagining what those bugs might have done to Twilight made her sick to her stomach.\n"From what we can tell," the Intelligence Officer stated, "they are putting her on a train towards Vesalipolis. We know they will be stopping in Acornage at some point, and that will be our only clear option to strike.\n"Can we get there in time?" Trixie asked quietly.\n"We have to," Starlight declared.

Why?!"\n"They are doing all they can, Starlight," Trixie tried to calm her to no avail."What of the northern front?" she turned to the staff officers around them. "Any breakthroughs? How about the airships?"\n"Nothing ma'am," one of the aides said rapidly. "The situation is unchanged and we won't achieve our objectives on time."\n"What about the Timberwolves? Can we contact partisan groups in the area? Anything?!"\n"The Timberwolves went dark two hours ago, partisan units in the area are spent...

Iron wheels started screeching, throwing up showers of sparks as the train ground to a halt and sending a lot of the changelings inside it tumbling. At this, ponies sprang out of hiding all around it. Snipers and partisan sharpshooters took aim at the train from further away, blowing out every window they could see as the Timberwolves charged it, leaping up between the carts and breaking down the doors.\nStarlight Glimmer had refused to stay behind, instead joining the attack. She ripped down one of the walls of the train cart with her magic, too enraged to give a damn about finesse. Catching every last changeling in the cart, she smashed them into the ceiling with the force of a wrecking ball. The walls and ceiling of the train were peeled away under the raw force of her magic as she advanced from cart to cart, a seething energy field around her and bolts of blinding energy turning the changelings that tried to stop her to ashes. "WHERE, IS, SHE!?" she roared, her voice thundering across the train as she peeled the next cart open like it was paper. "YOU WON'T WIN! YOU WON'T ESCAPE! ANSWER OR YOU WILL ALL DIE!"\nThe terrified and surrounded changelings soon surrendered, and as Starlight tore down the last doorway their prize was revealed. A thick, semi-translucent cocoon stood in the middle of the cart, inside of which the lost Princess of Friendship, Princess Twilight Sparkle, laid silent and unmoving. Duty Price walked silently up to the cocoon, taking his knife, slicing the container open and gently catching her as she came tumbling out of it. A slow groan came from her lips and her eyes, for the first time in Celestia knew how long, fluttered open."

Go!"\nRolling her neck and stretching her wings, Storm Cloud rose from her prone position on the cloud and grabbed the satchels by her side before launching herself off the cloud and accelerating explosively enough that she left a trail in the air and catching up to the train in less than a minute. Blazing past it, she caught up with the locomotive and went into a spin. The momentum let her launch the satchels like from a slingshot onto the locomotive, in between the wheels and even through the window of the locomotive, and with a sharp turn outwards she slammed down the button on her remote to blow it all up. The shockwave struck her and she was sent crashing helplessly into the ground as the now burning locomotive tumbled off the rail, dragging several of the rail carts with it.\n"Shimmerswirl, juice us up!"

It felt fitting, somehow, for what she was doing.\nSo much had happened in these last months and years, from the war to her being captured and then freed by Starlight and Trixie's army. Now she stood before something she never could have imagined would happen: she was going to ascend the throne of Equestria. Celestia and Luna weren't around, and yet, Equestria wanted a princess. What more, with the chaos of the last years, she needed to be more than just the Princess of Friendship; she needed to be the Princess of Harmony itself. Equestria needed a symbol after all. She had a hard enough time imagining herself as a princess, but a princess with so lofty a title? It was absurd, and she felt like she would be just a nice display piece for ponies to look at.\n"Are you ready, your highness?" a voice asked behind her. Twilight schooled herself, putting on a smile as she turned around to follow the pony that had been sent to bring her to the coronation.\nAs she entered the great chamber where the people were waiting, she was met with a throng of cheering ponies, hundreds of them. More than one of the ponies in attendance were crying as well, and their sheer joy hit her like a tonne of bricks, giving her a sudden resolve.\nMaybe she felt like just some stupid filly playing princess, but as she looked at all the ponies, so happy for her return, she decided she'd play the best princess she possibly could."

Within seconds, several of the vehicles escorting the convoy were already burning and dead guards lay everywhere.\nThe changelings weren't done yet though, and many of the guards still were standing to begin firing back at their attackers as, inside one of the tanks, a desperate call went out to up in the sky, demanding help from above. They were not pleading to their gods though, they were calling for the air force wing that had been stalking them to intervene. Turning sharply downwards, the pilots moved into attack formation, ready to strike at the bastards who had been turning this entire region of Equestria into a nightmare to transport things through. Their machineguns roared as they broke through the clouds and bullets rained down on both sides of the convoy, killing several of the attackers.\nYet, as they roared past and turned around for another strafe, one pegasus launched himself into the air, holding a sniper rifle. Turning mid-air, he angled his wings so he glided backwards and could rest his sniper rifle on his stomach just as they turned around. Once, thrice and five times his rifle rang out, and soon some of the planes dropped out of the sky with smoking engines. Turning downwards, he avoided their return fire only just, reloading mid-air before landing and firing after the now departing planes, hitting one more of them.\nThe rest of the planes disengaged, not having expected to face this kind of resistance, and as the battle around the convoy died down, Soarin pulled back his flight mask and looked to his soldiers, nodding to himself.

For all these years of fighting and occupation, some small part in the back of his head still had hoped for the old chain of command to remain intact, and yet that was not the case even in the slightest. Field Marshal Blueblood was nowhere to be found, the stallion he once had personally escorted from the Wonderbolt headquarters was now a high-ranking officer, and what more the most successful of all Equestrian resistance movements were led by a former showpony and a former cult leader.\n"How do you feel?" Starlight Glimmer asked him where he stood in front of her. Whiplash shrugged.\n"Like the world has gone topsy-turvy," he deadpanned. "But if it's still sane enough that I'm still useful, then I'm yours, ma'am." After years having gone underground, helping refugees and trying to help those who lost everything it would be good to be back in the fight again. Starlight smiled, reaching out a hoof to him and he shook it.\n"Welcome back, General Whiplash," she told him, leaving Whiplash to raise an eyebrow.\n"That was easy," he commented.\n"I mean I could put you through twenty years of service to reach general's rank if that'd feel more natural to you," Starlight offered and Whiplash shrugged."

Sighing, Starlight looked towards it. "Think they're drunk again?" she asked Trixie, who groaned.\n "Let's just leave it," she told them. "The military police should be able to..." she said right before a pony came half flying out of the door, rolling along the ground and coming to a stop in the middle of the street. Three more ponies followed in rapid succession before a tall pegasus in sunglasses came marching out.\n"Alright you lot," he said, "We do this the easy way or the hard way. Are you coming quietly to the MPs with me?"\n"Well, that was impressive," Trixie remarked. "Who would you happen to be?" She asked, as she came up to the pegasus, who saluted her.\n"Ma'am! Fast Clip, formerly of the Wonderbolts. These miscreants were making a ruckus, and I decided to intervene."\n"And you handled them single-hoofedly?" Starlight asked, looking at the four ponies who still were lying in their pile.\n"I have experience with unruly ponies, ma'am," Fast Clip told them. "Fact of the matter is, I was hoping to offer my services to the ELF. Might I impose for some of your time after I have gotten these drunks to the MPs to cool off?"

MAN_ELF_new.190.t:0 "The Old Guard"
MAN_ELF_new.190.d:0 ""So where have you been these last years?"" Starlight asked the stallion in front of her. These last years had been hard on everyone to be sure, but of all the ponies she had seen, Blueblood seemed to have aged twenty years at the least. He was immaculately dressed still, but the look on his face was that of someone utterly exhausted.\n"Across most of Griffonia," Blueblood answered, "I took the opportunity to study the conflicts across that continent. The griffons know a lot about warfare, things that could have been useful to know before the war. I have compiled what I've learned, and I wanted to offer you my services, such as they are."\n"There is a story here, isn't there?" Starlight had never interacted with Blueblood before, but the stories Rarity had told her had suggested a radically different pony, and she found herself curious. She therefore decided to dig further.\n"I..." Blueblood said reluctantly, "I was made a Field Marshal because I lobbied for it. I wanted the fancy title, and when the war came I was unprepared for the reality of it. Maybe no single pony is wholly to blame for what happened to Equestria, but I was part of it. I have to make amends somehow, and this is the best I can do." Starlight couldn't have denied him even if she would have wanted to. Staring into his eyes, she saw too much of herself; an angry, self-loathing pony who had to make it right somehow, even if they didn't feel they deserved a second chance. She nodded slowly after a while, deciding to give him what he wanted.\n"Just your desire for redemption won't mean a thing. We will expect results, and you will provide them. If what you've documented is of use we'll use it, otherwise you will have to find another way to earn your place, is that understood?" Blueblood bowed his head to her as she finished."

MAN_ELF_new.191.t:0 "The Blueblood Camarilla"
MAN_ELF_new.191.d:0 "Standing on the balcony overlooking the forest below, Blueblood thought about his situation. It had been an odd experience to return to the circles of the Equestrian high society, not the least with how things had changed. He did not begrudge his fellow elites their concerns over the radical nature of certain factions within the new Equestria. Nor did he deny that if the talk of democracy was sincere then there was no reason why the upper class should not get involved as well. And yet, he found himself less than amused by the prospects given to him. So many among the nobility and the new rich only saw politics as a method to make sure they kept their properties and titles. Still, you went to war with the army you had, and he turned around as two ponies he knew he could rely on came out on the balcony as well.\n"It's been a while, has it not old boy?" Fancy Pants said, coming up to shake his hoof. Always the smiler, always the thinker, and Blueblood had no doubt he already had a good idea of what was to come.\n"Indeed it has," Blueblood replied before nodding his head to the other pony. "Sir," he said succinctly to his old teacher, who grunted.\n"I am an old pony and I prefer at least to get my sleep on the right time," Neighsay told him. "Unless you imagine that the entirety of whatever scheme you have concocted can be planned out in an evening, I would prefer it if our introduction to it was brief. Details can come later." He was as blunt as always. Blueblood couldn't deny he found it refreshing though.\n"It is about this talk of a coalition among the elites," Blueblood explained himself. "You probably both know there's talk of me leading it. But I have plans, and I need reliable ponies around me to achieve it. The average noble will not have the stomach for what needs to be done if we are to be a genuine alternative to Starlight Glimmer and her radicals. Leave if you wish, but I hope you will hear me out."\n"Go on?" Neighsay asked, eyes narrowing. Fancy Pants meanwhile did not say much, but he raised his eyebrow and leaned forwards, clearly interested. "

MAN_ELF_new.192.d:0 ""Was lord High Faluting receptive?" Blueblood asked Fancy Pants as the two walked along the road to the dinner party ahead.\n"Quasi-receptive, let us say," Fancy Pants chuckled. "He was not initially too fond of your more radical notions. I do believe the words "another form of treason" was used. He calmed down when realizing he did not really have a choice in the matter. But tell me, old boy, you mentioned your Griffonian adventures had been quite illuminating. Would you care to finally elaborate on this?" Fancy Pants helped himself to a drink from one of the waiters and sipped it.\n"Creatures, be the ponies or griffons, need stability," Blueblood said as he helped himself as well. "When times become unruly they seek out radical ideologies when the old ideals no longer provide sufficient answers. And when do the old ideals no longer deliver? Well, the great Griffonian Empire was torn apart because of vacillating rulers who took their positions for granted. In Aquileia, even beating down these extremists just led to another explosion later on because the issues were not addressed at the start."\n"And what were those issues?" Fancy Pants asked.\n"That the average griffon did not feel a stake in their nation any longer. It abandoned them, so they abandoned it. Times were hard, so it is understandable, but while they were seduced by radicals and maniacs, the nobility were too consumed by their own power games to remind the people what made the nation great to begin with." Blueblood looked out to the window, seeing the sunlight stream in through it.\n"Auntie Celestia kept this land safe for a thousand years, and yet now when she is no longer here ponies can forget how much she did. She created a millennium of peace, but somehow the answers she provided are no longer good enough. We need to remind ponies of what she did, of how she did it. We need to champion the values of that Equestria, the best possible version of them, and that is not a version where the rich and powerful saunter around consumed by their own concerns. We rose to the top in that world, but if we can't champion its values then - frankly - we have no business reaping its fruits.""

In the end, she had to go back to Canterlot, even if she desperately wanted to stay. She'd have to come up with something. She should send letters to their families and ask, or maybe put up messages in Ponyville? She had to do something. As she returned to her quarters she was so deep in thought that she didn't notice the way her books had been picked out of the shelf and stacked in neat piles on the floor. At least not before she almost tripped over them.\n"What the...?" she asked to herself and looked around before hearing a flapping sound.\n"You'd think the staff in Canterlot would be a little more thorough," the voice said behind her and Twilight spun on the spot to face it. "They simply alphabetized the bookshelves, not caring about categories or genres. They really don't know about the six-week rule for bookmarks either, but I guess I can't fault them there."\n"S...Spike?" Twilight asked breathlessly as the young dragon landed right in front of her. He was so tall. The little dragon she remembered was taller than her now, with the babyfat replaced with slabs of muscle and his childish face having grown a jaw that seemed like it could crush rocks. The awkward look on his face was just like she remembered it though, and he scratched the back of his head.\n"Hey Twilight... have you missed me?" He had barely finished the question before Twilight had almost tackled him, wrapping her forelegs around him as she felt the tears come flowing uncontrollably. She wanted to speak and say something, but it was all she could do to hold onto her little brother and number one assistant."

Was... was I gone so long?" she suddenly trailed off as the implications came to her.\n"No, no, not really," Spike hurriedly assured her. "I mean yeah, it's been a while, but dragons don't grow THAT fast. No, I got a potion from Zecora!" He flexed his arm to show the muscles on it for emphasis. "She said it was dangerous, but I wasn't afraid. I needed strength to help with the resistance! There were some, uh, side effects, but aside from that I've felt great."\n"That's so fascinating!" Twilight said, outright awed by what he said. To think what zebra potions were capable of! At first she wanted to take notes, but she remembered herself and hugged Spike again. That was what mattered now. "Oh I'm so glad you're back Spike. Do you know where any of the others are?" she asked him after a while and noticed how Spike tensed up. "Spike?"\n"Ehehehe." Spike looked awkward all of a sudden. Twilight couldn't have missed the look on his face if they so had been in a pitch black room. He didn't want to tell her and Twilight could only feel a surge of fear.\n"Spike. Please tell me. I have to know. Nopony is telling me anything, and I am worrying myself sick." Her plea seemed to take as Spike visibly deflated, hanging his head.\n"Figures that I am the one who have to tell you..." he muttered sourly. "Fluttershy vanished during the first uprisings in the Everfree and nopony's seen her for years. Rainbow Dash was shot down over Marechester. They never found a body, but if she was alive she'd have come back by now. Pinkie's alive, but she's not really Pinkie any more. The war got to her, bad.

MAN_ELF_new.1931.d:0 "The Fillydelphia streets were teeming with ponies from all over Equestria, with the main road packed to a level where it was at times hard to even move. The walls of the buildings were lined with photos and messages, with giant letters on the rooftops to indicate which names went were. Ponies walked from wall to wall, pouring over the countless messages, fervently trying to find something from those they lost contact with during the war. Pegasi flew back and forth, many of them carrying other ponies on their backs to help them move around. In one corner, an auctioneer was using his talents to loudly and rapidly call out names using a loudspeaker, yelling out the names of those the ponies around him sought.\nTwilight Sparkle had ended up under A, scanning after Applejack's name, when she noticed a young colt trying to jump so that he could see the wall as well. Picking him up with her magic, she helped him to scan the wall for his aunt. The poor kid was emaciated, and she wondered what had happened to his parents. She decided not to ask though, she could hazard a guess. When they found the name and an address she gave the wall a quick look, deciding she could come back to it later, she needed to make sure that he got there safely. Thankfully, the address wasn't too far off, and a quick flight later she was treated to the sight of the colt's aunt tearfully hugging him, thanking her over and over for finding him.\nUpon returning to the wall and keeping up looking, she realized after nearly an hour that she couldn't see Applejack's name anywhere. Maybe Fluttershy would be under F then? Continuing down the wall, she reached F after several minutes and began pouring over it, asking if anypony had seen anything. No bet here either. The same for Pinkie Pie, Rarity and Rainbow Dash. Finishing at S for Spike, she realized with a sinking feeling in her heart that she couldn't find any of them. None of them had left anything to show their whereabouts. Quietly, she realized what it might mean but shook her head. No, there had to be some other explanation. Maybe they hadn't gotten here yet. Maybe they'd be here tomorrow. She had to come back tomorrow. They'd have left something then. She just needed to keep looking..."

MAN_ELF_new.194.d:0 "The courtroom was packed to the brim and Twilight only barely managed to enter the stands overlooking the procedure. Her stomach flipped at the sight, seeing how Rarity sat in the accused's seat, right next to... Suri Polomare? And what more, Rarity was sitting slouched together, almost as though she had already been sentenced, while Suri almost preened where she sat.\n"Suri Polomare and Rarity," the prosecution said, reading out their crimes. "During the occupation of Manehattan, you produced new uniforms for the Changelings' jägers that they used in hunting down our people. Uniforms specifically meant for city combat, and which helped them kill many ponies. This was not an assigned job, but rather you actively courted the Lilac administration with it." Twilight could only listen in silent disbelief at what she was hearing.\n"As you'll find, your honour," Suri stated airily, "the designs for those changeling uniforms were, one hundred percent, Rarity's designs. I was merely a producer of the garments, but she was the brain behind it."\n"How do you respond to this, miss Rarity?" the judge asked and a sniffle came from Rarity.\n"It's true!" she suddenly wailed, crying openly. "I designed all of it! I came up with the cut of the jackets and the seams, I put in every last hook and belt loop on it with my own two hooves! I am completely responsible for those uniforms, and every last bit of impact they had was due to me!" she trailed off in sobbing as her attorney stared at her in horror.\n"Y-your honour," he tried to butt in. "My client was under coercion the entire time and...!"\n"But I still did iiiiit!" Rarity cried, and Suri leaned back, the very picture of smug satisfaction."

"I had no part in this beyond regular business, and she was the one who made them." She nudged her attorney, who reluctantly asked for another witness to be called in. This witness, Under Cover, had been a counter-infiltrator in the changeling occupation forces, and the prosecution wheeled in examples of the uniform for him to comment on. Under Cover looked at the uniforms before chuckling.\n"Those... were the most evil clothes I have ever worn! They were great during the first month or so, but the more you used them, the more they just... hurt. They started squeezing in odd places, seams dug in right between the changelings' shells and if you laid down you'd have buttons pushing straight into your crotch. Laying down hurt like you wouldn't believe! Honestly, during the uprising, I'd say those uniforms did the work of a hundred ponies in distracting and tormenting the jägers! Who made those uniforms? I want to shake their hoof!"\nSilence reigned in the hall when Under Cover was done with his story. The judge's eyes were open wide, Suri Polomare's smirk had been traded for a look of horror and Rarity had straightened up, reaching over to gently push Suri's mouth closed. The case was more or less finished there and then. Suri and Rarity had both agreed after all: Rarity had the full credit for how the uniforms had impacted the war, and she was cleared of all charges.\nAs she got up from her seat she looked back to the still paralysed Suri and leaned in to whisper in her ear. "I do find gloating tacky, dear." she purred before turning and leaving, making sure to hip-check Suri as she passed her by. When she exited the room Twilight was already there to meet her, eyes wide with awe as she threw herself at her friend to hug her.\n"That-that." she could only say, still in awe by what just had happened.\n"Hello darling," Rarity answered "I'm sorry I couldn't come earlier, as you saw I was preoccupied."\n"But, that was amazing Rarity, how did you even manage to pull something like that off, that was..." Twilight stopped now as Rarity suddenly leaned against her, seemingly struggling to stay on her hooves.\n"I'm sorry darling. I just realized. I'm out... years under that utter slag... and I'm out...

MAN_ELF_new.196.t:0 "One Bad Apple?"
MAN_ELF_new.196.d:0 "Applejack looked like she had aged twenty years, and her eyes were bitter and hard where she sat behind the desk, listening to the prosecution reading out the charges levied against her. Was it true that during the changeling occupation Sweet Apple Acres expanded massively, using Changeling funds? Was it true that they, through this aggressive expansion, had provided a large amount of the changeling army's food supply? Was it true that she had personally courted the local governor to be able to take Ponyville residents as slave labor, employing thousands towards the end? Applejack answered yes at every question, leaving Twilight watching everything in disbelief and horror in equal amounts.\nAs her lawyer stood up though, he took out a small book and read from it. The book was from the Sweet Apple Acres offices, and as the lawyer read it all out, he named worker after worker along with their notes, drawing special attention to how Applejack had meticulously kept track of how long they had worked, how badly they reacted to the "love tax" and what other needs they had. Asking several questions from Applejack for clarity, he painted a wholly different picture: one where Applejack might have expanded Sweet Apple Acres to a giant factory farm, but where she had done so to shield as many of her more vulnerable neighbors as possible from the changelings feeding on them.\nThe prosecution called these things speculations and wishful thinking, saying she could just as well have employed ponies at her regular farm if giving out work was so important. The central plains had been vital to the changelings' food supply, and actively expanding still constituted collaboration and has caused harm to other ponies. \nIn return, the defense noted that it had taken over a year for Applejack to actually start expanding her farm, a year during which she continued her regular practices and hired only as many as she could. Quotas had not been met that year, and an extra love-tax had been used as punishment. Three workers had died and twelve had been hospitalized as the changelings had imposed a particularly harsh drain on their emotions. It was first after that that Applejack had expanded, not a second before.\n After hours of exhausting back and forth, the Judge had heard enough and declared his verdict."

Yet she found an Applejack not nearly as pleased. Instead, she was standing outside the court building, pounding her hooves into a tree.\n"Stupid, fancy flank, chatterbox, horseapple!" she was snarling, punctuating every word with a punch at the tree, only stopping when Twilight pulled her away."Twilight? Oh. You saw all that huh?" Applejack asked, still too worked up to stop being angry. "Buck it all to Tartarus. Why? Why did that damn lawyer have to butt in?! Couldn't he just have minded his own damn business and let me pay mah dues?! Is everything so messed up now that Ah'm gonna have to get away with all this?!"\n"But—didn't the lawyer tell the truth?" Twilight asked, not understanding why her friend was still so angry. "That you did what you had to?\n"Had to?!" Applejack yelled as she began to pace."You know what Ah had to do? Ah had to watch three of mah friends die before Ah got it into mah thick skull that it'd only get worse unless Ah did something—anything! Ah had to bow and scrape for that preening bug instead of punching him in his stupid face when he preened at me! Ah had to sell out the entire Apple family way of doing things and turn mah home into a factory! AH HAD TO SUCK UP TO FLIM AND FLAM TO GET THEIR BUCKING MACHINES SO AH COULD DELIVER WHAT THE BUGS WANTED!" She began pounding the tree again, even harder this time.\n"Ah had to send off mah life's work for the changelings to eat as they butchered mah fellow ponies! Ah had to lie, scheme, sit there with that damn list and choose who of mah neighbors Ah'd send to the slaughter! And now Ah had to listen to that plothole in a tie make excuses for me!" In the end, it was as though the air went out of Applejack and she sank down on the ground, covering her face.\n"Ah know you forgive me Twilight. Mah neighbors probably will too. But Ah ain't never going to forgive mahself. Ah ain't gonna make excuses, Ah still helped them, and now Ah'm made out to be some tragic hero." Lowering her hooves, she stared up into the sky. "You still need me, Twilight? 'Cause if Ah ain't got helping you, Ah don't know what Ah have that's still me right now.""

She would have barreled right in, but the letter had very pointedly and politely asked she observed due discretion, and therefore she had instead gone to the nearby city of Rockville, where Limestone had met her to "show her something".\nThis "something" was the local day care, which Twilight noted was open despite being so late in the afternoon. She grimaced when they peered in through one of the windows and saw the downcast looking children inside. Of course... orphans.\n"So many of them..." she said to herself.\n"Used to be even more," Limestone commented. "Watch." As she finished this word the door at the far end of the room they watched burst open. Like a cotton candy tornado, Pinkie Pie came whirling in, as vibrant and joyful as Twilight had ever remembered her, and her infectious cheer lit up the room within moments.\n"Oh! What's that in your ear?" she asked one of the younger fillies, pulling out a cupcake from it. "Hey! Caramel! I wonder if I have anything." Stopping, she reached into her own ear, seemingly rummaging around. "Wait, no that's the piano, no that's the ottoman. What is an ottoman anyway? Aha!" As she pulled her hoof out an entire three-layer cake followed, with candles and everything. Twilight could only pull back from the window and sigh in relief.\n"Don't count your rocks before they've been dug up," Limestone muttered, dragging Twilight to the back of the daycare where they hid by the bushes. There, some time later, Twilight realized what Limestone had meant as they saw Pinkie leave after a while, looking utterly spent.

Please don't believe that we think you have to be happy and cheerful after everything that's happened."\n"But I'm supposed to be the element of laughter, and I can't even smile without faking it. When everypony needed me to be my most cheerful I couldn't. All of... everything... I don't know if I'm still me." Twilight could feel how Pinkie began to shake and she tightened her embrace. After a while, Pinkie hugged back, a slow, shivering breath escaping her. "I even forgot how to cry," she whimpered. Twilight said nothing, only holding her friend to give her the time she needed. "I'm not broken," Pinkie whispered in the end, "I swear. I'm putting myself back together, the glue is just bad."\n"You don't have to prove anything to me, or anypony else," Twilight whispered back. "Please, just that you're okay is all I ask for. We missed you."\n"I missed you too," Pinkie replied. "Can I still come with you?" Twilight could only frown at this, stroking her friend's hair.\n"I told you Pinkie, you don't have to prove yourself."\nPinkie pulled away, wiping her cheeks. "Yeah, to other ponies. I'm scared of going back to Ponyville... but I have to. I was scared of seeing you, but it feels better now, a little, at least. And I miss my friends.

Say what you will about the bugs, but they know how to get things done quickly and in an organised manner.\n"Not having been told what was happening, some of the adults openly wept in fear that these was one of the rumoured executions.

At least she was there now and decided to play nice with Shield Wall and Spearhead, the two stallions that had followed her here. They seemed at first insistent to play stony, but Donut Joe identified them as two of his best customers and pointed Twilight to what they'd prefer. Within a minute they left the donut shop, Twilight having her box of donuts and the two guards awkwardly eating a Pistachio Glaze and a Triple Chocolate donut respectively.\n"You have good taste, I like those too!" Twilight told them merrily. "I've got a couple more of those, if you'd want to you can have those when we get ba-ACK!" she croaked when Shield Wall suddenly tackled her to the ground and threw up a barrier over them, with Spearhead firing a bolt of energy straight into the sky. Something above her was hit and she heard a grunt as someone crashed into the ground with Spearhead charging forward at it. It all went so fast that she didn't quite get what was happening as Shield Wall got off her and charged the attacker as well. After a couple of seconds, however, a loud clang of two helmets being banged against each other rang out and a loud voice yelled out.\n"Pack it in, you horseapples!" The voice was way too familiar and Twilight looked up, seeing Rainbow Dash tower over the two unconscious guardponies, rubbing the side of her head. "Right, lesson learned, never try to surprise a friend when YOU two jerks are around. Hey Twilight!" She continued with a grin, coming over to help her up. Twilight meanwhile could only stare at her. Maybe she shouldn't be surprised, but the scars that criss-crossed Rainbow's face and the prosthetic left wing left her speechless at first. "Yeah I know," Rainbow chuckled, "I look like every pony in Uglyville bucked me in the face. But hey, look at you! All princessy and stuff! Never thought it'd suit you that well, egghead!"\nThat was the point that Twilight felt herself able to react. All she could do was to burst into laughter and embrace her friend. "I can't believe it!" she said, "Where have you been? What happened? Tell me everything!"\n"Yeah yeah, I will!" Rainbow Dash said. "Only: do you have any cider? Seriously I haven't had a decent mug in years and I'm going crazy! Me, you, cider, talk about what's happened?""

"You don't know how long I've missed having a drink that actually tastes something."\n"You're right, I don't," Twilight agreed, still dismayed by the way her friend has been maimed, but relieved that she seemed to still be the Rainbow Dash she remembered. "What have you been up to? Last I heard, you were shot down over Marechester during the last days of the invasion."\n"Uuuuugh," Rainbow Dash groaned, "Do we have to? Would it be okay if we just got blasted on cider for the evening and take all the touchy-feely stuff-hey!" she exclaimed as the bottle was torn out of her grip by Twilight's telekinesis. "Fiiine. Yeah they shot me down. I thought I could take on a squad of fighters on my own and well... yeah." she said as she spread the prosthetic to indicate what she meant. "I crashed in the lake and still have no idea how I managed to crawl ashore. Some of the local resistance ponies found me and dragged me to this underground base they had in the Honey Forest. They even had a hospital there!"\n"Is that where you got the prosthetic?" Twilight asked quietly.\n"Yeah! And the docs there couldn't have been greater jerks about it!" Rainbow exclaimed. "It was all "weeh weeh you rush around to command soldiers, you need to rest" and "wuuh wuuh you gotta take it CAREFUL with the new wing". Like, if I can't use it at once, what's even the point?! They even strapped me down in the end! Strapped, me, down! While Equestria was fighting back I was tied down in some horseapple's bed because they couldn't get the wing to work right off!" Her anger had grown and it was more like an explosion now as she ranted. Twilight quietly put a hoof on her shoulder to calm her down and Rainbow reluctantly stopped her outburst.\n"I know... I know..." she said, taking a few breaths. "I'm just a LITTLE angry I was this useless. Top Wonderbolt here, and I could have just spun on the spot and made windmill noises for all the help I was. I'm good though, I'm good. I've done my crying and ranting about it. You should have seen me a few months ago. I'm back, I'm not useless and I'm ready to fight again, wherever needed.

As Twilight flew over it she thought to herself that the world could burn to cinders, and this place would always be this vicious. Even war hadn't dampaned its anger she thought as the Roc descended from above, screaming in rage as it forced her to make a sudden teleportation to get down into the forest to take cover. She barely was down, however, before a snarling Chimera came at her and her second teleport sent her tumbling into the swamp, where she barely was on her hooves before an enraged Hydra rose up over her.\n\nAt this something snapped inside her. Usually she would have been content with playing it safe, but if the forest was really going to be this hostile, even when all she wanted was to find her friend, she was not going to run! Purple light exploded around her as she summoned up all the magic she had, making the forest tremble.\n\n"I'm sorry, but I'm not playing!" she screamed, grabbing the Hydra's heads with her telekinesis and slamming them against each other. She let the beast drop before grabbing the pouncing chimera and threw it past her and into a tree. Unleashing a wave of magic from herself, she sent over a dozen timberwolves flying backwards before turning around, ready to deal with another threat. That, however, was when she froze. She found herself unable to move or use her magic, frozen in place by the overwhelming, crushing force of the eyes that were locked onto her."

There was nothing sensible or specific about it, it was merely an overwhelming willpower that wouldn't let her go. It was too angry with her to do so, and Twilight gasped under the pressure. Around her, she could hear how the monsters were approaching again, and suddenly it all came together to her.\n"F-Fluttershy..." she gasped, "It's me Fluttershy..." Fluttershy didn't respond to her though, only kept staring her down with small, choked sounds coming from her, more akin to a terrified animal than a pony. Twilight tried desperately to think, come up with something, but the Stare was too strong to think properly!\n"They..." she groaned after a while. "They were protecting you weren't they? I... I hurt your friends. I'm sorry." At this, it seemed as though there was something that clicked in Fluttershy's eyes and the stare ended. She blinked; comprehension slowly dawning in her eyes. With it - though - came terror, and she backed away, seemingly about to flee.\n"Fluttershy wait!" Twilight hurried to exclaim, "It's over, there's peace, no more fighting, no more war!" She didn't approach the terrified mare, instead choosing to hunch down and fervently plead with her friend to not run away. Slowly talking her down, Twilight took one, then two, then three steps forward. "Please Fluttershy, it's all over. We can go home."\n"H-home?" Fluttershy whispered, her voice breaking as if she hadn't used it in years. Twilight nodded and slowly held out one hoof to Fluttershy, being rewarded with her friend almost tackling her, clutching her as tears burst from Fluttershy's eyes at the end of this years long nightmare.\nTwilight held her friend close, too relieved to say anything at first. As the shadow fell over her - though - she looked up, seeing the Hydra tower above them. It wasn't angry she realized. It was worried. It was strange, but she couldn't help but feel kinship with the monsters that formed a circle around them, whining and pacing at the sound of her tears."

Flat Shovel had taken it on himself to investigate what was going on. If those damn bugs had torched the place there would be neighbors who needed shelter.\nThe village was all but disappearing as Flat Shovel reached it, being consumed by fire before his eyes. Near every building had been set ablaze... Grimacing, he walked deeper inside, trying to see where his neighbors were. Had they been taken? Or were they in hiding? Where though? Everything was burning. He quietly begged that they were just hiding somewhere, and he hurried in between two buildings to get between the fires and deeper into the village. Please let them be okay, Celestia please let them...\nFreezing as he came into the village square, Flat Shovel stared at the sight in front of him. He blinked, trying to process what he was seeing, and in the end he turned and half stumbled, half ran, from the village back home to gather the others. Returning within an hour and bringing most of the village with him, the ponies began to fervently search the village, putting out whatever fires they could and breaking down doors and windows wherever they could, desperately trying to find any survivors.\nThey found nothing, only burned corpses and dessicated husks.

As it was though, the alternatives looked grim.\n"I don't see how we can keep this going without doing something drastic," Starlight sighed as she poured over the latest reports. The initiative was everything for them right now, but without resources, they couldn't keep it.\n"And I can only pull rabbits out of my hat, not food for an army," Trixie agreed, slumping over the table as her disdain for paperwork finally took over. "Hey... should we make a grand show of "supporting the cause" and so? See how many donations we can get. Or heck, sell off the stuff in the museums to private collectors get money to buy whatever we can. It'll take some of the strain off at least"\n"That's not going to help, not enough," Starlight grimaced. "And there's then the question what we do when ponies' charity dry up. I can't believe I'm saying this, but we'll probably have to requisition what we need by force..."\n"You mean steal?" Trixie drawled.

They had seized tonnes of luxury items, mostly food, from all over the world. Trixie looked over the list as well, rolling her eyes at the sight, but then she grinned.\n"Tacky... but perfect! Remember how those nobleponies and industrialists in Manehattan? They weren't too happy with us after losing their fancy life. This is how we sort them out. Give them some of this stuff, treat them to a couple of nice dinners and give them a couple of new drapes or a sofa and they'll calm down and get more on our side!"\n"That's stupid," Starlight retorted. "This should go out among the average pony. Food shortages are already an issue. Are we seriously going to have fancy dinners while ponies go hungry?"\n"Do I need to remind you of our Saddle Arabia trip?" Trixie scoffed. "One haycake can't feed ten ponies. You'd be wasting it all instead of getting some actual use out of it. You know, a favor for a favor?"\n"It's about the message!" Starlight snapped. "What will the regular pony think when they see us sitting there, feasting while they hunger? We'd be giving the most to those who need the least when it should be the other way around!"\n"Oh here we go," Trixie rolled her eyes. "I knew you'd start paraphrasing Caramel Marks at some point. Do you want to make good use of this stuff or is it more important that everypony gets almost nothing instead of someponies something?!"\n"Maybe I'm trying to actually alleviate issues instead of coddling ponies whining about losing their third palace?!"

Now, as the changeling stranglehold over Equestria was being broken, there were obviously going to be ponies looking to settle the score...

Years?"\n"Well, what's your alternative? Say "please don't"?!"\n"How about putting an end to the killing?! If we have to enforce martial law and patrol the streets to stop the riots and lynchings, then that's what we'll do."\n"And pull soldiers off the front lines?" Trixie asked incredulously.

The nights that preceded the operation were exceedingly foggy, through the manipulations of collaborationist pegasi and Changeling magitech. The garrisons, who had exhibited such brutality in their policing of the past weeks, were strangely quiescent and docile, even as curfew-breaking Resistance members, emboldened by the obfuscating fog, engaged in petty skirmishes with Changeling checkpoints and patrols. For a while, it seemed that the suffocating mist that had descended on Fillydelphia and Albion both had revitalised the Resistance, the opaque veil of whiteness offering a cosy anonymity to dissidents and criminals alike.\nIn the weeks to follow, though, the ponies of the Resistance would be wishing that the dense, ephemeral fog they had grown to like would instead be replaced by the billowing clouds of Changeling tear gas deployed in Manehattan. Changeling jaegers, shrouded in riot gear and gas masks, preyed on anypony who dared stay out on the streets past the curfew. Often, the unlucky target would not see their pursuers' approach until they emerged wraith-like from the milky fog, swinging their trucheons. Plucky members of the Resistance checking in on safe houses and hideouts reported them missing their inhabitants, food half-eaten on the tables and the nebulous fog creeping in from opened windows. Ponies venturing outdoors at night courted the risk of being taken by the many Changeling snatch-squads lurking within the fog. Their families dreaded something else entirely - that something wearing the face of their loved ones would return home in their stead.\nNo members of the Central Resistance Committee in Albion have been seen for the past week, dead nor alive. In Fillydelphia, rumours abound of an absentee leadership clandestinely smuggled across the sea to Griffonia, leaving behind the shattered and demoralised remnants of a resistance. Paranoid and frightened, the squabbling residues of the Resistance begin to tear themselves apart in internecine witch hunts."

He held the paper close to his eyes, reading from it: "Namely, any noble who has taken the oath: 'I do solemnly swear that I will well and truly serve the Princesses of Equestria, and bear true allegiance to them.' Their collaboration is a clear violation of this oath, and they should thusly be stripped of their titles."\nNeon rose to her hooves immediately, counterargument at the ready: "The nobles secretly aided the resistance and took part in it, while appeasing the invader to stay alive. They did what they had to do for survival, all in true service of the Princesses."\n"And yet, we have evidence that several peers have collaborated for the sake of personal gain, and did nothing to help the resistance, thus betraying the Princesses. Your Honour, the Peerage is not a right. It is a privilege, and these ponies have violated its terms and conditions. I would therefore move for all those convicted to be stricken from the Peerage Roll, along with their descendants."\n"Does the defence have something to say?"\nNeon grabbed a piece of paper with her wing: We do, your Honour. The rules regarding the Peerage Roll strictly establish that it is for life. As such, it would be unlawful to do as Dotted Line suggests."\nDotted Line jumped to his hooves again: "And yet, the Code of Laws of Equestria shall always supersede any organizational rules or bylaws."\nThe argument went on for some more hours, until the judges retired for a vote."

"You know how the collaborators used their titles as a method of intimidation and how they used it to gain inroads with the changelings back under the occupation? We can have them declared tainted and a tool of crime, and have them dissolved, with any heirs declared 'naturally dead'."\n"'Naturally dead'?"

Looking out across the area, where the fields now reached for miles in every direction, where old traditions had been replaced with modern technology and where her old barn was replaced with a massive factory and office complex, she knew it was the right thing to do. This wasn't the Apple family's way of doing things, and whatever ponies said about her doing the right thing by expanding it so in order to make sure she could protect the workers there, she was still disgusted by it all.\n"Y'all happy?" she bitterly asked Flim and Flam who, as minority stakeholders, had also had to sign the farming complex. After all, she had been forced to beg for them to aid her. Their machines, their ideas, had helped her make all this, and they had won between the two. Once she had managed to hold onto the proper way of doing things, but now she had had to twist herself into this.\n"Do you hear that dear brother?" Flim asked. "She thinks we're happy? Dear miss Applejack, neither my brother nor I have any idea what you are going on about. You think we are HAPPY about all this?"\n"What is there to be happy about?" Flam continued. "The way you tied up the majority of the profits of this project in workers' bonuses and redevelopment? How you blindly refused to spray for bugs and instead waste space in the fields for beehives and bat lairs?!"\n"How you built in all these inefficient rules for "labor protection"" Flim yelled. "And not to mention your ridiculous waste management system! And even then all the things we come up with to get an edge are revealed to the world when you insist on open-book accounting, so all of our trade secrets fly straight out of the window!"\n"Are we expected to be happy about that?!" Flam concluded incredulously. "The single most promising venture in all of Equestria, and it's all boiled down to some ridiculous, feelgood cooperative! And what's worse, this is going to set the precedent for the future of Equestrian farming, meaning you've ruined the entire damn market!"

MAN_ELF_new.232.d:0 "One fact stands painfully clear to all Equestrians, no matter their political leanings. That is that the pacifistic policies of the old Equestria no longer works. Whatever may happen, the Magic of Friendship no longer holds the sway it used to do, and Equestria must now find a way to defend itself by arms when words fail.\nTrixie Lulamoon has advocated for keeping a clear line between civilian and military life, proposing that the Equestrian military should be kept strictly voluntary and receive the best possible training and support so that "the great and powerful" are entrusted with this duty. Though Equestria must arm itself to keep itself secure, militarism should not permeate the society overall. If total war once again strikes the nation, there should be systems in place to rally the population as needed, but until this happens the skeleton of Equestria's military should be made up by a highly trained, highly motivated core of elites.\nPrince Blueblood has instead proposed a system along Griffonian lines, where war is "nationalized" and it is the duty of every citizen to fight as the nation requires. Every citizen of Equestria enjoys the fruits of the nation, and therefore they should also be entrusted with the duty of defending it. It is expected of an Equestrian citizen to pay taxes and to obey the law after all. If war comes, fighting to defend this nation is a duty similar in nature. Beyond this, this is also a chance for the nation to instill good values in the conscripts that serve the nation and thus ensure that whether from Trottingham or Stableside, they will all be united in fighting for their homeland."

MAN_ELF_new.233.t:0 "The Future of the Peerage"
MAN_ELF_new.233.d:0 "A highly controversial proposal has been motioned in the Assembly, and the debates have raged on the topic for quite a while. During the occupation, many members of the nobility engaged in collaboration with the Changeling occupiers, and in several cases, were vital to their efforts of maintaining control. This has raised the issue of whether the noble institutions should be abolished, a notion championed by Starlight Glimmer.\nIn a speech before the Assembly, she read of several instance of this, stopping just short of referring to it as treason, and wrapping her speech up by asking whether Equestria should accept this kind of power and influence invested in a small, undemocratic clique who seemed to have more reasons of maintaining their own status instead of working for the good of the nation.\nBlueblood objected to the notion, pointing out that other collaborators existed as well, yet nothing had been said of revoking the rights of local communities' rights to for example logging, or whether to imprison the laborers who had worked under the changelings. And why would it? After all, it was a preposterous notion. It was however no more preposterous than to punish the entirety of Equestria's peerage for the actions of a few.\nStarlight answered that the issue lay first and foremost in the undue power invested in them, something that ran contrary to the notions that all ponies should stand as equals. The title-holders wielded greater power, and thus would have to be held to higher standards, much like bumping into someone while walking did not lead to prosecution, but hitting someone with a car would.\nHow high should those standards be, then, Blueblood asked. By such logic, was not every noble who did not instantly refuse to cooperate even on pain of death guilty? Their titles and status were part of their families' legacy, just like an inherited home, or a particular penchant for magic. The end goal could not be to slant the law against the successful, or the fortunate, yet what was what her proposal would lead to.\nAfter hours of debate, the Assembly was called to vote and the results are read out."

MAN_ELF_new.234.d:0 "What had started as an issue raised by Golden Delicious regarding the workers' co-ops of Baltimare quickly escalated into a massive debate regarding how Equestria should approach the issue of economic policy. As has become normal, Starlight Glimmer and Trixie Lulamoon on one hoof and Prince Blueblood on the other have lined up to debate the issue.\nThe Duumviirs, supportive of Golden Delicious, has argued for a policy of encouraging a decentralized economy built less around maximizing production and more around maximizing utility for the people. In this program, workers' co-ops, worker-owned industries and semi-autarky would be central words, with the end goal that each region of Equestria should be able to be self-sufficient and thus avoid the creation of huge companies that would end up wielding undue political influence.\nBlueblood questioned this view, stating that Equestria might be self-sufficient but that this was not a reason for it to close its doors to the world. Rather, it should aim to use its immense resources and the ingenuity of its ponies to establish itself as one of the top players of the global economy. The world is out there, and the more Equestria influences it economically, the safer it will be. If Equestria should work towards anything, it should not be autarky, but global economic dominance."

MAN_ELF_new.235.d:0 "Though the gentle hoof principle of the Celestia era was highly appreciated, there is a point where a hooves off approach becomes outright apathy. The later parts of the era's use of the Elements of Harmony as a method of tracking down and dealing with whatever threatened Equestria's Harmony provided much needed relief, this method will not be sufficient any longer. Princess Twilight will have too much to deal with in the day-to-day affairs of the nation, and the torch must pass to other ponies.\nOnce, a replacement would have been chosen at the princess' discretion among the ponies of Equestria. Yet the duty towards the nation is no longer a matter of a honour bestowed on a select few, but the fundamental right and privilege of all ponies. To that end an organization has been proposed to serve as a replacement for the princess and her friend, and the question has arisen regarding what its focus should be.\nStarlight Glimmer, with backing from Golden Delicious, has proposed that it should be focused on the social welfare and harmony of the Equestrian people, pointing to how many local problems that started out as local issues such as the Appleloosa crisis, the Hoofield-McColt dispute and all manner of issues where the local ponies were not able to solve them before they grew into larger issues.\nOn the other side of the spectrum stands Blueblood with support from Fancy Pants and Neighsay, who willingly admits that those contributions were helpful for the nation, but that the looming threat of invasion and foreign interference must take precedence. The Commission should instead analyze and coordinate efforts abroad to aid in the spread of harmonic ideals and support regimes that would not threaten Equestria."

Her fellow candidate Trixie Lulamoon has pledged to take over the role of acting party leader while Starlight serves as Prime Minister.\nEspousing a program that blends traditional Equestrian values of harmony and openness with moderate socialist ideas of workers' emancipation and empowerment, Starlight has sought to create a harmonious middle ground between two powerful forces in Equestria's politics. Together, the ponies of Equestria can build a new world that addresses the issues that existed in the past even as it keeps that which made Equestria great. Many things will change from this day onward, but as the ponies of Equestria have proven in the war of liberation, there is nothing they can't do when they come together."

Unlike Starlight Glimmer, he has been firm in his view that Equestria does not have to change, it has to be defended. The era did not end because of political failings, but because of a pacifism that drifted into apathy. It stirred itself awake too late, but now it is once again standing strong, and this time they will not forget. The good old Equestria still lives and will endure until the end of time."

MAN_ELF_new.238.d:0 "With the affirmation of the right of all Equestrians to organize themselves and stand in the parliament as the elected voice of the nation, parties have begun to spring up all over. In the future, there may well be no telling what coalitions arise, but as it stands, four major factions have emerged.\nThe first is the "All-Equestrian Caucus of Democratic Socialist Parties". Unlike their fellow Stalliongradian socialists, this party has solemnly sworn to respect and stand by the democratic process. They are led by Golden Delicious, a veteran of the Baltimare Socialist scene who has insisted on not being titled "party leader", but simply "speaker". They are still committed to transforming society along socialist lines, but it will be done by ballot and not bullet.\nSecondly stands the "Alliance for the Revival of Order, Tradition, and Prosperity", headed by Fancy Pants. With strong support amongst the upper class in particular, they are arguing for restoring and maintaining the old social hierarchy. While their popular support is minor, they nevertheless hold a lot of influence. A smaller, more radical faction under Chancellor Neighsay has also risen within the party, though for now the two ponies' ideals are in harmony.\nBetween these two groups stands "Her Majesty's Most Loyal Coalition for Progress and Harmony", which is made up from the core of the Liberation Front's Unity Government. With the war having ended, the unity government has split down the middle, with two factions vying for dominance. Starlight Glimmer has stated her intent to stand as Prime Minister in the new government, and they has received Golden Delicious' backing in this as well as the support of her former co-Duumviir Trixie Lulamoon, who has chosen to not enter the leadership race. On the other end, Prince Blueblood has made his own bid for the position of leadership. While he does not have Starlight's immense credibility from the war, his position, dignified rhetoric and contacts among the upper crust of Equestria along with Fancy Pants' backing has nevertheless made him a potential contender.\nFor now, the two ponies will co-lead the party, and the Princess chosen to not appoint one by decree. Instead she has suggested that they cooperate within parliament, bringing forth their policies and letting the parliament judge which is the most beneficial to Equestria."

MAN_ELF_new.239.d:0 ""What do you say?" Rarity asked as Blueblood looked in the mirror at his new ensemble. He had opted for a more modern suit which seemed almost stark compared to the old formal wear. Still, he liked it. It had a faintly military cut to it, and though it was made out of the finest materials it was still sturdy, which he appreciated as well. He truly had been lucky to get an appointment with Rarity on such short notice.\n"It is perfect," he told her. "Thank you. Was the first quote sufficient for this? It feels as though it would cost even more."\n"Oh please," Rarity scoffed. "A proper businessmare sticks to her prices. But tell me... where are you going now?" she asked him, a curious look on her face. "With all that has been, it feels as though you have barely sat still since you came back to Equestria. What will you do now?"\n"I..." Blueblood sighed, "I don't know," he admitted, looking wistfully off into the distance. "It was naive of me perhaps, but I could not help but envision - or maybe just hope - that my return to Equestria would have been glorious. I let everypony down in the first war, and I'm not arrogant to presume I "deserved" to do more in this conflict, but I still wish I could have. I will remain in the military for now. There is hopefully more I can do for Equestria. There has to be, otherwise I don't know what I'd do." He smiled sadly at her, chuckling. "My apologies, maudlin self-pity was hardly a fitting answer. For now I am taking a temporary leave of absence. I have much to think about, and I hope I will find answers. Thank you," he nodded to Rarity, who smiled back.\n"I hope that you find what you are looking for. Good luck." As Blueblood departed Rarity remained standing by the register, looking after him before her face slowly fell onto the table and she cursed under her breath, realizing what was happening. She didn't want it to, but it was happening. Why? Because she was the absolute worst..."

"Uuuugh."\n"I... wasn't going to say anything," Twilight remarked awkwardly. She had invited Starlight and Trixie over for tea, hoping to get a sense for how they were doing. Trixie was doing great, but it was clear that Starlight wasn't.\n"No, but it had to be said," Starlight drawled. "It's been annoying me ever since he got appointed, and everypony is walking around me like I'm made out of glass ever since."\n"Maybe you need to get away for a week or two?" Twilight suggested. "Celestia knows I've struggled to learn when to just relax."\n"Hey, that's a good idea!" Trixie agreed."Why not come with me on the road for a few weeks? What...?" she asked when seeing the look on Twilight's face. "I mean Starlight might be sticking around, but I'm not. All I ever wanted was to be a travelling magician. Now that this stupid war is over, the Great and Powerful Trixie can go back to doing what she actually wants to do."\n"Yeah, I'll come along," Starlight said, looking up from the table. "Will that Seneschal position you talked about still be available in two weeks?" she asked Twilight, who nodded.\n"I wouldn't dream of revoking it before you had a chance to rest."

They had lost so much, but they still stood strong, and even in this new world, where the common pony had to take the place of the tightly-knit group of heroic guardians she remembered, they could still defend themselves if need be.\nAnd yet, Twilight could only worry. She tried to put on a brave face, but it was hard, and she wasn't surprised when Starlight Glimmer asked her what was wrong.\n"Everything," she admitted as she began to pace around the throne room. "I don't know what I've missed, but it just feels like there is something more we have to do. The changelings who moved into Vanhoover during the occupation and are still there. What do we do with them? Applejack and so many others lost their properties and homes and won't ever get them back. So many among the population are still traumatized, and the issues just pile up. I don't know how we'll ever be done with all these issues."\n"That is because we won't," Starlight said plainly, coming up to Twilight's side as Twilight turned to stare at her. "It's something you learn when you've done things, or gone through them, that aren't fixed so easily," Starlight clarified. "You won't ever get to go back to how it was. You want to, but this is your life now, and you have to continue facing it. It won't ever be as good as it was before everything... but it can get better than it is. That's what you live for, because you can't ever get back that thing you lost." Starlight turned to Twilight after this, smiling wryly. "Also, you will end up doing insane things if you do try."\n"We're not flawless, we're a work in progress," Twilight mumbled to herself, sighing in the end. "It's just that the process never ends.

She was nervous, and Lilac could taste it.\nIt wasn't too surprising since what Vesapolis provided WAS nothing more than propaganda, much to Lilac's protests.

The soldiers all stand to attention, and the passing-out ceremony begins.\nLilac is full of pride as she watches the assorted ponies march past her podium. It had taken some convincing for the senior Ost-Kommando officer in charge of the ceremony to allow an all-pony unit to take pride of place at the front of the parade order, but in the end, the symbolic power of the act overrode any feelings of racial pride. Here in the East, far away from the stifling oversight of Vesalipolis, Lilac had finally accomplished what she had longed for ever since she had first stepped hoof in Manehattan: changelings and ponies, marching side by side with each other as comrades-in-arms - harbingers of a new era of peace, harmony, and friendship."

Relying on the Changeling army for defense, the start of the Equestrian War of Liberation had entailed the withdrawal of most of the southern garrison to fight at the front, and the power vacuum was quickly filled by a myriad of revolutionary organisations, local clans, roving bands of sheriffs, and even buffalo marauders. As the last changeling defenders within Appleloosa surrendered to the Equestrian vanguard, the ponies of the south are already planning for a future free from the Changeling yoke."

The Sun, Moon and Swords now flies high above the gambling city and though in many cases the casinos and amusement parks are damaged from the fighting, whatever can be safely open for the liberators has been."

cityfall.308.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader] As the Equestrian forces stormed the city of Ponyville, the last changeling resistance was dug in around the town hall, which sadly was reduced to ruins in the fighting. While not an industrial powerhouse, the propaganda value in retaking this city cannot be overstated. Despite its modest size, the city has long played an important role as the home of Princess Twilight Sparkle as well as the famous Mane Six, and to many ponies it is a symbol of the Equestrian heartlands. Despite the changeling repressions, the city also has kept bountiful food supplies, and the locals have gladly shared food and drink with their saviors both."

Even before the war, there was a changeling population in Vanhoover and the post-war occupation saw it grow explosively, rising to nearly a third of the population. Whatever peace that existed between the local changelings and ponies evaporated during the attack and when the city fell, the ELF was forced to deploy in force to prevent attacks on the changeling civilians. For now, the city is calm, even though the issue has not been settled."

So far, these clashes have been minor, with no deaths and the worst of it being broken windows and broken bones. But the possibility of petty street fighting turning into true general insurrection keeps our officers up at night."
MAN_scripted_loc_for_four_unique_uprising_event_texts_2:0 "What we thought was dockside griffon gangs vandalizing local structures has become something far worse. E.L.F symbology is everywhere, and no amount of propaganda can paint over this. A patrol of Constabulary were attacked while investigating the reports by well placed sniper fire, and then ambushed repeatedly as they fled back to their base. There were survivors, but their story swept away any relief at their survival. These were no gangbangers. They were drilled and zealous irregulars.

MAN_scripted_loc_for_four_unique_uprising_event_texts_4:0 "This is a disaster. This whole thing is an unmitigated disaster. The Protectress, whether through her own negligence or the Hegemony's failure to adequately supply her, has let the homegrown resistance go from a few dozen malcontents making up codes in someone's studio apartment to a wide-spread insurgency with perhaps a few thousand soldiers.\nThey are everywhere. They often go without uniforms or any marking of their allegiance, blending in perfectly with the populace. They were rumors once, but now they are undeniably real. Their agents firebomb our garrison outposts and make threats towards our collaborators. Even some of the Changeling settlers are becoming sympathetic, with reports of Thoraxian rhetoric now rampant among our imported hivemates. Things are not hopeless yet. But these problems require hard choices, sacrifice, and a degree of luck to solve. May Chrysalis, or indeed, Celestia, help us."

Unfortunately, by the time our wing of jaegers arrived to relieve them, the guerilla fighters had vanished along with sensitive intel and a VIP captive.\nEvery day, Manehattan rebels disrupt our activities and deny us easy access to our own territory. The collaborator bureaucracy fostered by the Protectress to help smooth out her administration is in shambles. The pony Constabulary is hemorrhaging personnel as deserters flee the city ahead of a certain rebel victory. Our loyal soldiers hold their fortifications as best they can, but even they begin to worry that salvation isn't coming."

The building was quickly consumed by flame, and with it the home and lives of hundreds.\nThe soldiers' names have not been released, and furious mobs hound the offices and garrisons of the Protectorate. Vigilantes bent on revenge lynch any Changeling or collaborationist unlucky enough to be caught out on the streets, and as news of the Changeling atrocity spreads across the Protectorate, so does the pony violence.\nLilac is furious, but even she is at a loss at how to proceed. Punish the officers? Because she can't find out a single Chrysalis-damned name! The idiots involved are being protected by their fellows and no one is talking.\nThe disciplinary action can wait for now.

## some more dev notes:
# the amount of divisions the ELF gets when they rise up is scaled to which level of "Resistance Subversion" MAN is at. The maximum is 44 divisions, same as if they rise up via CHN not releasing MAN. 
# the way the ELF's "Incite Uprising" action is supposed to be used is you wait until you have five uprisings prepared, then spawn them all in at once. Then you set them to garrison a few states, thus diverting CHN divisions away from the front and disrupting infrastructure.
# the way the ELF's "Install Civilian Administration" is supposed to be used is if there are other countries at war with CHN, where there is the possibility that they will take away ELF core states in the peace deal.

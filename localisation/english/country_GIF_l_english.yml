 GIF_trade_with_kompels_desc:0 "Since the arrival of the griffon Kompels centuries ago east of Twizanyika, the giraffes have enjoyed a friendly trade relationship with them, exchanging goods through the decades. As the Kompels slowly became the most industrialized nation on this part of Zebrica, Twizanyika experienced the arrival of industrial goods, for better or worse.

 ### Decisions ###
 
 GIF_dzinashi_coup:0 "The Plot"
 GIF_dzinashi_coup_desc:0 "High King Retikula, and especially the Twizanbwean dynasty, have proven that they have lost the capability to rule Twizanyika effectively. We have grown dependent on the griffons to the east, delaying our modernisation; and they have failed to protect their own capital from foreign raids, losing much wealth and prestige in the process. It is clear, that there is a need for a change in Twizanyika. And King Dzinashi III of Matanda is willing to be that change. He just needs to wait and slowly build his plot support - and then, strike."

 ### Leaders ###
 
 GIF_high_king_retikula_ii:0 "High King Retikula II"
 GIF_high_king_retikula_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of February, 952, in Twizanbwe.\n\n§YBiography§!: Retikula was born as the first child of the Twizanbwean King, and by consequence the High King of Twizanyika, Samhuri III. Taking his grandfather's name, the young Retikula was raised as a calf to be the perfect example of Twizanbwe's traditions and prestige over the rest of the giraffe Kingdoms. He was taught the basics and the advanced arts of combat necking; the history of Twizanyika and Twinzanbwe; the matters of administration; and how to be a faithful giraffe of the Gods Ivhu and Zuva.\n\nWhen his father died in 978 ALB, Retikula ascended to the Great Twizanbwe's throne as High King Retikula II, vowing to embody the same traditions and beliefs he had been raised in. Retikula's rule was peaceful and uneventful for the first decade or so, as Twizanyika prospered from trade and the rest of the Twizanyikan Kingdoms were under the rule of friendly or neutral monarchs. But when one of the Storm King's generals raided Twizanbwe in 1002 ALB, everything took a turn for the chaotic. A large portion of the city's gold and luxuries were pillaged by the raiders, and Great Twizanbwe's walls were damaged by the attackers.\n\nRetikula has now the spent the last years steering the High Kingdom's repair efforts, and dealing with the damaged prestige and stolen wealth his lands have suffered. Most recently, he has called a meeting of the Grand Council of Twizanyika, where the four monarchs of the giraffes all meet to discuss and agree on the affairs and actions of the High Kingdom. Retikula is trying to use this as a catalyst for change in Twizanyika, as the recent experiences have convinced the giraffe that the country must modernise and industralize in the coming years if Twizanyika were to have a future as an independent nation.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

 GIF_mutsipa_name:0 "Tinevimbo"
 
 ### Focuses ###
 
 GIF_first_tree_begin:0 "Convene The Grand Council"
 GIF_first_tree_begin_desc:0 "With the year 1007 just beginning, High King Retikula has convened the Grand Council of Twizanyika's monarchs. There are many issues that need to be dealt with, and fast."
 GIF_visit_zuvera:0 "A Visit To Zuvera"
 GIF_visit_zuvera_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Zuvera has always been, and always will be, Twizanbwe's most faithful ally in Twizanyika. In order to strengthen this historic friendship, and to keep our support in the Council, a visit to queen Kudzaishe in Zuvera is in good order."
 GIF_the_coal_issue:0 "The Coal Problem"
 GIF_the_coal_issue_desc:0 "Recently, large deposits of coal have been found by Zuveran miners in the foothills of the Gurnam mountains. While historically we haven't had much use for it, coal is a vital resource needed to power up industry. Trade-minded giraffes have proposed an export deal to the Kompels, while detractors argue it will only increase our dependence on the griffons."
 GIF_talk_with_the_guilds:0 "A Meeting With The Guilds"
 GIF_talk_with_the_guilds_desc:0 "The stonemason and architect guilds of Zuvera are amongst the most powerful and prestigious of Twizanyika. More than a century ago, they helped to build the wonders of Great Twizanbwe, and today continue to supply our nation will experienced and capable giraffes. High King Retikula has decided that a meeting with them would be good - perhaps they would help to restore Twizanbwe, as their ancestors did many years ago."
 GIF_the_military_issue:0 "Patch Up The Military Issue"
 GIF_the_military_issue_desc:0 "The recent experiences with Boltrus' raid as well as the news of conflicts elsewhere in Zebrica and the world have shown that our military is incapable of fighting a modern war. Or rather, our militaries. Twizanyika lacks a centralized fighting force, instead relying on the armies of its individual Kingdoms. Some giraffes have proposed changing this, but to traditionalists' anger, of course."
 GIF_new_walls:0 "Repair The Walls"
 GIF_new_walls_desc:0 "While we have made good progress on repairing the walls of Great Twinzanbwe in the last years, the truth is that it is taking too long - and this has hurt our prestige immensely. But no more. With a final push of extra workers and funding, we will finally finish repairing the walls of our capital and restore them to even better conditions that they had in 1002."
 GIF_new_gold_rush:0 "A New Gold Rush?"
 GIF_new_gold_rush_desc:0 "Our surveyors in the Kuchamhembe mountains have come back with the report of more gold deposits deeper underground. While this would do well to fill our treasury back and cover costs, there are concerns that it working there would be too unsafe for the miners. In the end, High King Retikula will have to decide whether to exploit this opportunity or not."
 GIF_new_uses_land:0 "Repurposing Pillaged Land"
 GIF_new_uses_land_desc:0 "While on his path entering and leaving Twizanyika, Boltrus also took the opportunity to plunder the few villages and towns he encountered on his way. These lands now remain empty, as their inhabitants had fled from their homes before and after Boltrus came. With this in mind, a debate has emerged in Twizanyika on the use of these lands, which Retikula will need to settle."
 GIF_a_new_temple:0 "The New Temple"
 GIF_a_new_temple_desc:0 "With our push to repair Twizanbwe almost done, the time for the greatest task to be done is here. Twizanbwe's Temple, a grand testament to the prestige of the city's dynasty and the Gods, will also be given an extra workforce push in order to finish its restoration. Once this is done, Twinzanbwe will be great once again."
 GIF_visit_musangano:0 "Visiting Musangano"
 GIF_visit_musangano_desc:0 "The city of Musangano lies to the east, on the confluence of the Goridhe and Gungwa rivers. It is the capital of the eponymous Kingdom, which historically has been seen as the 'lesser' of Twizanyika's monarchies. However in the last decades it has prospered due to the trade with the Kompels, and so it is fitting that Retikula would make a visit to Queen Rungano and her lands."
 GIF_the_new_crops:0 "Talk With The Landowners"
 GIF_the_new_crops_desc:0 "The landowning giraffes of Musangano have gained quite a fame in the last years for pioneering new crops beyond the traditional acacia orchards, even gaining the support of Queen Rungano for this. While this is fine, some acacia farmers and landowners have grumbled at this, claiming to be replaced. Maybe it is time for Retikula to take a look at this and mediate?"
 GIF_crime_border:0 "The Revai Trial"
 GIF_crime_border_desc:0 "The trial of Revai ye Yero, a minor noble inside Musangano, has divided his native Kingdom for the last few months. What was initially a local matter quickly turned into a national one as the giraffe's trial became an even more political and divisive matter. Seeking an end of this, Retikula's ruling has been invoked - the High King will now have to decide and take a stance in this matter."
 GIF_discuss_with_matanda:0 "Discuss With Dzinashi"
 GIF_discuss_with_matanda_desc:0 "The King of Matanda, Twizanbwe's historical rival, has become more of a worry in the last months. Rumours have it that he's plotting against Retikula's rule, seeking to topple him from power. The High King has decided to take matters into his own hooves, and requested Dzinashi's presence in neutral ground to discuss matters. "
 GIF_adjourn_the_council:0 "Adjourn The Grand Council"
 GIF_adjourn_the_council_desc:0 "The more urgent matters of the last months have been taken care off to some extent, and Twizanbwe is now fully repaired. With this done, we can finally hold a final meeting of the Grand Council, to adjourn it for the year."
 
 ## Retikula
 
 GIF_high_king_triumphant:0 "The High King Triumphant"
 GIF_high_king_triumphant_desc:0 "High King Retikula has emerged from any potential troubles against his reign victorious. Now, the High King can freely put in motion the reform and modernization programs he and his advisors have drafted for a better, more prosperous Twizanyika."
 GIF_reward_the_zuverans:0 "Reward The Zuverans"
 GIF_reward_the_zuverans_desc:0 "Through perhaps the darkest hours in the history of the Twizanbwean dynasty, the giraffes of Zuvera haven't abandoned us. Instead, they choose to once again support us against Matanda, as their ancestors did. It is clear such loyalty deserves a reward."
 GIF_punish_the_matandans:0 "Punish The Matandans"
 GIF_punish_the_matandans_desc:0 "Once again the Kingdom of Matanda has gone to war against Twizanbwe, the hegemon of Twizanyika. And once again they have lost. It is clear that the Matandan giraffes need to be further limited, so they may never raise a hoof against us and threaten Twizanyina ever again."
 GIF_deal_with_musangano:0 "Deal With Musangano"
 GIF_deal_with_musangano_desc:0 "Instead of picking a side, the cowardly giraffes of Musangano have once again declared their pledge for their 'neutrality'. Twizanyika must be united, and such de-facto secession will not be tolerated. Either they will submit as they did before, or face the consequences."
 GIF_high_king_consolidates:0 "Consolidate Retikula's Position"
 GIF_high_king_consolidates_desc:0 "Any immediate threats to the High King's rule have been dealt with, and there is peace in Twizanyika. Now, Retikula looks to implement his program to bring the country into the modern age."
 GIF_intensify_centralization:0 "Greater Centralization"
 GIF_intensify_centralization_desc:0 "Twizanyika's political system has always been centralized, with the Twizanbwean monarch holding absolute power in any final decision-making in the High Kingdom. However, recent events have shown Retikula that this is not enough, and a factor for further chaos. It is clear, that in order for Twizanyika to survive, it must be centralized further."
 GIF_promote_bakatwa:0 "Promote Bakatwa To Grand Marshal"
 GIF_promote_bakatwa_desc:0 "Upenyu Bakatwa, the commander of the Twizanbwean Royal Guard, and trusted friend of the High King; has shown himself to be compentent and skilled at military matters, as he led Twizanbwe's army together with the High King to defeat Dzinashi and his revolt. It is clear that a promotion to commander of all Twizanyikan Armies is more than deserved."
 GIF_only_one_treasury:0 "Abolish The Treasuries"
 GIF_only_one_treasury_desc:0 "Despite the monopoly of the gold trade in Twizanyika by the Twizanbwean dynasty dating back to the ninth century ALB, the other Kingdoms were still permitted to maintain their own independent treasuries. But not more. Under Retikula's centralization reforms, all treasuries in Twizanyika will be brought under Twizanbwean control."
 GIF_shuffle_advisors:0 "Shuffle Advisors"
 GIF_shuffle_advisors_desc:0 "Despite his final decision-making powers, the High King has always had a group of advisors and other giraffes around him in order to better judge the decisions made on the High Kingdom. With the near collapse of Twizanyika however, the incompentency of some of these advisors has been shown. Retikula has consequently decided to shuffle and fire the most incapable of them."
 GIF_zuvas_blessing:0 "With Zuva's Blessing"
 GIF_zuvas_blessing_desc:0 "It is clear, that through the vast deposits of gold found inside it, and the proud history of its giraffes; that the Twizanbwean dynasty has been blessed by Zuva, Goddess of the Sun. This of course means that the dynasty's power is divine and that the word of the High King is absolute, for it comes from the Gods themselves."
 GIF_abolish_the_kingdoms:0 "Legally Abolish The Kingdoms"
 GIF_abolish_the_kingdoms_desc:0 "The autonomy of the Twizanyikan Kingdoms has been curtailed for the last weeks. Yet, it is clear that this is still not enough, for any sort of power being given to them could mean a revolt in the future. Retikula has come to the decision that the Kingdoms must be abolished, politically and legally, so this never happens again."
 GIF_retikula_reform_the_country:0 "Reform The System"
 GIF_retikula_reform_the_country_desc:0 "Despite the almost smooth adjourning of the Grand Council, the truth is that large bloodshed was avoided just by a hair. We must involve themselves in a reform of the Twizanyikan system so the High Kingdom never falls into near-chaos ever again."
 GIF_reform_the_grand_council:0 "A New Grand Council"
 GIF_reform_the_grand_council_desc:0 "The Grand Council of Twizanyika has stood as a testament to the High Monarch's power for centuries, as its voice was final, and overuled even the other monarchs when issues were voted on. However, it has been made obvious that the Council does not attend the demands of the modern Twizanyika. Consequently, it will be expanded with new members from wider society."
 GIF_a_council_in_every_kingdom:0 "A Council In Every Kingdom"
 GIF_a_council_in_every_kingdom_desc:0 "The Grand Council is an institution unique to Twizanyika as a whole, with the other Kingdoms having their own systems; giving more or less power to their monarch depending only of the wishes of that monarch. However, the members of the Grand Council have agreed that similar Councils must be set up in every Kingdom, to better organize the reforms in Twizanyika."
 GIF_a_military_council:0 "Unite The Armies"
 GIF_a_military_council_desc:0 "Each Twizanyikan Kingdom operates its own military, independent from the rest, and with its own leadership and chain of command. It has served us well historically, but is now hopelessly outdated for the modern era. Thus, an official proposal to unite all Twizanyikan armies into one command has been approved by the Grand Council."
 GIF_economic_unity:0 "Unite The Treasuries"
 GIF_economic_unity_desc:0 "Similarly, all Twizanyikan monarchies have their own treasuries and, despite some centralization in regards to the gold trade and prices by the Twizanbwean dynasty, operate independently. In order to effectivize our coming reforms of Twizanyika, the High King has decided to approve a proposal that would create a Grand Treasury for the High Kingdom."
 GIF_the_twizanyika_charter:0 "The Twizanyikan Charter"
 GIF_the_twizanyika_charter_desc:0 "The High King and the expanded Grand Council have been at work reforming Twizanyika for the last weeks. Now, it is time to finally put forward Retikula's magnum opus: an official document detailing the responsibilities of each estate of the Twizanyikan state and society - a great step forward for Twizanyika!"
 GIF_retikula_please_trad_1:0 "Meet The Traditionalists"
 GIF_retikula_please_trad_1_desc:0 "It has come to the High King's attention that several more conservative and traditionalist giraffes are still displeased over the his decisions, causing some unrest within the country. This cannot stand as long as we want to reform the country, so Retikula has decided to meet these giraffes to calm them down."
 GIF_retikula_please_trad_2:0 "Hold A Festival"
 GIF_retikula_please_trad_2_desc:0 "In order to please the conservative giraffes, the High King has called for a festival to be held in the capital city of Twizanbwe - inviting many traditional dancers; singers; and other cultural displays into it. Including, of course, the combat necking events. This will do much to show these giraffes that we still care about Twizanbwe's heritage."
 GIF_retikula_please_trad_3:0 "Send Them Some Gifts"
 GIF_retikula_please_trad_3_desc:0 "When all else fails, it is clear that there is nothing some gold and gifts can't fix. The High King has decided to send some lavish presents to the more prominent giraffes that are still displeased at his rule, so they finally accept it. It will cost us some, but it'll be worth it in the end."
 GIF_nation_building:0 "Forge Twizanyikan Unity"
 GIF_nation_building_desc:0 "Despite the existence of the High Kingdom, it is clear that the Twizanyikan giraffes lack a defining national identity; despite our unity in faith, language, and race; more giraffes are more loyal to their local communities or Kingdoms than to the concept of Twizanyika as a country. If we are to be a modern nation, this must change."

 GIF_bakatwa_doctrine_desc:0 "Upenyu Bakatwa, the High King's most trusted military commander, has proposed an interesting doctrine for the Twizanyikan army to base itself on: one of superior firepower, and artillery. This will require industrial and research development, but Bakatwa promises Retikula that it will build a more capable army in the future."
 GIF_bakatwa_support:0 "Artillery Development"
 GIF_bakatwa_support_desc:0 "Concurrent with our adoption of the Bakatwa doctrine, the High King has signed a decree that will increase the funding for artillery research in Twizanyika.

 GIF_zvakaipa_doctrine_desc:0 "Fadzai Zvakaipa, the commander of the Zuveran Royal Guard, proposed to us the doctrine which the united Twizanyikan army should use: one of centralized military command, and a defensive focus. This proposal appeals to Retikula's desire for a centralized army command, but is certainly less interesting than Bakatwa's proposal."
 GIF_zvakaipa_support:0 "Support The Giraffe"
 GIF_zvakaipa_support_desc:0 "Central to Zvakaipa's doctrine is the development of specialised support equipment for our soldiers. Shovels; explosives; helmets; and other such equipment are vital for the functioning of any modern army and so it is necessary for us to invest into the research of these technologies."
 GIF_gun_development:0 "Beyond The Musket"
 GIF_gun_development_desc:0 "Lastly, our military commanders have come to the same conclusion: Twizanyika's current main rifle, based on Kompel musket designs from the 800's, are woefully outdated compared to those of other nations. If we are to defend our country in the future, then we must rapidly adopt a modern service rifle for our soldiers."

 GIF_recruitment_spree_desc:0 "There are no shortage of giraffes willing to volunteer to serve Twizanyika.

 GIF_defend_twizanyika_desc:0 "The barriers that have held giraffes back from defending our land for so long have to be torn down. Twizanbwean; Musanganan; Zuveran and Matandan - we are all Twizanyikans. And all giraffes must defend their nation."
 GIF_twizanbwe_military:0 "Twizanbwe's Leadership"
 GIF_twizanbwe_military_desc:0 "For the past centuries, the Kingdom of Twizanbwe has been the prime monarchy amongst the ones making up the High Kingdom.

 GIF_centralized_command_desc:0 "Zvakaipa's ideas of a centrally-planned military command, headquartered from Twizanbwe, are of interest to the High King and his advisors.

 GIF_internal_police:0 "Found The Kudzivirira"
 GIF_internal_police_desc:0 "In the future, we can't risk any new threats of internal revolt in the High Kingdom, for it would have dreadful consequences to Twizanyika.

 GIF_modern_walls:0 "The New Walls"
 GIF_modern_walls_desc:0 "Twizanbwe's walls are one of the cities' most famous - perhaps the most famous - features. Designed by the Zuveran giraffes, it is one of the greatest symbols of their knowledge and friendship. Yet, these walls can also be improved, and adapted, for the modern age. And that we will do."
 GIF_defensive_schemes:0 "Defensive Schemes"
 GIF_defensive_schemes_desc:0 "Of course, a specialty in constructing walls and other such structures comes with a focus on defensive doctrine.

 GIF_musangano_military:0 "Musangano's Advantage"
 GIF_musangano_military_desc:0 "Despite its small size, Musangano has become the most technologically advanced of the Twizanyikan Kingdoms in general, thanks to its border with the Kompel griffons to the east. Consequently, their advancements will help us construct an effective Twizanyikan military."

 GIF_musangano_hospitals_desc:0 "Many soldiers perish in the field, prey to injuries or conditions that could be easily treated with more adept equipment - and it is clear that we need to correct this immediately.

 GIF_new_palace:0 "A New Royal Palace"
 GIF_new_palace_desc:0 "Twizanbwe's Royal Palace is rightly the largest single building in the entirety of the High Kingdom, hosting a number of institutions and functions necessary for the High King to rule. However, it has begun to age in the recent years, and so the spirit of reform initiated by Retikula makes it the perfect time to renovate it."
 GIF_create_buraucracy:0 "A National Bureaucracy"
 GIF_create_buraucracy_desc:0 "In order to make the day-to-day running of the more centralized High Kingdom easier, it is necessary for a national bureaucracy to be created. Previously, this was a small force, as each Kingdom was very autonomous. However, the centralization of the country makes it impossible to sustain this, and so we must enact a wide reform of our administration."

 GetGIFReligiousHeadDesc_con:0 "The position of High King has always been associated with a degree of divinity authority in it, ever since the reign of Queen Nyika II.

 GIF_civilationism_desc:0 "Twizanyika, and the High Kingdom, are more than a simple country; or nation. It is the expression of an unified giraffe race, united to defend their home. Under Zuva and Ivhu's grace, this will forever be true. Else, we will perish."

 GIF_start_economy:0 "Forge An Economy"
 GIF_start_economy_desc:0 "With our affairs - mostly - in order, it is time we look at one of the more pressing concerns Twizanyika faces: that of modernisation. Boltrus' raid has shown us that we cannot keep sustaining our current economic model. If we do, we'll surely be defeated by another invader in the future."
 GIF_import_tools:0 "Import Excavation Tools"
 GIF_import_tools_desc:0 "For the longest time, Twizanbwe's pride and wealth came from its famous gold mines.

 GIF_start_literacy:0 "Educate The Giraffes"
 GIF_start_literacy_desc:0 "Twizanyika's social system has always been hierarchical, with most giraffes spending their lives working on the land of those with higher - literally - status. While this system has served us well, Retikula recognizes that in order to become a modern nation, we must reform. Initiating a literacy program for the common giraffe will be the start of this."
 GIF_temple_school:0 "Fund Religious Schools"

 GIF_agricultural_tools_desc:0 "Our economy is vastly agricultural, as a great majority of giraffes work in the farms and rural lands through Twizanyika. Yet, they mostly use outdated tools, or even no tools at all. This makes our production inefficient, and so it is necessary to import and develop improved agricultural tools."
 GIF_working_regulations:0 "The Twizanyikan Statute"
 GIF_working_regulations_desc:0 "As our economy develops and slowly industrializes, the question of the status of the workers is becoming more of an issue.

 ### Events ###
 
 twizanyika.1.t:0 "The Opening Of The Grand Council"
 twizanyika.1.d:0 "Unlike the many other years the High King of Twizanyika invoked a meeting of the nation's Grand Council, this time this proclamation did not involve much show. In the last weeks, the distinct monarchs of the High Kingdom had received simple letters, with only the light-red stamping signifying the Royal Seal of Twizanyika on it, telling them that High King Retikula II had convened the Grand Council in Twizanbwe.\n\nAnd so it was. First to arrive was Kudzaishe VII, the Queen of Zuvera, Twinzanbwe's historical ally through Twizanyikan history. Kudzaishe also arrived with a group of Zuveran architects, eager to work on the restoration project of the capital's Temple. The Queen's arrival was met with much enthusiasm from the city's inhabitants, as her entourage passed through the still-damaged commercial centre of the city. Entering the High King's residence, she was given a warm welcome by Retikula and his family alike, and both High King and Kudzaishe talked and discussed privately for many hours about the current state of Twizanyika, and the world at large.\n\nSecond to arrive was Rungano V, the Queen of Musangano, committed to upholding her Kingdom's reputation of neutrality and status-quo upholding. Though it is the less prestigious of the four Kingdoms, Musangano has prospered in the last years as trade with the griffon Kompels to the east increased in quantity. With her entourage came a group of Musangano's top merchants, wearing extravagant golden rings around their necks and legs, who months before vowed to invest more of their money into Twizanbwe's reconstruction efforts. Retikula met with these giraffes, thanking them for their investment promise, before also privately discussing with Queen Rungano; the giraffe particulary concerned about the future of Twizanyika's trade partnership with the Vrystaat.\n\nLast to come was Dzinashi III, the King of Matanda, Twizanbwe's historical rival. Unlike the other monarchs, Dzinashi did not arrive with any other entourage; instead only being escorted by a detachment of Matanda's Royal Guard, wearing simple ceremonial dressings. Dzinashi arrived and discussed shortly with Retikula, before both giraffes left for the Grand Council's meeting.\n\nThe issues that face Twizanyika are many at the moment: the issue of the trade with the Kompels, repairing Twizanbwe, and a myriad of other problems normally not important; but with the current political situation they now take the front seat in the giraffes' discourse. It is clear that this Grand Council meeting will perhaps be the most important in decades, if not the entire history of Twizanyika."
 twizanyika.1.a:0 "There's so much to do..."
 
 twizanyika.2.t:0 "A Visit To Zuvera"
 twizanyika.2.d:0 "One of High King Retikula's first locations to visit in Twizanyika was, of course, the Kingdom of Zuvera. Both Twinzanbwe and Zuvera had an historic alliance between each other, dating back even before what is traditionally thought as the beginning of this friendship - that is Zuvera's support of Twizanbwe in the war against Matanda in 803 ALB.\n\nThis alliance instead had its first origins a hundred or so years before that, when two high-ranking members of each dynasty married each other. From there, Zuvera's famous stonemasons woud lay the foundations of what would become Great Twizanbwe two hundred years later. In return, the Twizanbweans rewarded the Zuverans greatly for their support, granting them land from Matanda and giving them second preference in the gold trade - which had been monopolized by Twizanbwe following the unification of the giraffes in 803 ALB. This partnership continues to this day, seemingly unbreakable.\n\nThis was even more reaffirmed by Retikula's visit to Zuvera. As the High King and his entourage travelled from Twizanbwe and down the Gungwa River towards his destination, he passed by several towns and villages along the way, the giraffes living in them not wasting their perhaps once-in-a-lifetime chance of seeing the High King of Twizanyika.\n\nAs the High King entered the city, he was met with much fanfare, from either its inhabitants or Zuvera's Royal Guard. Queen Kudzaishe welcomed Retikula, before treating him and his entourage with a lavish lunch. Following this, both monarchs attended the city's stadium for the Combat Necking events; hoof-picked by Retikula to be held on this day, as he is a fan of the sport. The matches were preceded by a joint parade between the Zuveran and Twizanbwean Royal Guards, accompanied by traditional dancers and singers. The highlight of this was when the Twizanbweans put their twelve bronze cannons on full display, using them to end the ceremony with a bang.\n\nAt night, a great dinner was held, attended by a large number of important giraffes and nobles. The Guild heads, particulary, were interested in meeting the High King personally; which he accepted at a later date. Near the end of the dinner, the High King raised a cup full of imported Aquileian wine, and cleared his throat - bringing the entire party's attention. Then, he began to speak, and proclaimed:"
 twizanyika.2.a:0 "To an historic friendship!"
 
 twizanyika.3.t:0 "Resolving The Coal Problem"
 twizanyika.3.d:0 "One of the most important matters brought into debate for the last few months in Twizanyika was the discovery of several coal deposits in Zuvera's mountains. While historically we didn't have much use for coal, it is know that this resource is vital for the proper development and function of not only factories; but railroads and furnaces, amongst other machinery - all which our griffon neighbours to the east use to an extent.\n\nNaturally, this has brought up the question: what should we do? A faction, led by Queen Rungano of Musangano, propose that we should authorize the extraction of the coal; not only to export to the Kompels and increase our trade profits, but also to power the future factories of Twizanyika, according to Rungano. However, a second faction led mostly by traditionalists instead says that exploiting this coal will only increase our dependence to the Vrystaat, eventually surrendering our economic sovereignty to them.\n\nGiven he has absolute power over the final decisions in the Grand Council, what will Retikula choose?"
 twizanyika.3.a:0 "Authorize the extraction of the coal."
 twizanyika.3.b:0 "They are right, we must not increase our dependence."
 
 twizanyika.4.t:0 "Meeting The Guilds"
 twizanyika.4.d:0 "During his first day in Zuvera, representants from the Zuveran architects' and stonemasons' Guilds requested a meeting with the High King, declaring it a matter of high importance. Retikula agreed to their request, but scheduled the meeting with the Guilds for a few weeks in advance, as he had to tend to other duties through Twizanyika - the representant's declaration notwithstanding.\n\nBut now, the meeting had finally happened, and the Guilds; led by the head of the Architects' Tinaye Nhovo, have made an interesting proposal to the High King: The Guilds would be allowed full control over the operations of repair and construction of Twizanbwe, in exchange for the guarantee that they would be finished in record time. This was conflicting to Retikula for mainly two reasons: While the Guilds of Zuvera were well-known for their good construction practices - they had helped build the Great Twizanbwe, after all; it would come at the price of ceding power to them, which would undoubtedly anger the traditionalists giraffes. On the other hoof, refusing their help would sour the relationship with the Guilds, and it is not unlikely that they would turn to factions that would promise them more power.\n\nWhich option will Retikula choose?"
 twizanyika.4.a:0 "Of course."
 twizanyika.4.b:0 "Thanks for the offer, but I refuse."
 
 twizanyika.5.t:0 "A Letter"
 twizanyika.5.d:0 "The Queen of Musangano was, typically, neither a very busy nor a very idle giraffe. But with the Grand Council being invoked by Retikula, it seemed as if every issue just popped up at the forefront. First, of course, were the restoration efforts in Twizanbwe; but Revai's trial and the coal of Zuvera were also particulary concerning issues for her. The latter was a sour one for Rungano as well, as she just received the news that Retikula opted not to exploit the coal deposits in Zuvera. What was the High King's reasoning for rejecting the proposal, she didn't know - but it was as he wanted to hold back Twizanyika either unknowingly, or worse, on purpose. She shook her head as she stared out at the city of Musangano. The confluence of the rivers provided a great way for trade to flow in and out of Twizanyika, yet still the Kingdom was treated as a lesser in the Council.\n\nA servant shook her out of her thoughts. The shorter giraffe informed Rungano that a letter from Matanda had arrived, marked as one of high importance. The Queen thanked the servant before being handed the letter, and she frowned as she saw it bearing the official stamp of King Dzinashi III of Matanda. Opening the letter, she began to read it.\n\n"Queen Rungano V, of Musangano. The development of trade with the griffons to the east, as we both know, is of extreme importance to your Kingdom. However, with the High King's recent actions regarding coal, this trade is under threat for the sole reason of placating so-called traditionalist giraffes. It is with this that I propose that we form a common front in the Grand Council, for Matanda has also suffered from the lack of trade in the last decades. - King Dzinashi III of Matanda."\n\nRungano once again frowned as she finished reading the letter. Dzinashi was right, objetively, but she couldn't shake the feeling that empowering both of their Kingdoms was not the only reason he had sent this letter. Still, the least she could do is respond to the letter... or perhaps not. She formulated her response as she stood..."
 twizanyika.5.a:0 "Respond positively."
 twizanyika.5.b:0 "Ignore it and throw the letter away."
 
 twizanyika.6.t:0 "Military Reform"
 twizanyika.6.d:0 "Following the defeat of the Twizanbwean Royal Guard against the forces of Boltrus in 1002 ALB, a great wound was made to the pride of the giraffes' armies, and have shown to many the inherent outdatedness of Twizanyika's current military structure. To remedy this, two proposals have been put forward to High King Retikula.\n\nThe first one is put forward by Upenyu Bakatwa, the commander of the Twizanbwean Royal Guard, and a close friend of the High King. It proposes learning from the experiences of the defeat against Boltrus, to initiate a program of deep reform of not only Twizanbwe's army, but those of all Twizanyika. While Retikula agrees to this, it would undoubtedly lead to protests from traditionalists and the other monarchs of Twizanyika, who would see it as an interference of the High King inside their Kingdoms.\n\nThe second proposal is led by Fadzai Zvakaipa, this time the commander of Zuvera's Royal Guard - who had impressed High King Retikula with their perfomance in the stadium's events. Fadzai proposed a recruitment program to be instated through Twizanyika, aimed at bolstering the numbers of each country's Royal Guards and similar land units. While not glamorous, increasing our numbers is something that all giraffes can agree on.\n\nIn the end, it falls on the High King to pick an option."
 twizanyika.6.a:0 "Learn from our experiences."
 twizanyika.6.b:0 "Initiate a small recruitment drive."
 
 twizanyika.7.t:0 "New Uses For Old Land"
 twizanyika.7.d:0 "As Boltrus and his army of raiders, pillagers and thieves advanced towards and from Twizanbwe, it also left a great deal of damage in its way; mainly in the form of ransacked towns and villages. Now, years after the fact, the issue of what to do with these lands has been brought up to the Grand Council.\n\nLandowning lesser noble giraffes from around Twizanbwe and the Gungwa have proposed that these lands be cleared and reconverted for agricultural use, with the displaced giraffes being either moved to other towns and villages on Twizanbwe; or being given residence in the capital itself. This is popular, of course, with these same landowning giraffes - but will very likely cause anger from the refugees who will now see their homes being cleared for fields and orchards, and they may very likely hate our rule, with some advisors even saying that they may support anti-Retikula factions.\n\nThe second option proposes instead to form a resettlement program for the homeless giraffes, rebuilding their towns and villages. While simple enough, and gain us favour from the commoners, it will well displease the landowning giraffes that propose the agricultural clearing option. Apart from the support from the common giraffe, this proposal is also favoured by Queen Rungano of Musangano, who is concerned about the possible effects thousands of homeless giraffes may have on Twizanyika."
 twizanyika.7.a:0 "Resettle the displaced giraffes."
 twizanyika.7.b:0 "New agricultural lands sound good."
 
 twizanyika.8.t:0 "The Gold Rush"
 twizanyika.8.d:0 "Weeks ago, the High King dispatched a team of surveyors and veteran miners northwards to the Kuchamhembe mountains, in order to assess the gold situation in the region. Boltrus' thieves did a great deal of damage to the gold mines of Kuchamhembe, who have for centuries provided the Kingdom of Twizanbwe with much wealth and prestige - surely a blessing from Ivhu and Zuva. Great amounts of gold were stolen directly from the mines by Boltrus' raid, and for the last years Twizanyika as a whole has struggled from the effects of this.\n\nBut now, the surveying party has returned, with good news at that: there still exist very significant deposits of gold deeper inside the mountains, and around the foothills of them. They have proposed a campaign to draw common giraffes to the region, providing them with some means to start exploiting the gold. While this surely would help us greatly in rebuilding our wealth and prestige, its almost no drawbacks has generated suspicion in Retikula. Some giraffes have warned that Twizanyika lacks the proper tools to mine deep into the mountains, after all."
 twizanyika.8.a:0 "Initiate it!"
 twizanyika.8.b:0 "It sounds too good to be true."
 
 twizanyika.9.t:0 "An Accident"
 twizanyika.9.d:0 "Grave news have today reached the court of High King Retikula. It appears that a large mining accident has occured in one of the Kuchamhembe mountains gold mines. The exact cause of this is unknown, but speculation has led us to believe that the lack of adequate tools and training has led to a mistake in the excavation of the mines; leading to a cave-in.\n\nRegardless of any causes, the consequences are clear: hundreds of giraffes are trapped underground, though desperate efforts to rescue them are being initiated by other miners and local giraffes. Dissenting factions have already pounced against us and have started to criticize the government for their initiation of the Kuchamhembe gold rush, and even amongst the common giraffe who we thought would benefit from this, dissent is spreading."
 twizanyika.9.a:0 "Oh dear..."
 
 twizanyika.10.t:0 "The Musangano Journey"
 twizanyika.10.d:0 "A particular high priority for High King Retikula to visit was Musangano, the smallest and some say least prestigious of Twizanyika's Kingdoms. However, Musangano is still a Kingdom, with a voice in the Grand Council - and an ever growing one at that, since in the last decades it has slowly become an economic hotspot due to the increasing trade with the Kompels, at Matanda's expense, who has stagnated from the shifting commerce routes in Zebrica. Queen Rungano, the current monarch of Musangano, is an interesting giraffe; the youngest of all four monarchs of Twizanyika, she has mostly maintained the same thought as her predecessors, that of upholding the status-quo in Twizanyika. However, in the last years she has adopted new ideas, coming from other continents - and Musangano has become the centre of reform in Twizanyika as well, with measures such as land reform and some rights for the common giraffe being put in motion.\n\nRetikula started his journey going southwards from Twizanbwe, arriving in the small city of Chikepe, spending a day with the local lords before embarking on Twizanbwe's Royal Vessel. From there, he travelled downwards the Gungwa River, the sight of the High King's ship aweing both common travellers of the river, merchants and transport boats carrying goods around the Gungwa.\n\nWhen he arrived at Musangano's river port, the High King was given a warm welcome by the workers and other small-time vendors that were present when he arrived, along with other spectators and curious giraffes. Retikula had been instrumental in the expansion of Musangano's port, as industrial goods trade with the Kompels picked up in the late 900's, earning him positive opinion from the local populace. Retikula was also welcomed, of course, by Queen Rungano; with the Kingdom's army and its band providing the adequate musical ceremony.\n\nBoth monarchs, along with other guests, then both attended a more traditional festivals - with dancers and bowls filled with acacia fruits and vegetables, though the presence of newer, more exotic produce coming from other parts of Zebrica or even the world caught the High King's eye. Another highlight was Retikula meeting with the merchants of Musangano, many of which he had already talked with in the last weeks, when they attended the opening of the Grand Council in Twizanbwe. There, the High King repeated his gratitue to the merchants for the investment into the capital's reconstruction, and highlighted this and the efforts of other giraffes to improve Twizanyika's situation - with a phrase that has become the talking point of many in Musangano:"
 twizanyika.10.a:0 "We all work for a prosperous future."
 
 twizanyika.11.t:0 "The Agricultural Issue"
 twizanyika.11.d:0 "As the festival party in Musangano made it clear to the High King the moment he arrived in the city, the local landowners were indeed experimenting with new and exotic produce. Apples, in particular, were of great liking to Retikula.\n\nAll of this has led to an interesting proposal from some of these giraffes pioneering this effort. They asked for official support from the High King, with the promise of an even greater harvest next year, enough to satisfy the luxury needs of many giraffes. While Queen Rungano has herself lended her support to these landowners in their experiments, support from Retikula himself would go a long way to help these new farms grow, both figuratively and literally.\n\nWhile this would do wonders to diversify our agricultural production, there is also the concerns of both the landowners that still dedicate themselves to traditional acacia farming, and the farmers themselves. If we give our support to the pioneers, it is clear that we will anger the traditionalist giraffes, and vice-versa."
 twizanyika.11.a:0 "Favour the new crops."
 twizanyika.11.b:0 "Acacia farming will always be our staple."
 
 twizanyika.12.t:0 "The Trial Of Revai"
 twizanyika.12.d:0 "The issue of Revai, a merchant giraffe originally from Musangano, has become a national issue in a very short time. Revai was originally like many of the other traders of the city, making a profit off selling industrial goods bought from the Kompels, gradually expanding his business to a respectable size. However, everything turned sour for him as it was revealed that he had been smuggling these same goods to Matanda for the last years. The Matandan's, naturally, were outraged at this; and an official investigation was started by their authorities on Revai.\n\n After a lengthy and some say politically-motivated investigation ended, as Matanda has suffered from the increasing trade with the Kompels, a sentence was finally handed to Revai: death. This sentence was immediately met with anger from Musangano, and Revai's trial quickly turned into a national problem, as giraffes debate what should be done with him - if something should even be done.\n\nWith the discourse turning toxic, the arbitration of High King Retikula has been officially been requested, as a neutral voice in the problem. While Revai's crimes are undeniable, many feel that capital punishment is too harsh, and the issue of a politically-tainted court is a great weight on the legitimacy of it. Furthermore, Revai is popular with the common giraffe in Musangano, and his execution may anger them."

 twizanyika.14.t:0 "Correspondence"
 twizanyika.14.d:0 ""Queen Rungano the Fifth, of Matanda. It has come to my attention that in the last days, the High King has refused to let any further development of new and innovative crops in your Kingdom; preventing it from any extra economic growth. In Matanda, too, we have been victim of a similar policy, with increasing centralization in Twizanbwe stopping the economic development of our lands and our people. With this shared struggle between our realms, it is fair that I ask you for your support in the Grand Council for a decrease in the Twizanbwe-centric decision making in Twizanyika. Signed, King Dzinashi III, of Matanda."\n\nA letter from the King of Matanda has arrived in Queen Rungano's court today, asking for her support in the Grand Council against the 'centralist' policies of Retikula. Dzinashi's concerns are legitimate, and Rungano's advisors and the Queen herself have grumbled in the last days over the High King's decision to stop crop development. Still, it is Rungano's ultimate responsibility whether to accept Dzinashi's request, or not."
 twizanyika.14.a:0 "Accept his request."

 twizanyika.15.t:0 "Exchanges"
 twizanyika.15.d:0 "It all started with a letter. Then two.\n\nFollowing the mining accident in the Kuchamhembe mountains, Rungano has been quick to denounce the bad judgement of the High King's advisors, who invited giraffes without any experience in deep mining or even adequate tools into the mountains. This caught the interest of King Dzinashi of Matanda, who was quick to establish a channel of letters and communication between the two Kingdoms. Both agreed that the situation of the common giraffe needs to be improved in order for Twizanyika to fully modernise.\n\nNow, Dzinashi has proposed these discussions to be officialized: given Rungano's experience in enacting modernising reforms, Dzinashi will call in the Grand Council for an official decision to enact a land reform programme in Twizanyika. All he needs is the support of Rungano in the Grand Council."

 twizanyika.16.t:0 "The Warning"
 twizanyika.16.d:0 "Today, a messenger arrived to the High King's court, bearing an urgent message from Queen Rungano of Musangano. In it, the Queen explained that King Dzinashi of Matanda has been contacting her in the past weeks, asking for her support in the Grand Council. While this would be generally curious, but not overly worrying, Rungano suspects that Dzinashi's aggressive contacting; as well as his now-cold attitude towards the High King, mean that the giraffe is planning to topple the Twinzanbwean dynasty from power.\n\nRetikula has suspected this as well, but from lack of any formal evidence he did not want to act on it - indeed, while Dzinashi's attitude towards the High King was cold, this was the rule rather than the exception with Matandan monarchs, who still held a certain resentment towards Twinzanbwe due to the First Twizanyikan War.\n\nIn any case, this message from Rungano has given us enough evidence to reinforce ourselves against any plots against the High King, and we expect Dzinashi's power to be lowered greatly in the coming days and weeks."

Then, another message, Rungano has declared the neutrality of her Kingdom and is de-facto an independent country, choosing not to intervene in the conflict.

 twizanyikawar.1.d:0 "With Dzinashi's declaration of open revolt, the High King, and the city of Twizanbwe as a whole, have been put into a frenzy. Scouts and observators have already reported that Dzinashi is leading an army of more than a thousand giraffes directly towards Twizanbwe, obviously aiming at toppling Retikula from power. Advisors, military leaders, and other giraffes go in and out of the High King's court; drafting and advising Retikula on what to do.\n\nUpenyu Bakatwa, Twizanbwe's Royal Guard Commander and Retikula's trusted friend, advises the High King that he should go on the offensive and meet Dzinashi's forces on the Gungwa River. With the natural defense advantage of the river on the Twizanbwean side, Bakatwa expects that the forces loyal to the High King will triumph, despite their numerical inferiority.\n\nAnother proposal made to the High King is for Twizanbwe's forces to stay and prepare a defense of the city. They argue that Upenyu's proposal will just make a repeat of the defeat Twizanbwe suffered against Matanda in the First Twizanyikan War more than a century ago, and that instead a repeat of the great defense of Twizanbwe must be done. Consequently, they argue that the Twizanbwean's desires to defend their pride and homes will beat back Dzinashi's forces.\n\nThough Zuvera, Twizanbwe's faithful ally, has already pledged their forces to the cause of the High King, it is expected that they will take several days to arrive to support Retikula. Therefore, what the High King will choice as his opening move in this Second Twizanyikan War will most like influence the whole outcome of the conflict."

 twizanyikawar.2.d:0 "Deciding to listen to Upenyu Bakatwa, High King Retikula has assembled Twizanbwe's Royal Guard and started to march southwards towards the Gungwa River. Following the scouting reports, Bakatwa and the High King have decided that Dzinashi's army will attempt to cross the River in one of its more shallow parts - a savannah plain with almost no trees, located north-east of Chikepe. Retikula then ordered his army to prepare for the Matandan's arrival, positioning his twelve bronze cannons so that they are aiming directly at the other side of the river.\n\nThe next day went with almost no incident, which puzzled Retikula and Bakatwa, though they still decided to stay at their position near Chikepe. Then, the next morning, Dzinashi's army was spotted by the Twizanbweans.\n\nThe Matandans first attempted to cross the Gungwa before the barrage of cannon fire supressed them from doing so, taking dozens of casualties in the process. Dzinashi's army, with no artillery of their own and who expected the Twizanbwean's to stay in the city, quickly began to disorganize itself. Seeing the developing chaos in their lines, Bakatwa ordered the Twizanbwean army to advance forward, with the musket and cannon fire raining down on the Matandans - who fired back, but to no avail and in a unorganized fashion. Finally, after forty-five minutes, Dzinashi ordered his routed army to retreat back to Matanda.\n\nFaced with this situation, Retikula now needs to choice whether he will pursue the Matandans back to their capital, or stay in his position at the river and prepare for another attack. With the Zuveran forces arriving soon, and confirming to Retikula that they will follow any of his choices, the High King needs to think his next move carefully. Waiting for the Zuverans seems like the natural choice, but Bakatwa has recommended the High King that he should press his advantage over Dzinashi's army."

 twizanyikawar.3.d:0 "The Twinzanbwean Army pursued the Matandans back to their capital, with the High King's scout infantry; less armored and with lighter weapons, leading the charge and keeping the Matandan giraffes on their tails, keeping them from forging an organized defensive position to repeal Retikula's army. After three days of a chase through the thick Bunyoro Forest, the Twizanbweans finally arrived at Matanda. There, they found that militias of Matandan citizens had been organized by Dzinashi to defend their city, armed not with muskets; but with lances, spears, and other primitive weapons.\n\nThe close-combat in the city made the Twizanbwean's muskets less effective, and such they were too forced to use similar tools in the battle, with some support from the army's cannons as well, which was still the advantage the Matandans lacked. Nevertheless, the Twizanbwean's forced themselves through the city's narrow streets, which contrasted heavily with the large and open spaces of Twizanbwe. The relatively more professional Twizanbweans, along with the newly arrived and well-rested Zuveran forces, repelled any counter-attack by the citizen militia of Dzinashi, until they eventually reached the King's Palace. In the process, large portions of the wooden city were burned down by the collateral effects of the battle. Retikula ordered his army to bombard the Palace until Dzinashi surrendered, which he did a few hours later, before being taken prisoner.\n\nWith this great victory, Retikula's triumph over Dzinashi is now a reality and he stands with almost absolute control in Twizanyika. Now, all he needs to do is consolidate his power and begin, truly, to reform the giraffe nation in his vision."

Through the days, the walls of the city had been prepared in order to meet the enemy, and it seemed as it would as work; as the giraffes of the city also began to help the Guard in its defensive preparations. \n\n The next days were spent waiting for the enemy to arrive, until they finally did. The sound of musket fire began to fill the savannahs near the Twizanyikan capital. At first it seemed that it was all going according to plan, as the defenses held and the Twizanbwean cannons gave Retikula's forces advantage over the Matandans. At first. \n\n Into the battle, grave news arrived to the High King: The cannons had been captured by a group of Matandan forest rangers, which outflanked the High King's forces. At these news, Retikula decided to take matters into his own hooves, and advanced to the front in order to direct his own forces. \n\n Despite this setback, Retikula's command of the Twizanbwean Guard bolstered the morale of the giraffes, and the battle seemed close to be won. Until... a cannonball landed on the High King. Originally aimed at one of Twizanbwe's walls, this calculation error proved fatal to Retikula. \n\n All giraffes stopped fighting as they looked at the scene."

 twizanyikawar.6.d:0 "Retikula decided that it would be too risky to pursue the Matandan army, as doing so would take the Twizanbweans through the dense Bunyoro forest - a terrain the Matandan giraffes knew very well. After all, it was their home for hundreds of years. Instead, the High King has opted for a more defensive tactic, staying at the banks of the Gungwa River while waiting for the Zuveran reinforcements. Consequently, the next few days were spent building defensive positions, in case the Matandans tried to attack once again. However, nothing came. \n\n A few days later, the Zuverans arrived, and both armies were bolstered significantly by this. After all, the forces of both Kingdoms presented a clear numerical superiority over the Matandans. With this in mind, Retikula decided to now march through the Bunyoro, and towards Matanda. Dzinashi would have his just reward for his contribution into destabilizing Twizanyika. \n\n However, things started to go wrong the moment the combined Twizanbwean-Zuveran army entered deeper into the Bunyoro. While forest attacks by giraffes loyal to Dzinashi were expected, as the Matandans were natural experts in forest combat, their number and ferocity were staggering. Formations were disrupted, and the march southwards delayed by hours or even days. Then, just north of Matanda, things really went wrong. As the Twizanbweans prepare to cross a small river that ran through the forest, an attack from the main Matandan army caught them off-guard. \n\n The High King's forces fought valiantly, but the surprise factor combined with the adverse enviroment were too disadvantageous for them. Slowly, the Twizanbweans began to get cut down by the Matandans, which were bolstered by a number of citizen militias. Then, the terrible happened: The High King was struck by a spear from a giraffe while the close-combat was as its most intense. Everygiraffe near the scene watched as Retikula fell to the ground..."

With Musangano neutral, the only threats against his victory were the possibility of Zuvera and Twizanbwe joining forces against him. However, his spies in Twizanbwe had informed him that Retikula has instead decided to fortify Twizanbwe, and call in the Zuverans to attack him at the Gungwa River in order to weaken his forces. \n\n This presented two interesting choices to King Dzinashi. The first option would be to simply continue towards Twizanbwe: he and his officers had estimated that it would take longer for the Zuverans to arrive at the Gungwa than his army. This would enable Dzinashi's army to continue undisturbed towards Twizanbwe, meeting only the High King's forces there. A second option however, was to stay at the bank of the Gungwa river. This would make the Matandans use the river's natural advantage against the Zuverans, instead weakening them, and letting Dzinashi's army continue northwards with a weakened enemy. \n\n Which option will he favour?"

In his mind, fighting with the Zuverans in Gungwa was only going to result in failure, after all; Retikula would not have sent them to the river just because he felt like it. King Dzinashi could call Retikula many things, but one thing he could not, was stupid. As such, the Matandan army continued its way northwards to the Twizanyikan capital. \n\n Days later, the Matandans finally arrived. The battle started with a volley of cannon fire from the Twizanbweans, an advantage which Dzinashi's army lacked. Nevertheless, the Matandan King ordered his troops to move forward, and the battle turned fierce as the attackers tried to dislodge the defenders from the walls of Twizanbwe. The cannon fire from the Twizanbweans was especially concerning, but Dzinashi had already planned a way to capture the artillery: ordering a detachment of Matandan rangers to outflank and take control of the batteries. \n\n The plan worked. Surprised and tactically disadvantaged, the Twizanbwean forces which protected the cannons surrendered and were captured along with the artillery. The Matandans then started to use the cannons to their advantage, and started to fire on the walls of Twizanbwe in order to destroy the defenders. Seeing this quickly reversing situation, the High King decided to take control of the frontlines in order to bolster his army's morale, which at first worked.  \n\n However, one of the now Matandan cannons miscalculated and fired significantly off the walls, and instead landed on top of Retikula. The High King fell to the ground. Seeing their monarch fall to the ground, the morale of the Twizanbwean giraffes collapsed, allowing the Matandans to enter the city. \n\n Some of the Twizanbwean giraffes tried to defend their proud city, but it was too late. Dzinashi's army rapidly advanced upon the Twizanbwean palace, and it was clear that he had won."

The scouts gave Dzinashi the information that the Zuverans would come from the north-west across the river, and so his army prepared itself the next days for the battle that would come, positioning itself along defensive positions. The Zuveran Guard was small in number, due to its historical alliance with the larger and more powerful Twizanbwe, and so Dzinashi was confident in his victory - a victory which would give him and his soldiers a great morale boost. \n\n It was then than in the next day, the Zuverans finally arrived at the position of the Matandan giraffes. Or so they thought. What they thought was the Zuverans, was actually a group of local giraffes that were collecting water in the river. However, confusion had already planted itself in the minds of Dzinashi's giraffes, and so it was too late when they realized that they had attacked this group of normal giraffes, even killing a few of them. It wasn't too long for the local giraffes to learn of this, and a mob began to march against the Matandan King's army. \n\n This would be manageable, if not for the fact that at the same time, the Zuveran forces finally arrived. The mob then allied itself with the loyalist forces, and attacked the Matandans, which soon found themselves overwhelmed. In the chaos of the battle, King Dzinashi was captured by the Zuverans, a fate definitely better than getting lynched by a group of villagers.

In order to forge a stronger, better Twizanyika, he wanted to achieve better relations with Retikula, and with the rest of the Twizanyikan kingdoms. But these were simpler times. After Boltrus raided the High Kingdom, he had come to realize the decadence of the Twizanbwean dynasty. They needed to be removed. Still, not like this... \n\n Dzinashi shook his head.

After all, when it looked that the Matandan's desperate defense of their city was going to be succesful in repelling the attackers, the Zuverans brought critical support in the last hours of the battle - with their giraffes specialised in engineering, they helped breach through many buildings of Matanda, including the bombardment of Dzinashi's palace.\n\nConsequently, the High King has decided to reward the Zuveran giraffes for their historical friendship with Twizanbwe. In a ceremony with Queen Kudzaishe of Zuvera, Retikula presented her with a vast array of gifts; as well as granting the Zuveran Kingdom with new lands seized from Matanda.

However, the High King knew that this was an act of a de-facto secession, and after the war with Dzinashi there was one thought on Retikula's mind: either Twizanyika will be whole, or it will not be.\n\nThus, Retikula and Bakatwa engineered a swift solution to deal with the cowardly Musangano giraffes: the Twizanbwean army would march towards the city, in a show of force that would - hopefully - scare Rungano into submitting once again to the authority of the High King. And so it was. Retikula's giraffes embarked on their invasion of Musangano, and, once they crossed the Kingdom's borders, engaged in a brief firefight with Musangano's Royal Guard; which wasn't very numerous, and quickly defeated. Seeing this, Queen Rungano immediately sent a message to the High King, declaring her surrender - and her reincorporation as a vassal of the High King. This act was celebrated widely by Retikula and his court, who now had full control over Twizanyika. With this fact, the High King's planned reforms for the giraffes were set to start very soon."

It was clear, that this was no simple decree. \n\n And it wasn't. \n\n The decree that the High King signed early today practically abolished the Grand Council's power, stripping it of even its most basic actions, leaving it strictly as an advisory body. Furthermore, it gave Retikula power over the political make-up of the other Kingdom's, giving him power to change advisors and other positions at the High King's will. It also gave the High King a number of other powers, but all with a basic goal at its very end: centralize Twizanyikan power on the figure of the monarch, and only the monarch. \n\n Many giraffes have criticized this decree, but there is nothing they can do.

Ever since the political issues that Twizanyika faced had been more or less resolved through a combination of political maneuvering, and the duel between the High King and King Dzinashi, the whole of Twizanyika - and especially its ruling classes - had been waiting for an announcement from Retikula. \n\n And on this morning they would have it. \n\n "Given the situation that the High Kingdom has faced in the last years, I find it necessary for a comprehensive reform of our social system to be made," the High King said. "We have experienced raids, and political turmoil, and it is more than clear that if we do not reform fast - Twizanyika as we know it will not survive the coming years. Reforms will be started as soon as possible," Retikula finished. Then, he looked around the room of the Grand Council, frowning.

Rather, it was a practice evolved from the natural fact that the monarch of Twizanbwe was also the monarch of Twizanyika. But now, as foreign diplomacy and relations become even more important in this age, this had to change: Twizanyika needed an official flag. \n\n Consequently, Retikula decided to take on this matter as a top priority. A decree newly published today officially established the standard of the High King as the flag of Twizanyika, making it obligatory to be flown in every public building and space in the High Kingdom. Vexillologists and other giraffes are already hard at work at writing a code for the flying of the flag, and the High King has established a flag holiday, where every giraffe is encouraged to learn about the meaning of the Twizanyikan flag - its history, past, and future. \n\n Already, the High King has planned for the flag to be widely taught in the High Kingdom's soon-to-be educational system.

The first High Monarch of Twizanyika, Queen Nyika II, realized that the organizing of a sport for the new country would do much work in her efforts to centralize and form a Twizanyikan identity. To this end, the traditional giraffe practice of 'necking' for combat, which has been done since the Zuva and Ivhu created giraffekind, served a good purpose. \n\n With this in mind, the first 'necking' competitions were made. This crude combat practice evolved into something more graceful, involving armour and rules; and became a popular sport both for noble and common giraffes alike. Indeed, these competitions were places where both nobles and commoners could find themselves in, despite the highly stratified giraffe society. Nevertheless, this sport was never officially recognized, as it lacked a centralized organizer - despite Queen Nyika's best efforts to do so. Despite her victories, the traditions of decentralized giraffe Kingdoms were still very strong in her time. \n\n But now, this has changed. With Retikula's new authority over the High Kingdom and its giraffes, combat necking has been officially designated as a sport - with its own organizing council. This has already had its effects, as the High King has yesterday attended one duel in Twizanbwe's Grand Stadium. Such duel was the final one of a month-long competition, and pitted a local noble with Chamirai, a commoner who has become a celebrity through Twizanbwe due to this combat abilities. Though the match started rather balanced, Chamirai won at the end after executing a variety of skillful moves.

 twizanyika.29.d:0 "The new ideas brought forward by the High King's new reformist government have sometimes the potential to be interesting. One example of this was in clear sight some days ago, following Retikula's proposal of the doctrine of Twizanyikanism, an all-encompassing term for the idiosyncrasies of the giraffe nation and its culture. \n\n Yeukai, a giraffe belonging to the upper leadership of Zuvera's largest architects' guild, has published a treatise expanding upon this doctrine of 'Twizanyikanism' and its meaning to the past, present and future of Twizanyika. According to Yeukai, the Twizanbwean dynasty was blessed by Zuva and Ivhu in order to unify all of giraffekind into one nation, and as such had the most natural and divine claim to the Twizanyikan throne. Furthermore, it elaborated on the symbolism of this: Twizanbwe's walls were viewed as the dynasty's committment to protecting the centre of Twizanyikan civilization; which all other giraffe kingdoms revolved around. Consequently, this 'civilizationism' meant that that Twizanyika was not really a nation in the traditional sense of the word, but the expression of a race united in its goals and purposes, and blessed by the Gods. Yeukai also defended the traditional hierarchies of the giraffe race, based around the height of necks, as it meant that high-necked giraffes were closer to the Gods that those of shorter stature. Then, the treatise finishes on the belief that Twizanyika should adopt a 'walled' doctrine towards its foreign affairs, based on keeping its independence first and foremost, forming relations with other countries based on good-will and pragmatism. \n\n The High King has read Yeukai's work, and found it interesting. Retikula expressed his support for Yeukai's theories, and has gifted the writer a not insignificant amount of gold due to his work. Furthermore, the High King officially established the Treatise as a mandatory read for those who wish to become bureaucrats or professionals in Twizanyika."

 twizanyika.30.d:0 "The greatest issue that Twizanyika faced on the foreign front was certainly the one of the trade with the griffon Kompels. Since they arrived on the shores of Zebrica hundreds of years ago, the Kompels and Twizanyika have enjoyed a stable trading relationship between each other, centered on Twizanyika's natural resources and the Kompels' technology. Indeed, the muskets which the Twizanyikan armies used for much of their history are an adaptation of musket designs bought from the the griffons some time ago. However, as they industrialized, Twizanyika has become dependent on the Kompels' industrial products, stifling the modernisation and industrialization of our nation. \n\n To solve this issue, the High King has been presented by two largely diverging solutions. The first one has been proposed by the wealthy giraffes of Musangano, backed by Queen Rungano herself. It proposes a negotiation with the Kompels, which would establish an official trade deal with the griffons. Consequently, both sides would prevent each other from becoming too dependent as a result of certain limitations which could be introduced in the deal. It is certainly the more attractive solution, but would require the griffons to accept it. \n\n The second option is favoured by the Zuveran giraffes, and certain remnants of Dzinashi's loyalists. It proposes that Twizanyika should simply cut the parts of the deal that make it dependent on the Kompels, though it would continue to trade with them. With this distancing, we should start building up our own resources in short time. It is the fastest solution, but it could come at the cost of some fallout, especially economically. \n\n Which option will Retikula pick?"

Most giraffes took this as the time go to their homes, sleep, or take care of a few final chores. But in Twizanbwe's palace, this was different. \n\n It had nothing to do with the newly-installed electrical lights, though in any different situation they could very well be the cause. Indeed, this marvel of modern technology brought a few more hours of activity within the Palace but, in the end; it had nothing to do with it. The cause now was more... mundane. Or sentimental. \n\n High King Retikula stood in one of the Palace's hallways, staring at himself in one of its tall mirrors. He looked so different from the young bright giraffe that had just ascended to the throne, more than thirty years ago. Certainly older. But also more... weathered? Annoyed? It was difficult to grab an unique expression to what was the end result of so many struggles to turn Twizanyika back into its right path. A less important giraffe would wonder if it all was worth it, in the end. In Retikula's mind it was worth it, but nogiraffe could deny that it was at great personal cost. But such is the fate of the creatures who direct the play of history. \n\n The sound of hoofsteps broke Retikula from his inner ruminations, and his turned his neck to see who was it. His gaze met with that of a smaller giraffe, with eyes orange as his. Retikula smiled, and reached his arm to pat the smaller giraffe on the head. "Dakarai," he said. "What are you doing up so late?" Retikula feigned a strict tone in his voice, but nevertheless, the act fell with his smile. \n\n Dakarai gave a sheepish grin, and lowered his head. "N... nothing. I was just trying to find you," he said. \n\n "For what?" Retikula responded. Young giraffes were curious, all young creatures were. Nevertheless, it intrigued the High King. Before Dakarai could respond though, the sound of more hoofsteps alerted both giraffes of the presence of another. \n\n Farisai emerged from one of the rooms, and walked up to the pair of giraffes. She grinned. "And what are you two doing in this part of the Palace?" she said. \n\n Retikula laughed, and moved to embrace his wife in a hug; Dakarai soon joining them. As he did this, only one thing was in the High King's mind:"

 twizanyika.32.t:0 "Dealing With The Remnants"
 twizanyika.32.d:0 "Despite our defeat of the High King's forces in the Second Battle of Twizanbwe, and the death of Retikula himself, there are still many giraffes within Twizanyika that fight for a return to power of the old dynasty; with Retikula's son, Dakarai, as the new High King. \n\nThese remnants were led by Upenyu Bakatwa, Twizanbwe's highest ranking military commander, and a trusted friend of the former High King. Bakatwa gathered a force of around a thousand giraffes north of Twizanbwe, at the foothills of the Kuchamhembe mountains, using the gold resources of its mines to pay his soldiers. To Dzinashi this act of rebellion would of course not stand, along with the misuse of the valuable precious metal; and he soon sent his own army to deal with Bakatwa's rebellion. \n\nDzinashi's army marched north, through the savannahs that formed a key part of Twizanbwean's landscape, soon meeting the first of Bakatwa's forces at the edge of a forest. Seizing the initiative, the Dzinashi loyalist army attacked first, managing to push back the rebel forces. However, the battle soon took a turn for the worse as Bakatwa used the cover of the forest to succesfully flank Dzinashi's giraffes - taking them by surprise. The battle would have been lost if not for last-second reinforcements, which arrived just in time for Bakatwa to withdraw his forces into the mountains. \n\nBakatwa however managed to be a formidable opponent in the mountains and hills of northern Twizanyika, using the local terrain to his advantage, expertly harassing Dzinashi's forces which were unadapted to the region's conditions. Despite this, Bakatwa's location was soon isolated and cut off from the rest of his army, and without a steady flow of food and water for his giraffes, was forced to battle in these less-than-optimal conditions. The results were predictable, and Bakatwa himself was captured and sent to Matanda, where he was executed for treason against the High King. The rest of the Twizanbwean loyalist rebels surrendered shortly after."

 twizanyika.33.t:0 "The March Towards Zuvera"
 twizanyika.33.d:0 "Besides the still few remaining Twizanbwean loyalists, there was another faction within the High Kingdom that acted as the bulwark of traditionalists and Twizanbwean dynasty supporters: the Kingdom of Zuvera, in the northwest of Twizanyika. This was to be expected, of course, as the Zuverans had a century-long political alliance with Twizanbwe, to the point where Retikula's son had been sheltered by the Zuveran Queen, Kudzaishe VII. \n\nWith almost all of the direct threats to Dzinashi's rule dealt with, the Zuverans were the last major Twizanyikan kingdom which needed to be subjugated in order to fully consolidate his power over the High Kingdom. It wouldn't be easy, Dzinashi knew, as the Zuverans had become masters of defensive warfare and tactics. Nevertheless, an army was sent to subdue them and force Kudzaishe to rejoin the High Kingdom. \n\nAs Dzinashi's army headed towards the city, they encountered a Zuveran army awaiting them at the other side of the Gungwa river. The Zuverans had built a defensive position across the river, and it was obvious to Dzinashi that defeating them would be no easy undertaking. But there was no chance to turn back now, and so he decided to gamble on one asset: the twelve cannons captured from the Twizanbweans.\n\n Dzinashi had anticipated the river crossing, and so had brought over dozens of wooden boats from Matanda and other parts of Twizanyika. Together with other giraffes traversing through the shallowest parts of the Gungwa, Dzinashi began the attack on the Zuveran army, led by Fadzai Zvakaipa. The Matandans first faced significant casualties from the defenders, but soon enough they managed to cross the Gungwa river and regroup effectively in order to attack - helped by the captured cannons. Though the Zuverans defended bravely, they were caught in vicious close-combat fighting, which they were not prepared for. Soon enough, Zvakaipa ordered a retreat back to the city of Zuvera, which Dzinashi soon ordered his army to march towards.\n\n However, Queen Kudzaishe could see that any continued resistance woud lead to the further destruction of Zuvera, and so set to negotiate some surrender to the Matandans. In the end, the Zuverans accepted subjugation into Dzinashi's High Kingdom, on the promise that Dekarai and the rest of Retikula's family wouldn't be harmed in the future."

 twizanyika.34.t:0 "The Battle Of Musangano"
 twizanyika.34.d:0 "To Dzinashi, it wasn't the traditionalists or Twizanbwe dynasty loyalists that were the greatest threat to his rule over Twizanyika. No. While the pro-Twizanbwe forces wanted a return of the old, a turn back to the order that governed Twizanyika before he defeated Retikula in battle, it was the Musanganans that were truly a threat - for they also proposed something new, a different order in Twizanyika, based around 'harmony'. \n\nNot only that, but Musangano was the main point of entrance for Kompel products into Twizanyika, a trade which Dzinashi wanted to end as soon as possible. As such, it was necessary that the Musanganans needed to be dealt with fast. The city of Musangano itself sits at the confluence of the Gungwa and Goridhe rivers, and as such Dzinashi planned an attack that would combine an initial assault with wooden boats combined with the quick capturing of the two bridges that cross the Goridhe. \n\nDzinashi's attack started at dawn, with his best troops in boats disguised as Twizanbwean merchants, which once disembarked in Musangano's river port revealed their true nature; taking out the port's garrison quickly. Meanwhile, another one of Dzinashi's armies had set out from Twizanbwe, seeking to capture the bridges leading across the Goridhe river into Musangano. By this time, however, the Musanganans had already been fighting Dzinashi's invasion; and had done defensive preparations around the bridges. \n\nDzinashi's giraffes took heavy casualties trying to take them, and were forced to stop the attacks and regroup, leaving only the force at the port to try and take Musangano. Led by Rutendo Ongai, a prominent military commander inside Matanda, they succesfully managed to reach one of the bridges - driving the Musanganans out of it and allowing most of the other army to cross through. Then, they advanced through the city, both sides taking heavy casualties.\n\n Not wanting any more slaughter, Queen Rungano V surrendered and submitted to the authority of High King Dzinashi, taking out the greatest threat to his continuation in power."

 twizanyika.35.t:0 "Sights Of Equestria"
 twizanyika.35.d:0 "An interesting event has took the attention of the Twizanyikan nobles recently, as Gwinyai ye Musangano, a Musanganan aristocrat and cousin to the current Queen of Musangano, returned from a long voyage to Equestria. Gwinyai, with her own funds, travelled through the desert alongside a camel caravan, before reaching Colthage; soon boarding a modern boat towards Equestria. \n\nFrom there, she disembarked at the port of Manehattan, the main coastal hub of Equestria. The sights described by Gwinyai in her journal are nothing short of fascinating, with trains more modern than those in the Kompel lands providing a daily form of transportation for thousand of ponies, even being built underground. With the help of local guides, Gwinyai toured the metropolis, mainly through the commercial districts of Bridleway and the centre of the city; the giraffe describing the sounds of the ponies along with new technologies such as the car being one of the most vivid experiences in Equestria. She also recounts her arrival at Manehattan's harbour, where each day volumes of goods enter the city far exceeding those in Matanda. \n\nMoving onwards, Gwinyai travelled into the interior of Equestria - for if Manehattan was its economical centre, its political power was mostly located in the capital, Canterlot, which was located more or less in the middle of Equestria. Unfortunately, Gwinyai suffered along the way a minor neck injury and sickness which left her unable to speak, but nevertheless she continued her journey. Soon, the giraffe arrived at the city of Ponyville, seat of one of the three Princesses - the main holders of power in the country. \n\n Sadly, her aforementioned sickness left her unable to communicate much with the locals, but still the giraffe noted many interesting events in her Ponyville stay. She was first treated by a healer, before moving with one of the Elements of Harmony - a group of ponies which hold great social power in Equestrian society. Gwinyai noted the great amount of care the Equestrians hold towards non-sapient creatures, and the generally friendly nature of the Equestrian ponies, guided by the concepts of friendship and harmony that they seem to hold close as a cultural belief. One of the most remarking facts which Gwinyai has noted in her journal was the Equestrian diet: while drinking tea is common enough in both our nations, with tea parties a popular social event in Equestria, it is the abundance of sweet foods which the giraffe found as striking. \n\nNevertheless, Gwinyai has succesfully returned to Twizanyika with her findings. Her work has circulated amongst the Twizanyikan elite, and supporters of Queen Rungano have taken it as a possible model to reform Twizanyika in the future."

 GIF_tagutswa_gurira:0 "Tagutswa Gurira"
 GIF_tagutswa_gurira_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 26th of June, 953 in Gulatenga\n\n§YBiography§!: The silent face of the republic, Tagutswa was born to a family of minor bureaucrats and opportunists. Raised by wealth and what commodities could make their way to Twizanyika, he watched as his siblings and cousins made their way to minor seats all across the republic. Their shadow, and influence, opened the path for him to rise through the ranks of government.\n\nHe climbed the ladder slowly, spending years under his cousins who barked orders from behind their desks, he learned just how to please those who believed themselves above him with his boundless optimism and friendly demeanor. From cousin, to sibling, to father he served under almost every Gurira in the republic during his career.\n\nAfter years of slow and steady efforts, Tagutswa emerged at the top of the visible chain, only to find the untouchable planter-pirate alliance standing taller. Despite his efforts, he’s been unable to dislodge either without fear of the other rising in their place, leading him to simply attempt to maintain a balance between the two factions for the sake of his family and his job.\n\nThough this has become notably more difficult as tensions between the plantation owners and pirate syndicates begin to rise...\n\n§YPortrait By§!: BunnyShrubby"

 ### IDEAS ###
 
 GIF_exclusive_republic:0 "The Exclusive Republic"
 GIF_exclusive_republic_desc:0 "Ever since its inception, the Twizanyikan republic has served only those with ample material property, who were exclusively given the right to vote and run for public office. But at least there was democracy, even if it was limited. That was until the adoption of the 896 constitution, which solidified the control of the oligarchs and ensured that the nation’s institutions answered to them and them alone. Now, the Central Assembly and the courts are nothing more than rubber stamps in this republic of, by, and for the rich."
 GIF_pirate_planter_divide_1:0 "Pirate-Planter Divide: §GBalanced§!"
 GIF_pirate_planter_divide_1_desc:0 "The republic has been led by an alliance of two factions for the past century: the plantation owners and the pirate syndicates. They do not often see eye-to-eye and have frequently been in direct opposition to each other. Only by maintaining a delicate balance has the status quo been maintained, but as tensions mount, one faction may be able to gain the upper paw…"
 GIF_uneven_economy:0 "Uneven Economy"
 GIF_uneven_economy_desc:0 "By all accounts Twizanyika should be a prosperous nation, with a well-off and thriving populace that benefits from the nation’s ample resources. But that couldn’t be farther from the truth. Although the land is fertile and produces a bounty of agricultural goods, only the planters reap the profits. Meanwhile, any wealth that could be garnered from trade is instead seized by the pirate syndicates, who have grown very rich from their high-seas banditry. This concentration of wealth has left the overwhelming majority of the population very poor, a divide which will continue to deepen if nothing is done."
 GIF_patchwork_military:0 "Patchwork Military"
 GIF_patchwork_military_desc:0 "Twizanyika has never had a formal military and even with the advent of the new millennium this has scarcely changed. The bulk of the nation’s land forces are composed of local militias, which answer to their towns first and the country a distant second. These are supplemented by the various mercenary companies, domestic and foreign, employed by the planters to keep order in their lands. Meanwhile, the “navy” consists of a meager flotilla of repurposed fishing vessels alongside any derelict ships generously loaned by the pirate syndicates. If the military is not reformed soon, the nation may prove easy pickings for anyone who comes knocking."
 GIF_kompel_treaties:0 "Kompel Treaties"
 GIF_kompel_treaties_desc:0 "Soon after they first arrived in Chisimbi, the Kompels made contact with Twizanyika. Although things got off to a rough start, relations were quickly smoothed over, and in 749 ALB, a series of agreements were formalized to ensure continued peace and cooperation. This proved greatly beneficial for both sides, allowing the griffons to settle in relative safety while Twizanyika received access to advanced griffon technology. These treaties have managed to persist to the present day, but the griffons have gradually come to benefit more, perhaps at the expense of Twizanyika, which has become more reliant on the griffons for engaging in trade and importing modern goods."

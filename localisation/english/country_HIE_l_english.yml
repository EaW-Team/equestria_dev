HIE_CTH_a4: "Strike At The Heart Of Evil"
HIE_CTH_a4_desc: "How the mighty Colthage has fallen when entrusted to the heathen Zarishat, the Right Hoof of the Demiurge.

But her general, Monzano still remains, carrying on her corrupting work. She must be purged."

HIE_CTH_a7: "The Bloody Trial Of The Cohorts"
HIE_CTH_a7_desc: "The Cohorts wish to begin their journey to the truths of this world, but they have even farther to go than the Aspirants. They must enlighten themselves, achieve wisdom in the face of Za'al-Maar's corruption, and shed the blood of the enemies of equinity."
HIE_CTH_a8: "Wage War Upon The Soul Thieves"
HIE_CTH_a8_desc: "Soul theft, the disgusting chains of the material world, keep us bound to this realm.

HIE_CTH_a9: "Exalt The Equines Of Bronze And Iron"
HIE_CTH_a9_desc: "Those who craft, making the best they can of this material world we are trapped in, are worthy of respect within the Ascendancy.

HIE_CTH_a12_desc: "The old are often too corrupted by the influence of the Avian to truly understand the Teacher's words. But the young, the young have not yet lived a life in a world controlled by the Avian. They can learn, they can grow into the subjects the Ascendancy needs."
HIE_CTH_a13: "Rebuild The Hearths And Homes"
HIE_CTH_a13_desc: "The home is the core unit of our new society. It acts as a sanctum where equines may live and practice their craft away from sinister forces. But the hearths have gone out in the war, we must rebuild for the good of our subjets."
HIE_CTH_a14: "Bring About The End Of Soul Theft"
HIE_CTH_a14_desc: "No more shall the souls of the equines be corrupted by the Avian! These economic systems of the modern age are nothing more than ways the Avians tie us to this realm.

HIE_CTH_a19: "Bring The Fallen To The Light"

HIE_CTH_a25: "The Invincible Aspirants Of Companionship"

HIE_CTH_c2: "Food For Both Body And Soul"
HIE_CTH_c2_desc: "The work to restore the Godhead cannot be done on an empty stomach, and too many stomachs are empty in Colthage after the war against the crypto-avians. Through the work of the state and the Equines of Bronze and Iron, we can labour to keep the population fed."
HIE_CTH_c3: "Nature Must Be Nourished"

HIE_CTH_c8_desc: "Across Colthage there are old production guilds who are willing to work within our new system. They have accepted the words of the Star Father into their souls, and are willing to create everything we need to exterminate the Avians. With the help of a few Equine of Gold advisors, they shall serve us well."
HIE_CTH_c9: "The Castes Of Production"
HIE_CTH_c9_desc: "In order to maintain the economic output we need to destroy the avian menace, all production must be centralized and placed under the control of skilled Equines of Gold. There is no room for the old ways in the new Ascendancy. All aspects of society must be reshaped."

HIE_CTH_c15: "The Conquest Of Bread"
HIE_CTH_c15_desc: "Throughout the history of Equinity, we have had a diet of grain and other plant-based foods. Unlike Avians and certain Crypto-Avians, we have a superior, entirely vegetarian diet that ensures our strength.

HIE_CTH_b3: "The Wisequines Of The Ascendancy"
HIE_CTH_b3_desc: "The Equines of Gold are gifted with more than just the ability to craft art and poetry.

HIE_CTH_b4: "The Secrets Of Alchemy"
HIE_CTH_b4_desc: "Even before our Ascendancy came to be, Zebras were at the forefront of alchemical sciences. Now, with our newfound drive and clarity given to us by the Star Father our resources will be put together by the Star Father's direction to regain the Godhead."

HIE_CTH_b9: "The Students Of The Divine Teacher"
HIE_CTH_b9_desc: "It is important for the mothers and fathers of today to impress upon their youth what is important in our new society.

HIE_CTH_b13: "Transcendental Governance"

HIE_CTH_b14: "The Transcendental Magistrates"
HIE_CTH_b14_desc: "We must ensure that our judicial services function according to the will of the Equines of Gold. There can be no justice in our society if we allow the crimes of heretics to poison our citizens' minds. All criminals must be punished harshly, but fairly."

HIE_CTH_b16_desc: "The remnants of the materialistic culture that the previous regime had been diseased with still plague us.

HIE_CTH_b18: "The Death Of Private Soul Theft"
HIE_CTH_b18_desc: "It is time to rid our lands of the avian scourge of capitalism and the shackles of debt that it brings.

hippone_sekrit.1.t: "The Price Of War"
hippone_sekrit.1.d: "They stood atop a wooden stage, the design of which spoke more to function than form. An Equine of Gold stood before a podium, flanked by a team of Equine of Silver, all resplendent in the garb that denoted their lot in life. A scroll lay before him, upon which lay a proclamation passed down from the Star Father himself.\n\n"It has come to the attention of the Covenant," the Equine of Gold declared in a sonorous voice, "that deviant soul thieves have been working within the city of Zapsa, hoarding their great wealth to use against the good equines living within."\n\nFrightened murmurs broke out amongst the crowd as the masked legions of the Star Father marched a group of two dozen zebras into the center of the square. They were beaten bloody, but were easy to identify as prominent industrialists and their families who had made the city their home.\n\n"These creatures," the Equine of Gold spat, heedless of the clamoring that grew before him, "have attempted to subvert the purity of our kind by engaging in the decadent vice of capitalism. They have tried to pervert the will of the equine to that of the avian, and in so doing, let the promise of the Star Father fall to ruin."\n\nThe battered zebras were marched from the square into waiting trucks, which departed with a single word from the leading Equine of Silver.\n\n"Thus, the wealth of these creatures shall be turned against them and what they represent. Their treachery shall be used against their crypto-avian masters to the west, and we shall prove the purity of the Equine kind once and for all!""

hippone_sekrit.2.d: ""Hear me, and rejoice O spirits of equinity! You have the privilege of being saved by the great Star Father! While you may now experience suffering, soon, your souls will be pure. Accept these gifts from your Lord and Teacher." The mare paced slowly down the street of the ruined village, preaching to the masses of terrified and starving hiding within the alleyways. "By his wisdom, we equines of gold, silver, bronze, and iron are here to lift you up to the level of true equines."\n\nThe mare stopped as she came to what appeared to be the town center. Turning around, she stood up straight, the sun illuminating her suit jacket in the dusk glow, and began to speak again, "I am Jezalla Zaalatit. Equine of Gold, and servant of the Star Father. I have come to offer relief to you all. As the chosen spirits, you all have a chance to refute the will of Za'al-Maar. We offer you the chance to become what you are meant to be. You need only to submit to the teachings of the Master. The equines of silver shall distribute the food, approach them if you are ready to swear your lives to His teachings."\n\nAs she finished, zebras began limping out of the stores and houses that dotted the square. Each one was directed by an Equine of Silver to a group of equines of bronze and iron. They reported their craft, their family size, and their education. Those who may be warriors were taken on the spot to see if they were worthy of studying the arts of the Grandmasters. All others were sent to collect their charity."
hippone_sekrit.2.a: "Maybe the Star Father isn't so bad..."

hippone_sekrit.3.t: "A Safe Haven"
hippone_sekrit.3.d: ""Hear me, and rejoice O spirits of equinity! You have the privilege of being saved by the great Star Father!" The mare walked at the head of a vast procession into the destroyed city of Zapsa. The city's modern architecture had long since been destroyed in the civil war. Hooves beat against stone roads with rhythmic pounding as the rows of zebras entered the city's limits, towards the large gathering.\n\n"You all have been brought here to witness something glorious! The Equines of Silver have guided you here to show you the teachings of the Star Father in action." Gesturing to the zebras gathered behind her, she declared, "These are the Equines of Bronze and Iron, the craftszebras of our Covenenant. They shall be those good souls who will rebuild your city. And within a month's time, you will live in new homes. A city rebuilt in the image of pure equinity. Many of you shall join their ranks someday, and if you can become talented enough at your craft, you shall achieve enlightenment and ascend as a true spirit of equine perfection. But that is many years of practice away. For now, give thanks to the Star Father, for he is the one who has given you the chance to save your soul!"\n\nOn cue, the Equines of Bronze and Iron began a round of thunderous applause to the speech, and the audience slowly followed. The preacher stepped away from the crowd as a masked Equine of Silver approached her, "You did well, Jezalla. I'll take it from here and ensure corruption is purged from the city."\n\nJezalla turned to him and nodded, "You best follow through on that, Aspirant Zakob. You failed the Star Father once when you did not kill that Avian agent. You shall not fail him again." The aspirant gulped and nodded before turning to his soldiers, "Protect the Equines of Bronze and Iron. Kill any corrupted who resist their work.""
hippone_sekrit.3.a: "At least we've got rooves over our head again."

hippone_sekrit.4.t: "A Field Of Temples and Souls"
hippone_sekrit.4.d: ""Hear me, and rejoice O spirits of equinity! You have the privilege of being saved by the great Star Father!" Jezalla Zaalatit walked amongst a camp of tents and beds, preaching to the injured, sick, and dying. "While the avians have harmed your physical form, they can never damage your soul, that spirit that makes you an equine. A fragment of the Godhead from which we all came."\n\nStopping at the bed of one wounded zebra, Jezalla held her hoof as her leg was stitched together, her screams of pain only silenced when the nurse, and Equine of Bronze and Iron, stuffed her mouth with a gag of willow bark and cotton. The nurse then turned to her and spoke with hushed concern, "Lady Zaalatit, this mare will not survive without alchemical treatment. But only a bit of wound-sealer would guarantee her life. Could you or one of your assistants fetch it?"\n\nJezalla scowled at the nurse, "Do not speak so casually to an equine of gold! You shall be forgiven for the care you show to your work, but do not make the same mistake twice. I shall fetch the treatment." Leaving at a canter, Jezalla approached the largest tent in the field and swept aside the entrance flap, revealing a mare in a lab coat with bright purple-dyed hair and stripes. Upon seeing her, Jezalla briefly kneeled before standing and addressing her, "I apologize, miss. I did not know you would be here. I hope I did not interrupt your work." The zebra turned around to her and hoofed her a bottle, "Not at all, Jezalla. I think you'll be needing this for that patient. Now run along. I have more work to do."\n\nJezalla took the bottle and began to trot back to the patient's bed, not bothering to question how the mare knew why she was there before she arrived. As she left, a hooded figure approached the tent. Entering the tent, the stallion walked up just behind the mare. Looking over, she smiled briefly and turned to face the stallion, "Ah, Grandmaster of Pleasure, have you come for some potions?" The stallion pulled back his shawl, revealing sunglasses and a gauze mask, "Unfortunately not. While I love using your concoctions for my experiments, I am here to give you a summons to Colthage. The Star Father wishes to meet with the Guide once again."\n\nThe mare straightened her back and paused for a second before responding, "Then tell him I'll be there as soon as I can. I will always answer my Teacher's call."\n\nThe Grandmaster nodded and went to leave, before turning back. "Oh, do bring your alchemical supplies. He has uses for them.""
hippone_sekrit.4.a: "The Guide and the Teacher together."

hippone_sekrit.5.t: "The Auspicious Government"
hippone_sekrit.5.d: "The host of the Equines of Gold stood before him at rapt attention. Before him lay a message from the Star Father himself, a sanctified missive that had been penned by his holy hoof. He was but a mere Equine of Gold himself, not quite a master, and thus it was a great honor to have been selected to proclaim these great words.\n\n"Fellow equines, rejoice!" he bellowed, his voice echoing about the amphitheater. "You have all been selected to serve the great Covenant with the dignity befitting your status. He calls you here to act in servitude to your kind, to do what you were born to do."\n\nAs he glanced about the crowd, his eyes settled on a cloaked figure surrounded by Masters of Silver. A striking purple mane was all that could be seen beneath the cloak. She was here. He knew not if the omen was auspicious.\n\n"Rejoice, I say to you!" he continued, unabated, "for you shall be sent to adulate the Star Father's great name! You will be sent to the towns, and the cities, and the hinterlands, and you shall rule in his name against the avian kind. You shall be the bastion that stands before the subtle corruption of the avian, and you will not falter. For this, the Star Father places his faith in you."\n\nWordlessly, the host of the Equines of Gold came before the speaker to receive their assignments. He looked to the crowd, but he could no longer spot the shock of purple among them."
hippone_sekrit.5.a: "In time the system shall cement..."

hippone_sekrit.6.t: "The Death Of The Old Order"
hippone_sekrit.6.d: "The central square in Colthage, though badly damaged, was overflowing with newly ordained equines of every caste. Among them were the six Grandmasters, each clad in ceremonial robes. The presence of just one would normally demand the reverence of all around them, and today all of them had gathered together for a special occasion.\n\nIn front of the gallows sat several bound and hooded prisoners. Above them stood an Equine of Gold, whose commanding voice initiated the ceremony. "Hear me and rejoice, O children of the Godhead! The servants of Za'al-Maar lay defeated before you! As we end this chapter of the Age of Strife, we grant the crypto-avians responsible for the hardships that had befallen you all the fate they so richly deserve."\n\nThe Equine of Gold nodded to the executioners below. One by one, each prisoner was brought up to the gallows and had their hoods removed. They were revealed to be none other than Monzano and most of her government cabinet.\n\nMonzano blinked, her eyes adjusting to the sudden light. She supposed that she should have been surprised to see an unending sea of fanatics cheering for her execution, but she'd long since passed the point of caring. Zarishat had abandoned Colthage, and Monzano paid the price for it. Even Jezabzella and Zalathel had managed to escape, further rubbing salt in the metaphorical wound.\n\nHer thoughts were interrupted by the floor beneath her giving way to open air. There was a snap, and then she did not think at all."

hippone_sekrit.7.t: "A Lion Declawed" #podrick
hippone_sekrit.7.d: "Out in the wilderness south of Hippone, naught but the sound of shovels hitting the dirt could be heard. There was a fort nearby, a former holdout for Zannido 'Bandolier' Zidon. Several Equines of Silver were digging holes under the supervision of an Equine of Gold, while the entire fort's holdouts were either dead or restrained. Surprisingly, Zannido had survived the brief firefight, though he too found himself among the prisoners.\n\nAs the Equines of Silver finished digging, they lined up Zannido and his cohorts next to the holes. Accepting that he was about to die, Zannido opened his mouth to request some last words. However, a bullet entered his throat before he could speak. Several other gunshots rang out, and thus the Lion of the West and his followers came to an end in their unmarked graves."
hippone_sekrit.7.a: "One less vermin to deal with."

hippone_sekrit.8.t: "The Shining Light..." #podrick
hippone_sekrit.8.d: "When it became clear that the last defenders of Trotkat could not hold the city, they started weighing their options. The last ships had already fled, so they decided to raise the white flag and send out some diplomats to negotiate. It soon became clear that there would be no peace talks, as each diplomat they forced out to try and talk to their attackers was met with a bullet.\n\nEventually, they had become completely surrounded. With Equines of Silver battering at their gates, they threw Benoam Gerza out as a last-ditch offering in hopes that it would appease the purple-clad warriors. But as their walls were broken down and they faced the ends of hundreds of barrels, they finally realized that they were would be no negotiations, only death to all who opposed these fanatics."
hippone_sekrit.8.a: "...Was a muzzle flash."

hippone_sekrit.9.t: "The Price Of Art" #podrick
hippone_sekrit.9.d: ""Hear me, and rejoice O spirits of equinity! You have the privilege of being saved by the great Star Father!"\n\nGathered together in the ruined streets of Colthage were thousands of prisoners of all ages. Though they had not resisted the advances of the Equines of Silver, they had committed a lesser sin: Apathy. These zebras were not sufficiently moved by the words of the Star Father, instead choosing to continue their daily lives as if nothing had changed.\n\nSuch a choice was justly rewarded, as the Equines of Silver had paraded them from their homes with no regard for the sick or elderly. Now they were forced to stand still as an Equine of Gold repeated the mantra that they had heard several times in recent history.\n\n"While you are not servants of Za'al-Maar, your souls have been corrupted by its influence. Fortunately, this corruption is only slight. Today, you will be granted the opportunity to cleanse yourself so that you may wield your fragment of the Godhead with pride. Only through virtuous labour can you accomplish this. And so, here you will be placed under the careful watch of those most worthy to teach you in this task." The Equine of Gold stood back, allowing several Equines of Silver to come forward, who themselves were followed by even more Equines of Bronze and Iron.\n\nThe prisoners were divided equally amongst the Equines of Bronze and Iron, again with no regard for families or their ability to perform hard labour. A few had resisted, but their rebellious acts were quickly cut short by the Equines of Silver standing guard. Those who could not perform the work were also shot.\n\nOver time, the architecture of Colthage was restored, though in a baroque style as was demanded by the Equines of Bronze and Iron. Very few traces of the original city's look remained in the end, for it had been reborn in an image worthy to house the Star Father's children."
hippone_sekrit.9.a: "The building blocks of a new dawn."

hippone_sekrit.10.t: "The Ascendancy" #podrick
hippone_sekrit.10.d: "Throughout the former territories of the Colthaginian Republic, there was silence. The cities which once played host to many a battle are now still, while the roads between them no longer suffer the banditry of the unfaithful. There was not a single avian or crypto-avian left.\n\nNow only equines remain, and many of them have already adopted the righteous path laid forward by the Star Father. There are of course a few who have had... difficulty accepting the wisdom of the Equines of Gold. Though in time, every stallion, mare, and foal within our land shall know of the purity of the Godhead.\n\nBy the will of our Divine Teacher, the borders have been closed and all trade has been turned away. Missives have been sent throughout the land to inform the Equines of Gold of the next steps to be taken in our holy journey.\n\nWith rapturous joy, the Equines of Gold proclaimed the formal name of our nation: The Ascendancy of Zebrakind. Celebrations were held in every city as our place in the world was finally cemented. The outside world was less celebratory, as many nations and creatures of every kind have expressed "untold horror" at our existence. It matters little, though. They do not understand the Spirit of Equinity that flows through us. We shall teach them of this gospel through fire, if necessary. All will accept the Godhead as the undeniable truth.\n\nFor we are The Ascendancy, and none shall stand against us."

hippone_sekrit.11.d: ""Hear me, and rejoice O spirits of equinity! You have the privilege of being saved by the great Star Father! Even now, your cities are being rebuilt and your homes are being restored!" The Equine of Gold slowly made her way through the street, observing the large detachment of Equines of Silver assisting in repairing the damage done to this small town from a prior battle.\n\nSpotting a large pile of rubble blocking the road ahead, she motioned to some nearby Equines of Silver to clear it. "Though you have undergone many hardships in recent years, know that salvation can be yours if you accept the aid of those who serve the Star Father! This aid comes from one spirit of equinity to another..."\n\nFrom one town to another, the Equines of Silver helped the distraught and homeless get back on their hooves. The multiple wars had not treated the non-combatants kindly, to say the least. Almost every place had been affected in some way, and so the Star Father had made a point to show the locals that he and his followers had the best interests of Equinity in mind.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, this decision seemed to pay off as more and more zebras desired to help the Equines of Silver with each town that they fixed up."
hippone_sekrit.11.a: "Bit by bit..."

hippone_sekrit.12.t: "Our Grand Victory" #podrick
hippone_sekrit.12.d: "We stand atop the broken bodies of the crypto-avians. Victorious, but not unscarred. Za'al-Maar's constructs in Colthage have been destroyed, and those responsible for poisoning the equine spirit shall soon perish as well.\n\nAs for those who have not partaken in our righteous cause, they shall not be allowed a reprieve. Their strength and resolve will now be tested to determine if they are worthy of the equine spirit they possess. In time, all who live inside of our borders shall be stalwart servants of the Star Father.\n\nThe steps ahead will be difficult, but necessary. The nation lays in ruins, though soon it shall be rebuilt in an image worthy of the Godhead. One thing remains certain, however: There are scarce few who understand our divine mission, and when the time comes to fulfill it, there may be many who seek to stop us.\n\nBut they can be dealt with later. For now, we shall collect ourselves."

hippone_sekrit.13.d: ""But ma, we don't want to go away!"\n\n"It is what is required of you. You're going to become Equines of Gold! That's not an honor given to many children, much less those within the same family."\n\n"But we'll never see you again!"\n\nThe children grasped at their mother's robes, desperately begging to not be sent away. She gently pushed them away, then knelt down to be at their eye level as she looked into her children's eyes. "The Star Father has asked us to do some difficult things. I know that going away to a special school is scary, but it is for the best. This is a school made for very special foals, much like yourselves. You are going to become the greatest zebras in the Ascendancy one day, you know."\n\nDespite her attempts at reassuring the children, they still seemed hesitant. Their mother brought them in close for a hug. "And it won't be forever, we will see each other again one day. I know it's going to be hard, but just because we'll be apart doesn't mean that I won't love you any less. Now go, it's time to begin your training to become Equines of Gold, just like me."\n\nAs the children hesitantly left to join the caravan that would take them away, their mother steeled herself against her hidden tears. This was necessary. The Star Father wouldn't have things done this way unless it was for a good reason, she told herself."

hippone_sekrit.14.d: "The smoke cloud billowed high with the words of blasphemy. All throughout Colthage, books from Griffonia, Hippogriffia, and those with similar sacrilegious origins were being confiscated and thrown into an ever-increasing fire pit. Regretfully, a few Equines of Gold had to be included in this fire as well, as some of them had made claims that heretical knowledge might be worth keeping around to help future generations understand the corrupt mind of the Avian.\n\nThe risk was not worth it. All traces of the Avian must be removed from this world. The ideas and concepts that they have created or corrupted are not exempt from this rule. Socialist and Communist literature is among the most heinous of these ideas; even the very act of describing them is enough to plant the seeds of degeneracy in one's mind.\n\nAnd there are none who know this better than Jezalla Zaalatit, who has been overseeing this book burning for several hours now. Just the other day she had the misfortune of coming across a passage written by a crypto-avian named Caramel Marks, and the ideas being presented on it were enough to drive her to request that the Star Father order an immediate purge of this and other heretical books. However, the Star Father agreed to do this only if non-offensive books remained untouched, as many great works have been written by equines not of our faith.\n\nIn time, Colthage shall know only the purity of the equine spirit."

hippone_sekrit.15.t: "The Urban Renaissance" #24
hippone_sekrit.15.d: "It had been a long process, but by the divine decree of the Ascendancy, the city of Zur had undergone a dramatic transformation from war-torn ruin to symbol of the prosperity and plenty the Ascendancy had to offer its equines. When the Ascendancy first seized control of Zur, it had been a shell of itself, with starving and poor zebras living in the shattered husks of their simple dwellings, trying to survive the indescribable chaos of the destructive civil wars that had plagued the dying corpse of Colthage. But now it was something far greater. Through the Star Father's wisdom and generosity, the city of Zur had been rebuilt from the ground up in a beautiful blend of traditional Colthaginian adobe and stately, almost divine, Baroque pillars and edifices of stone and marble. It was a city that represented the righteous might and the promising future that the Ascendancy would make a reality for the equines of the world as they struggled to restore the Godhead.\n\nThough Zur was surely home to many crypto-avians and nonbelievers who hid beneath the Star Father's watchful gaze, the renovations seem to have done wonders to quash the malicious lies of their arguments against our cause. The equines of Zur now walk the streets of their new city with heads held high, and the new markets and parks are abuzz with excitement from the city's residents. Perhaps there is no greater indicator of how wonderful the new Zur is than the overflowing fiesta organized by the Ascendancy to celebrate the completion of the rebuilding. Every equine who could make it has filled the streets in celebration, with no regards to their social standing or their castes for one wonderful night. Dutifully observed by numerous Equines of Silver, the equines of Zur celebrated the Ascendancy's bounty late into the night."
hippone_sekrit.15.a: "Zur is but one of many fulfilled promises of our glorious future!"

hippone_sekrit.16.t: "The Masters Of Finance" #24
hippone_sekrit.16.d: "The Equine of Gold sat on her balcony with a book propped up in front of her, reading in the shade on a sunny day. She had spent the entire morning hard at work writing orders to execute the Star Father's latest decree, and now that her work was done, she could enjoy herself as the Equines of Silver carried them out.\n\nIt wasn't long before she heard the first shouts gathering in the streets below, and as they grew louder, the Equine of Gold marked her page and looked over the balcony towards the gathering commotion. A crowd had formed on both sides of the street, jeering and shouting at the numerous zebras bound in chains and led toward the gallows deeper in the city by a cohort of Equines of Silver. She recognized their attire and the way they carried themselves, and knew that her orders had been faithfully accomplished. When the Ascendancy had first risen to seize Hippone and begin the great purification of equinedom, many of those zebras, all bankers and patricians, had supported the Star Father's visions and had lent financial support. But the Equine of Gold knew that those were merely the lies of crypto-avians. These nonbelievers had never truly supported the Ascendancy, instead hoping to profit from its rise and claim their place in the new order. But they were all tainted by the avian poison of banking, and left unchecked, they would sabotage the rebirth of the Godhead. For that, they had to be purged.\n\nThe Equine of Gold returned to her book with a small but pleased smile on her muzzle. One step at a time, the Ascendancy would be free of enemies both without and within."
hippone_sekrit.16.a: "We will not stand the taint of avianism in our ranks."

hippone_sekrit.17.t: "In The Court Of An Equine Of Gold" #24
hippone_sekrit.17.d: ""O judge, the convicted standing before you is guilty of theft. How shall he die?"\n\nThe Equine of Gold looked down from his bench at the zebra standing before him. Shackles bound the convict's legs together, and a bridle had been fitted so tight to the zebra's muzzle that he could not open his mouth to speak for himself. There was fear in his eyes, raw and palpable. Everyzebra knew that since the Equine of Gold had taken up residence in Neigheris as its supreme judge, the Ascendancy's brutal law had begun to strangle crime in the region -- often by strangling the criminals who committed them.\n\nThe judge looked down at his notes, then back to the convict before him. He was a small zebra, and the judge realized he was looking at a colt, and a scrawny and starving one at that. "How old is the convict?" he asked.\n\n"Fourteen, your Supreme Honor," the bailiff answered. "But he is a criminal, and the punishment for theft is death."\n\n"I asked only for his age," the judge answered, and the bailiff shrank back at the reprimand of an Equine of Gold. "But you are correct. The punishment for theft is death. However, this poor colt is starving. He stole bread only to feed himself. That is a failing on the part of the regional authorities for failing to provide for all the equines they are responsible for. The crime is not his alone to bear." Then he looked at the convict, whose fear had mixed with surprise and confusion. "With which hoof did you steal the bread from the baker?" he asked him, and when after a moment the convict slightly raised his right foreleg as far as his chains would let him, the Equine of Gold nodded and stood up to pass judgment. "In recognition of the unfortunate circumstances that brought you before me, I, in the name of the Ascendancy, grant you mercy on your life. But theft is a serious crime. You would taint the Godhead should you not be purged of your sins." He turned to the bailiff. "Remove his right foreleg, and then release him. He will be cleaned of his guilt. Then bring me the mayor. As he shares in the crime, so too shall he share in the punishment.""

hippone_sekrit.18.t: "The Waterfalls Of Tefemanei" #24
hippone_sekrit.18.d: "The waterfalls of Tefemanei are well-known throughout our country as a beautiful spectacle, but a beautiful spectacle will contribute little to restoring the Godhead. Instead of a pleasant sight, we should instead see them as a resource to be utilized for the Ascendancy's benefit. As such, we have opened proposals to decide on how best to harness the power of water.\n\nWe now have two options before us. Those who sit firmly in the Zynskaite camp want to divert the rivers that feed the falls to create natural reservoirs that can be drawn upon for our agriculture and even serve as small recreational areas for well-deserving equines. Those drawn to the Zidonite camp, however, recognize the sheer power of the water moving over these falls and advocate creating a vast system of hydroelectric dams and fresh water fish farms to generate power and food for our people. We will have to settle the dispute over the falls for them, but one thing is for certain, the waterfalls of Tefemanei will be changed forever to better suit our needs."
hippone_sekrit.18.a: "The Zynskaite plan of food and fun sounds best to me."
hippone_sekrit.18.b: "The Zidonite plan of unlimited hydroelectric power is the way to go."

hippone_sekrit.19.t: "The Verdant Jungles Of Karamane" #24
hippone_sekrit.19.d: "The jungles of Karamane are some of the most dense and lush in Zebrica, and since the dawn of Colthage itself they have been almost impenetrable to civilization. But the will of the Ascendancy is not to be ignored, and now we have the opportunity to repurpose these jungles to better suit our needs. The only question is how?\n\nThis is certainly a contentious question, and Qarnaim Sikarbaalid and Zisa Zaalatit have gone back and forth as their factions argue over how best to utilize the Karamane jungles. Sikarbaalid and the Zynskaites want to section off large chunks of the jungle as wildlife preserves and essentially allow them to exist as they are, untamed by civilization. Zaalatit and the Zidonites see the chance to section off portions of the jungles and use them to cultivate various tropical plants that are difficult to grow elsewhere. We certainly not allow the Karamane jungle to proceed as it is while also trying to bend its flora to our will, so we will have to choose between the two proposals."
hippone_sekrit.19.a: "Sikarbaalid's plan of creating a nature preserve in the jungle sounds best."
hippone_sekrit.19.b: "Zaalatit is right, the jungle should serve us, not the other way around."

hippone_sekrit.20.t: "The Pearl Fields Of Qatrain" #24
hippone_sekrit.20.d: "Off the coast of Qatrain lies an abundance of clams, oysters, and countless other bivalves, as the waters are shallow, warm, and rich in the nutrients necessary to support a diverse ecosystem. Since time immemorial, the zebras who live along the coast have harvested these bivalves both for their meat and the precious pearls they produce, forming a strong and robust local economy. But splitting this economy in two ways is wasteful when instead we could be focusing on one or the other and maximizing it for the benefit of the Ascendancy.\n\nThe issue is fairly even split and rather straightforward, but in the perpetual jousting between the Zynskaites and the Zidonites, they have each sided with one half of the local economy over the other. Sikarbaalid's Zynskaites want to cease the collection of oyster pearls and instead focus on harvesting bivalve meat to supplement our food resources, seeing pearls as nothing but a frivolous luxury that the Ascendancy can do without. Zaalatit's Zidonites argue instead for the opposite, in expanding the oyster fields and implementing sustainable harvesting techniques to collect pearls without harming the oysters, allowing the industry to boom and grow very profitable indeed. It is up to us, therefore, to decide whether we value the oysters more for their meat or their pearls in deciding what to do."
hippone_sekrit.20.a: "Oysters and bivalves are food, little more. The Zynskaites are right."
hippone_sekrit.20.b: "Pearls are a luxury that will help boost our economy and make our citizens grateful. The Zidonites are right."

hippone_sekrit.21.t: "The Carmine Reefs Of Zjerba" #24
hippone_sekrit.21.d: "One of the things the small island of Zjerba is renowned for is its astonishing array of splendid coral reefs. The coral comes in all shapes, sizes, and colors, and is home to countless species of aquatic wildlife. Before civil war and destruction plagued the dead Colthaginian Republic, those who could afford it would travel to Zjerba and make it a point to stop and visit the reefs. A small tourist industry arose around the island, and though the civil wars shut it down for quite some time, it is just now beginning to pick back up.\n\nThere is an opportunity to invest in the economy of Zjerba and turn this small island into a tool to contribute to the Ascendancy for the peace and plenty we bring to its equines, centered around its reefs. The Zynskaites were the first to submit a proposal to us over the fate of the island, and as we understand it, many of their members had taken vacations to Zjerba in the past. The Zynskaites want to see the reefs receive official protection from the Ascendancy and turn Zjerba into one massive natural resort that we can use for both its propaganda value and as an enticing reward for the well-performing equines of the Ascendancy. Not to be outdone, the Zidonites immediately submitted a counterproposal to develop industry on Zjerba and turn it into something other than a beautiful, if effectively useless, vacation destination. They argue that the reefs are already protected enough as is, but the waters and the resources on the island could be better used by bringing them to the people rather than bringing the people to them. Both sides have some merit in their proposals, and neither is willing to budge."
hippone_sekrit.21.a: "A vacation sounds pretty nice about now... let's see the Zynskaites' plan in action."
hippone_sekrit.21.b: "Now is not the time to rest and stare at fish! Let the Zidonites make something of this island."

hippone_sekrit.22.t: "The Crystal Caves Of Colthoba" #24
hippone_sekrit.22.d: "Deep in the mountains and hills of Colthoba lie a twisting and complex series of caverns and caves that are a great source of crystals, though as of yet largely untapped. Crystals are some of the most important reservoirs of magic in this world, and acquiring more of them will be an important step in restoring the Godhead. Thus it is of great interest to us to see these caves properly exploited and their resources harvested to better execute the Star Father's will.\n\nAs Colthoba is a part of Trotkat, this project in particular has attracted the interests of the Trotkatian hippologist Qarnaim Sikarbaalid and he has personally presented a proposal to the Ascendancy's leadership. Sikarbaalid believes that the best way to utilize the crystals in his home state is to perform great alchemical experiments in the caves to actively cultivate more crystals and increase the amount of magical power they can store. Hearing that the Zynskaites were actively pursuing a plan of economic development in the base of their power, the Zidonites were quick to bring forth their own plan, with Zisa Zaalatit escalating it to the attention of the Star Father himself. Rather than strengthen the crystals in Colthoba, the Zidonites seek to harvest them and haul them out of the caves to power factories in our major urban centers. Though this exploitation would rob Colthoba of what makes it unique and undermine the Zynskaites' influence, the Zidonites assure us that political squabbles have no basis in their motivations to improve the Ascendancy as a whole. Whichever faction we side with will in all likelihood receive a fairly notable leg up over their rivals, so we should choose carefully."
hippone_sekrit.22.a: "Who would better know how best to use the resources of Colthoba than Sikarbaalid?"

hippone_sekrit.31.d: "The streets of Colthage were packed with equines, each struggling to get closer to the grand plaza in the city center where the Star Father was due to issue a proclamation. That in itself was not cause for the massive turnout, though the Ascendancy expected all its equines to stop whatever they were doing to hear it. It was the fact that the Star Father himself would be issuing the proclamation in person, and not through an Equine of Gold. Whatever it was, it was going to be important.\n\nWhen there was no more room left to stand, and scarcely any room left to breathe, a frenzied roar went out over the crowd as numerous figures emerged onto the grand stage erected for them. First were two score Equines of Silver who formed a perimeter around the stage, then a dozen Equines of Gold who occupied the center. Following them were not one, not two, but all six of the Grandmasters: Pleasure, Pain, Love, Poetry, Joy, and Virtue. And then, finally, in the center of it all, was the zebra himself: the Star Father, Hiram Zerranid.\n\nFor any other creature, it would have taken minutes for the screaming adulation to die down, but Hiram only had to raise a hoof, and the streets of Colthage fell into silent reverence. The Star Father looked out over his gathered supporters, the innumerous faithful, and finally, the equines of Colthage heard his voice. "Hear me and rejoice, O spirits of equinity!" he began, much as his preachers had done for his words in the past. "The time has finally come for us to reclaim our right beyond the veil of the mortal world. We have built our society to be pure and deserving of the restoration of the Godhead, and now it is time to turn our focus against our enemies: the vile corrupting threat of avians everywhere!"\n\nHisses of anger at the hated avians rose from the gathered thousands, and Hiram let them linger for a moment before he continued. "The Ascendancy is strong, and we are pure of heart. But until the curse of aviankind is removed from this world forever, we will never return to the embrace of the Godhead. That is why it is now our duty, our sacred obligation, to bring death to the avians that pollute this world! Every avian we can find, we will kill, and we will use their punished, wicked souls to bring ourselves closer to our destined future! The scourge of Za'al-Maar will be purged from this world!

Now he was being tied to a wooden post alongside his fellow comrades, the revolutionaries that had sacrificed so much in the name of freedom and liberty.\n\nHe thought back to the moment he had received the news of Zesh's death. How angry he had been, how vengeful he was... and how he had gone to tell Zarishat of the news. Why... why did he think that she of all zebras would step up to the plate in Coltva's time of need? Perhaps he had convinced himself that her brother's death would lead to a radical change in her lifestyle, one where she would finally take steps to improve herself and...\n\nOzid looked down to see a fire flickering at the base of the wooden post. He suddenly became aware of the mass of zebras around him, cheering for his demise and spitting in the face of everything he had believed in. He wanted to shout at them, to say that the revolution would never die, but he knew inside that he would be lying to them. He had already lied to himself, for the revolution had truly died with Zesh.\n\nThe fire spread, igniting Ozid and his comrades. He did not scream, but his tears evaporated as the fire consumed him."

However, something has changed recently that has the entire Legionary Council in a heated debate.\n\nJust yesterday a letter was delivered to our border by a group of elegantly robed zebras, one of which seemed to fit the description of an "Equine of Gold" according to our agents in the Nightmare's Hoof. Though its contents were worded as fancily as their preaching tends to be, the message was easily discernable:\n\nThe Ascendancy wishes to extend the offer of an alliance to us for the purpose of attacking Hippogriffia. Should we accept this offer and succeed in our shared conquest, we will receive all of the Zumidian territories, the islands in the Canteribbean, and the city of Winggarden, while the Ascendancy only desires to possess the rest of the primary Hippogriffian island. Afterwards, we would be free to stay out of each other's respective ways.\n\nThe offer is fairly enticing, to say the least.

Furthermore, their uniforms stood out like a sore hoof against the asymmetric robes of the Equines of Gold who greeted them.\n\nFortunately for all parties involved, the negotiations were quick and easy. The Chiropterrans have agreed to the majority of our terms, with the only significant alteration being the matter of the city of Winggarden: they wished to "experiment" with it, should our shared conquest be successful.\n\nWith the agreement settled, plans were drawn up to establish official diplomatic channels between Chiropterra and the Ascendancy.

All throughout the once-magnificent city were panicking hippogriffs trying to escape and zealous executioners ensuring that they didn't. Every building was meticulously searched for hideaways, then torched to ensure the lasting destruction of Hippogriffian society. Schools and hospitals were the primary targets of sarin and other nerve agents, while residential areas were carpet bombed into oblivion.\n\nThe former queen and her daughter were rumoured to have escaped into the ocean, but the vast majority of the surface-dwelling hippogriffs were not so lucky. Those that took to the sky were ruthlessly gunned down by the Equines of Silver, while countless others met their end in equally horrific manners. Poisoned bullets, expanding ordnance, and napalm flamethrowers were just a few of the weapons utilized against the civilian populace.\n\nAll of these things and more were happening to everygriff around the young Brine Weed. Her mother had snuck Brine's grandfather and her out of the house while she distracted the zebras breaking down their front door. Through their neighbor's yard she and her grandfather fled, before they accidentally ran into a small group of purple-clad fanatics.\n\nNow she sat alone, hiding inside of a playground slide with no idea of what to do.

His Grandmasters, Equines of Gold such as Jezalla and the Guide, and a few other respected subordinates stood a short distance away from him. Some looked apprehensive, while others displayed frisson. Everything that they had worked towards led up to this moment, here and now.\n\nBefore Hiram were eight pedestals adorned with banners displaying the exotic potions that he had crafted with the aid of his trusted Guide. He approached the pedestals, then turned to face his audience with a kind smile. "I would like to say that what we've accomplished thus far is truly extraordinary. In the beginning we were aiding the poor and sick. Then we were cleansing this world of evil. Now we stand at the precipice of our grandest moment yet. It's hard to put into words exactly how thankful I am to you all, truly. I want you to know that none of this could have happened without you all. Your sharpened skills, your brilliant minds, your unwavering faith. And now..."\n\nHiram paused, grabbing a potion with his hooves, "...Let us begin." He guzzled down the first potion, then quickly moved onto the others before the effects kicked in. As he finished drinking the last one, he heard the crystals power up. He took a deep breath, then closed his eyes as the crystals activated.\n\nFirst, there was darkness. And then, like a storybook unfolding, the world came into creation. Mountains and valleys, plains and deserts, everything formed over an eternity and in an instant. Creatures appeared from nothing, from each other, from deities. There were wandering families, tribes, primitive societies. There were monsters spawned from goats, while the lesser races fleed in terror and-\n\nHiram frowned. What was this? There were... goats... yes, goats practicing magic beyond anything he had seen before. They... they ruled over other races, nearly all of them. His kind, the equines, were subservient. But this, this wasn't the truth that he knew! He tried to turn away, to flee, but he could not move. He saw a glowing sphere approaching him, one with a goat's eye staring deep into his soul. The sheer malevolence in it was incomprehensible. He tried to scream, but he realized that he no longer had a mouth. He was a slave, and they were his masters. This was the ultimate truth."

hippone_sekrit.40.d: "The energies and forces at work were breathtaking to witness. The focusing crystals spun and shook with such intensity that some thought the entire place was going to be ripped apart in a magical maelstrom of untold proportions. The Equines of Gold, The Guide, and the Grandmasters watched as Hiram was slowly lifted into the air, all while the energy from thousands of crystals was being channeled into him. A bright white aura seemed to surround him as ripples in the air began to appear, almost as if the very fabric of reality itself was being torn asunder.\n\nSuddenly, a flash of light appeared from Hiram's chest, one that was so bright that it temporarily blinded those watching him. When they recovered, they saw that Hiram was no longer present, though the ripples in the air seemed to permeate all throughout the central square of Colthage.\n\nAs the mechanism powered down, there was silence. "Did... did it work?" One Equine of Gold asked. None answered him.\n\nJezalla blinked a couple of times, then raised her hoof, gesturing to the ripples, "Look around you, of course it worked! The Star Father has ascended and seized the mantle of the Godhead! He has transcended beyond mortality and escaped the cycle of life and rebirth that has trapped equines in the material world! He will fight Za'al-Maar in the immaterial world, and once our souls pass from our mortal coil, we too shall join him in eternal glory!"\n\nThere was brief hesitation among the equines present, but they soon nodded in assent. Of course Hiram had ascended. The ripples in the air were proof of that: the material world had to be damaged in order for him to break free of it.\n\n"We must rejoice!" cried Jezalla, rallying the others to her side, "The Godhead has been restored! Send word to everyone, everywhere! We have accomplished our ultimate goal!" The others joined in her cheers, then began to make preparations for a grand celebration of what had occurred in Colthage today.\n\nAll the while, a single zebra discreetly excused herself and made her way out of the city."

hippone_sekrit.41.t: "The Aftermath" #podrick
hippone_sekrit.41.d: "Somewhere, on the outskirts of a village far, far away from Colthage, a lone zebra was sitting next to a tree. The sky looked like it was about to rain, though she didn't pay any mind to that. Instead, she was deep in thought about what had occurred over the past several years.\n\nThe Guide remembered when she had first met Hiram back in school. How shy and bookish he had been, though he was passionate about his hobbies. They had become friends, so he decided to introduce her to his club, and then...\n\nShe looked up as she heard thunder rumble in the distance. Hiram was... gone, probably. She silently wondered if he had actually transcended or if he was just dead. There had been no word, nothing from beyond the material world. She did slightly alter the positioning of the focusing crystals, but she had a feeling that it wouldn't have changed the outcome at all.\n\nAs the first droplets of rain began to fall from the sky, the Guide realized something: She did not believe that the Ascendancy's goal was worth the costs. So many equines had died, and for what? There was no way for them to know if Hiram succeeded. The Ascendancy just believes that he did. And the avians... she reached a hoof down to her pouch, retrieving the photo given to her by that innkeeper. She sighed. Could what Zethro have said be true? That it was possible for an avian to be... good? Something to explore later, much later... if there were any avians left, that was.\n\nThe Guide thought back to what that wretch- that pegasus had said to her. "Elishat and Zethro died for nothing." She sat on that memory for a while.\n\n"I'm sorry." she said to the open air. The Guide hadn't bothered to find the Student's real name. Maybe the Student had been right about her, in a way. The Guide wondered if she was still alive, somehow. It wasn't like she could try to find the Student, the Guidance had abandoned her.\n\n"Hey miss!" called a voice to her left. The Guide turned her head to see a young filly, a unicorn running towards her. She was levitating two umbrellas. "The rain is gonna pick up! Here, take this!"\n\nWith a tired smile, the Guide accepted an umbrella. "Thank you, little one. What's your name?"\n\n"Calla Lily! What about you, miss? What's your name?""

hippone_sekrit.42.d: ""Remind me what this is again?", Hiram turned to Ocean Spray.\n\n"Well, it's a moonburger! The finest in state sponsored Chiropterran cuisine." Ocean Spray picked up a tray and hoofed it to the zebra in front of him.\n\nLooking down, Hiram saw a simple hamburger and fries, nothing special compared to what they have in Colthage, but nonetheless he was intrigued by this restaurant. Ocean Spray had been very insistent they eat here.\n\nSitting next to him, Spray pointed at the burger: "The coconut crab species that the burger is made from is extremely tenacious, and has been with the equines of Chiropterra for centuries. We have farmed them, rode them, even raised them as pets. And now they shall help in the rejuvenation of the state. The fries, are just fries." Spray bent his face into a crooked smile, seeming to be genuinely proud of this bizarre fast food establishment.\n\nHiram shrugged and thought that he might as well try it for the sake of this alliance. Picking up the burger, he took a bite and began to chew. He had to say, it was pretty good. The crab meat was tender and sweet, and the condiments complimented it quite well. It seemed to have a spicy mayonnaise topping that he enjoyed very much.\n\n"Well, Mr. Spray, I have to say your people have outdone themselves. We wouldn't normally allow such an establishment to exist in the Ascendancy, but I'd be willing to make an exception in this case, if you'll allow it."\n\nSpray smiled again. "Of course, Hiram!

### Country Leader Descriptions ###
CVA_HIRAM_ZERRANID_DESC: "§YBiography§!: Born to a rich patrician family in Hippone, Hiram Zerranid had an easy life and could focus freely on his studies. As an adult, he enrolled in the University of Hippone and studied history, philosophy, hippology and alchemy. During his time there, he joined a small, secret society and quickly rose through its ranks due to his charismatic nature, eventually becoming its leader. Over time this society slowly grew in numbers, though it likely would have remained as such that had the government not collapsed multiple times in quick succession.\n\nBy the end of the Second Colthaginian Civil War, Hiram's followers had grown from a small club to a legion of thousands. His teachings gave the aimless purpose and the destitute hope. Once he had gained enough support, he made the daring act of rebelling against Zarishat's regime under the pretense of her being unfit to rule. As a direct result of this, his influence skyrocketed and the knowledge of his beliefs spread throughout Colthage. To others he was no longer Hiram Zerranid, for his followers whispered a new name in reverence while his enemies cursed the title that he had come to be known by: The Star Father.\n\nNow that the Age of Strife has begun, only time will tell what will come of this mysterious zebra and his new religion. Will he be content with brutally cleansing his homeland of the "evil" he claims infests it, or will he strive for higher, more terrifying goals?\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

Once he had gained enough support, he made the daring act of refusing to accept Zarishat's regime under the pretense of her being unfit to rule. As a direct result of this, his influence skyrocketed and the knowledge of his beliefs spread throughout Colthage. To others he was no longer Hiram Zerranid, for his followers whispered a new name in reverence while his enemies cursed the title that he had come to be known by: The Star Father.\n\nNow with the Age of Strife in full swing, Hiram has become a changed zebra. Whereas before he would often remain indoors and speak through proxies, now he carries himself highly and walks among his flock. To all but his closest friends he has ceased to be a mere mortal, for his followers truly believe that he is on his way to becoming the Godhead.\n\nAll it will take is several million lives.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
HIE_CTH_THE_GODHEAD_DESC: "Though the alleged ascension of Hiram Zerranid was met with rapturous joy throughout the Ascendancy, he had left behind a void of leadership that needed to be filled. Thus, the Grandmasters and several well-renowned Equines of Gold formed the Council of the Godhead, a collective that rules the Ascendancy according to what they believe the Star Father would have wanted.\n\nOfficially, the Godhead is the head of the Ascendancy, though the Council of the Godhead has no means to communicate with Hiram beyond material world. Some say that he is busy doing battle with Za'al-Maar, others say that he is not able to speak to them for reasons unknown, and that they must remain faithful if they wish to hear from him.\n\nPerhaps the Council will remain in unity as they await a sign from Hiram, or perhaps they will never know for certain if he did ascend. Such is the matter of their faith, in the end.\n\nFor faith is belief in things that can never be proven." #podrick

Additionally, it can reduce one's ability to feel pleasure, leading to a devastating downward spiral if not handled carefully and in moderation.\n\n§0Repeated use of this potion can potentially ruin a marriage, as the side effects will steadily remove the affected's ability to feel pleasure, leading to the mindset of having to use more of the potion to get "results," leading to a greater loss of... you get the idea.

For example, if a user channels lightning through their own body while the potion's granted immunity to the elements dissipate, the user will receive the same effect of themselves being struck by pure lighting, leading to intense muscle spasms and death. Other examples can be drawn from different kinds of weather the user wield as the time.§!"

Such a power is dangerous, lethal even, but enticing all the same.\n\nCuriously though, when I brewed the mixture, I briefly saw an apparition of what appeared to be a very young dragon in the smoky flames. It looked almost... afraid? I never did ask my Guide how she obtained the heart of one, though I suppose it doesn't really matter. Cosmic Mistakes are not my concern.\n\nOne final note: The essence of the Ghost Pepper is surprisingly tasty. I'll need to add it to some of my personal recipes.\n\n-H"

This crystal, made from a Hoofful of Breezie Wings, Unbound Magic, and Water from the Holy Springs of Watertown, is quite probably the single most dangerous thing I have ever made. It kills almost any living creature that it touches by violently separating all of the magic from them and absorbing it.\n\nIn a moment of absent-mindedness, I almost picked it up to move it somewhere else. Could you imagine that, dying because of a simple lapse of judgement? It gives me the shivers, honestly. I've been given a morbid reminder to be more careful with my own mortality, as I still have much work to do.\n\n-H"

I have created a potion that can heal oneself by absorbing the emotions of those around them.\n\nIt is particularly fast-acting and effective compared to other healing potions, though it has the drawback of needing a sustained source of strong emotions near it to draw power from.

Namely, it boosts one's productivity and ability to be productive. I do not feel the need to elaborate on this, as I am above such things.\n\nIt's not to be used in battle, that's for certain.

I was able to create a potion that emulates this power for other equines.\n\nUpon her return with the ingredients, my most trusted Guide seemed troubled, as if she had suffered during her time in Griffonia. I know not what happened there, but I did assure her that the ingredients would be put to good use.\n\nAnd clearly they have been, as non-pegasi under the effects of this potion can manipulate lighting bolts almost like superheroes.

hippone_aspj_flavor.1.desc: "Zateo was too small, he couldn't see past the cheering throngs between him and the rhytmic thumping that the grand parade produced. Maybe he could try further along the route? Looking around, Zateo caught a look at a tiny back alley that the crowds were avoiding. Perfect! This was his way to get farther ahead in the parade. Dashing down the alleyway, Zateo thought of what he would see. The famed equines of silver in their masks, sacrificing their individualities to serve the grand ideas of the Ascendancy! Of course, Zateo didn't quite understand what that all meant, but he knew he should be proud of them.\n\nRounding the final corner, Zateo bounded up a small hill to exit the alley before his hoof caught on a rock jutting out the side of a building. Tripping over, Zateo came crashing down on his front right knee, scraping it badly and causing it to bleed profusely. As he tried to stand, Zateo could only wince in pain as he watched the blood seeping into the cobblestones. On the edge of tears, Zateo began to call out, "Help! Please, I'm hurt!" But no creature was around. Every loyal citizen of the Ascendancy was at the parade. So the young zebra curled up and tried to apply pressure to the wound. It wouldn't be fatal, he thought, but he'd be there a while.\n\n"Well, what's this then?" Zateo turned to face the new voice. Looking from where he came, he saw a hooded zebra mare holding a satchel over her shoulder. "That looks painful. Would you like some help?" Eager to get out of the situation, Zateo nodded as the mare walked over and pulled off her hood. As she applied gauze and an alchemical tonic to his knee, all he could notice was her deep purple-colored mane.\n\n"There, all done!" she said after applying the potion. Watching the wound heal at incredible speed, Zateo could scarcely believe his eyes. "Now then, try to be more careful next time."\n\n"Wait!" Zateo called out as she went to leave, "I haven't caught your name, good miss, my father would want to know who had healed my wounds."\n\nThe mare turned back for a second, before pulling up her hood and simply saying, "No one. Just a helpful guide." And then just as quickly as she had come, the mare was gone."
hippone_aspj_flavor.1.a: "Well, thanks miss!"

hippone_aspj_flavor.2.t: "Fate Of The Damned"
hippone_aspj_flavor.2.desc: ""Useless Za'al-Maar afflicted avians," the officer muttered. "Twenty-one god damn hours, and he still refuses to talk." Taking off his mask, the officer walked over to his chair in the Colthage Municipal Securities division office, which housed the military police of the city of Colthage. Kicking a trash can by his desk over, the officer plopped himself down with a huff, and he went to the paperwork at his desk. This Avian had been found with government documents trying to flee the city. He wished from deep down inside his heart that he could just end the hippogriff's life, but orders from the top said he needed info. Shaking his head, he could still hear his partner going at it in the other room. The prisoner's wail's of pain brought him some joy, at least. If the Avian wouldn't talk, they'd just hurt him more.\n\nLooking down at his paperwork, he was shocked when he looked up to see a hooded zebra in front of him. Shooting up, he grabbed for his sidearm before he recognized the face under the hood. The purple-haired zebra.\n\n"Ah, I see you finally noticed me." She quipped. "I had hope that the city's defenders were a bit more alert."\n\nThe officer inhaled and exhaled slowly. He was in a foul mood, but now was not the time to mouth off to an Equine of Gold, "I apologize for my failure, miss. What brings you to our station?"\n\n"Orders from the palace of the Teacher. That prisoner is to be transferred to my care immediately. My squad will be here tomorrow morning at 09.00 to pick it up." And then, as quickly as she came, she was gone.\n\nThe officer smirked and then began to chuckle. That's what that prisoner deserves! Everyone knows what happens to those who go with the purple-haired zebra! They become soulless husks of themselves before they finally meet the fate of all Avian scum. Serves him right for not answering their questions. If endless torture is a fate worse than death, then there are no words to describe her cursed embrace."

hippone_aspj_flavor.3.desc: "Pulling back her hood and releasing her purple mane, the Guide got a better look at the door in front of her. It was simple, but she knew that the Star Father's personal lab was behind it. The Equines of Silver who had escorted her here were instructed to leave when they were a full forty paces away. Knocking three times, the Guide took a step back, not sure of what would happen. She had met Hiram before, but not like this. This was an official summons, entirely different to what she was used to. As the door opened, the Guide was shocked, but not for the reasons she thought she might be.\n\n"Ah, my dearest Guide! Come in, come in!" Hiram smiled warmly and invited the Guide in. He was disheveled and dirty, covered in muck and stains. Hiram had converted the room into a mixture of a laboratory and a greenhouse and was tending to his plants when she arrived. "Apologies for my appearance," Hiram muttered to himself, "I must have lost track of time."\n\n"My teacher, you must rest! The nation relies on you being of sound mind." the Guide managed to sputter out a few words. \n\nHiram glared at her, "Are you insinuating I am not of sound mind?" But before the Guide could even respond, Hiram waved a hoof at her and continued, "Don't worry, I know you meant it as a joke." Moving around the room, Hiram stripped himself of his gardening apron and gloves, returned to the Guide, and sat her down at a chair by his desk, looking far more official.\n\n"Now, my good Guide, I have a task for you."\n\nShe nodded, "Anything you command."\n\nHiram smiled and continued, "I have a dream, a dream of alchemy on a scale never before attempted. Potions that could change the very forces of reality. All the power of the fragments of the Godhead, fractured into the races of equinity, their pure essence made manifest into concoctions, mighty weapons to smite the avian!" Hiram's voice began to peak, booming with the rhetoric of all his lectures. "I believe that these potions, all of them at once, could together form enough of the essence of the Godhead that an individual, pure of spirit and ascended in mind, body, and soul, could truly become one with the spirit realm again."\n\nHiram paused, and turned to the Guide, "Will you help me?""

It left a lasting impression on me, and I feel that it will take some time for me to recover. I ask that you not worry about me, though.

hippone_aspj_flavor.10.desc: "Hello, my Teacher.\n\nEquestria has proven to be more interesting than I anticipated. It seems like everywhere I go, there is something new to discover about the residents here. I even had a sincere moment of self-reflection with the aid of a Cosmic Mistake, can you believe that?\n\nJust thinking on that, I had an idea about an interesting mix. Could you try combining the "aspects of two small animals, along with an edible ingredient?" I feel like something truly devastating could be made from these.\n\nThank you for granting me the opportunity to come here,\n\n-Your Most Humble Guide"

There is too much pain there.\n\nThat said, I believe that a potion could be brewed from "one ingredient related to flight, another related to electricity, and a third ingredient collected from Griffonia."\n\nI do have one request, though. Do you think it would be possible to commemorate a late Equine of Silver who assisted me in obtaining all of the ingredients from Griffonia? I would greatly appreciate it.\n\n-Your Most Humble Guide"

hippone_jrnl_eq.1.t: "A Stroke of Fortune" #lily
hippone_jrnl_eq.1.desc: "It was on the seventh day that the expedition party had its first stroke of fortune. One of the Equines of Silver had spotted a flash of brilliant emerald green and deep sea blue among the sooty gray that made up the landscape of this part of the dragon island. At this point, the party was anxious for any lead, as they had yet to see any dragon, large or small, on their trip thus far. Thus, they sailed to the area where the stallion had spotted the flash of color an hour prior.\n\n"We have found tracks, my lady Guide," a Master of Silver began, kneeling as he did, "headed due west along the beach, only a few hours old. It appears to be those of a juvenile dragon, separated from the rest of its kind."\n\n"Well done, commander," the Guide replied, "It appears that your legionnaires have good eyesight. Ready your troops, we'll head out at once."\n\nWith a nod, the Equine stalked off towards the ship, barking orders to resupply and be ready to march. The Guide found her eyes drawn to the sky once more, searching for the telltale sign of a dragon's passage overhead, but the sky remained mercifully clear. Even a singular adult would be too much for her small band to manage, but a juvenile? She felt her mouth split into the beginnings of a grin."
hippone_jrnl_eq.1.a: "A juvenile would be just perfect."

hippone_jrnl_misc.0.t: "Embers" #lily
hippone_jrnl_misc.0.desc: "It had taken the better part of the day before the search party caught up with its elusive prey. It had been a simple matter to track it; the creature had made little effort to conceal its path, and the expert scouts that accompanied her made child's play of the effort. Now, a cave lay before them, with a soft glow emanating from its entrance alongside a mournful sniffling. Holding up a hoof for quiet, the Guide stalked ahead alone past the mouth of the cave into the hillside beyond.\n\nA dragon that was curled into a ball inside the cave around a small, poorly made campfire. It was unmistakably a juvenile; it was much smaller than a fully grown dragon and did not yet have a pair of wings, yet at the same time it stood about as tall as any adult zebra. A quick glance showed it to be in good shape for its age, with an excellent physique, and a pallor that spoke of good organ functionality. It was the perfect specimen.\n\nAs the Guide stalked forwards, she kicked a stray pebble on the floor, and the dragon unfurled with a shot, tears in its eyes. "H-hello?" it spoke into the darkness, a waver in its voice, "I-is anyone there? Please, I need help."\n\nThe Guide strode forwards into the light of the flames. "Do not be afraid, little one," she bade, acutely aware of the knife concealed beneath her cloak.\n\nThe dragon's tears continued unabated, and it sniffled as it struggled to speak. "Can you help me? I fell off my mama's back and got hurt, and now I'm lost. I don't know where they went and it hurts."\n\n"Yes, little one," the Guide spoke, creeping ever closer, "I will help you find your mother."\n\n"D-do you promise?" the dragon asked, a note of hope coming into its voice.\n\n"I promise," the Guide lied. She put one hoof on the dragon's shoulder, as if to bring it in for a hug, and with one swipe she brought the knife along the dragon's neck.\n\nIt was over in moments, and the sobbing subsided."

# Hjortland Expedition
hippone_jrnl_eq.2.t: "An Unexpected Angle" #lily
hippone_jrnl_eq.2.desc: "A sudden crash and series of muttered curses snapped the Guide out of the book she was reading. She was seated at a desk in a small flat her expedition had rented for their stay in Hjortland, paging through tome after tome in an effort to track down one of the ingredients that she needed for the Teacher's potions: the tears of a Hydra. The results so far had been... frustrating, to say the least.\n\n"And what do you think that you're doing?" she snapped at the careless Equine of Silver behind her. The mare was standing over what had once been a neat pile of books, that were now strewn every which way on the floor.\n\nThe Mare snapped to a sudden attention at the scrutiny. "A-apologies, ma'am, I mean, my lady Guide. I was just thinking-"\n\n"You are of the caste of Silver, not of the caste of Gold," the Guide interrupted, "you're not supposed to think, but to be a dumb brute that will keep me safe." The Guide paused, weighing her options. She hadn't been having much luck finding any information on her own. If this mare had a good idea, that made life easier, and if she didn't, well, then she could always be sent back to Colthage for reeducation. She sighed. "Say your piece," she ordered.\n\n"Yes my lady," the Equine yelped, somehow managing to stand even straighter, "I was just thinking about the bedtime stories my ma used to tell me, about boogeymares living under the bridge, and thought that maybe any place with something as scary as a hydra might tell some stories about that?"\n\nThe Guide stood still for a moment, processing, before diving into the stack to find a book of fairy tales that she had acquired on a whim. Flipping through, she settled on a tale that took place in- "The swamp," she uttered aloud, flipping back to an almanac of Olenia. "There," she said, placing her hoof on a large, swampy area, "Karpalosuot." She smiled, her face flush with triumph, and the Equine returned the expression. "What is your name, legionnaire?" she asked."

hippone_jrnl_eq.3.t: "An Unorthodox Plan"
hippone_jrnl_eq.3.desc: "It had taken several days by hoof for the hills of the Olenian highlands to slowly make way to the marshes of Karpalosuot. The journey itself had been rather simple, but by the time that the landscape made way to fetid, stinking pools of stagnant water, everyzebra's nerves were beginning to grow thin.\n\n"It occurs to me," the Guide said, ducking underneath a low hanging branch with an undignified grunt, "that we have yet to discuss what to do when we actually reach the creature that we have been seeking."\n\n"What is there to discuss, my lady?" a Master of Silver grunted in response, "simple force of arms will force the creature into submission, whereupon we may harvest the creature for its tears at our leisure."\n\n"I worry about our band's ability to fell such a foe," the Guide replied, "the hydra is said to be a large creature, and while I don't doubt the prowess of your troops, I do worry that we simply don't have enough zebras to confront such a creature."\n\n"Why do we need to fight at all?" a voice chimed in from the rear of the formation. The Guide turned to see Elishat, the zebra who had given her the clue to locate the Hydra, was the one who had spoken up.\n\nThe Master of Silver grew incensed at the interruption. "Quiet, you!" he snapped, but the Guide cut him off.\n\n"Let her speak," bade the Guide, "Elishat, explain yourself. How do you propose to get tears from this creature without conflict?"\n\n"Well," Elishat begin, collecting her thoughts, "poetry always made me sad. Maybe we can read the hydra some sad poetry to make it cry."\n\nThe Guide ran the idea through her head. It was foolish, but it was just foolish enough to work. "Fine. Commander," she ordered, "send one of your legionnaires to find the saddest poem that they can find.""
hippone_jrnl_eq.3.a: "If this doesn't work, we'll fight."

hippone_jrnl_misc.1.t: "An Unforeseen Result" #lily
hippone_jrnl_misc.1.desc: ""Oh, how I compare thee to a fetid breeze!" the Guide began, orating from the scroll that she held in her hooves. The Equines of Silver had returned from their expedition into town with a collection of poems that they claimed, as per the merchants they had purchased them from, would "charm the hide off of even a changeling."\n\nStill, the Guide couldn't help but feel rather foolish. She was standing knee deep on the banks of a great pool of stagnant water, proclaiming poetry that wasn't even sad to nothing she could see. She could feel that this was the right place, however, and mastered any feelings of embarrassment.\n\n"Thy breath smells like a putrescent cabbage," the Guide continued, "and thine visage is compared to a slug of the sea! Thy scent may be compared to an unwashed loon, whose presence is as welcome as that of a cock at dawn!"\n\nAt once, a great rumbling overtook the area. Great limbs flew from the swamps, and a many headed hydra appeared before the Guide and the assembled party.\n\n"Oh how I love thine many heads!" the Guide spoke, unabated, as if reciting a bit of sorcery. She spoke as if at rote, "Each head more foolish than the last, and each more putrid! I can barely stand within the presence of ye, that ye are so repulsive!"\n\nThe hydra stood menacingly above the assembled host of zebras. It stood many heads above the assembled group, and it was all the Guide could do to not tremble at the sight. She took a deep breath, gathered her thoughts, and continued the poem. "Despite how terrible ye may be, I still wish to be with thee! I wish to adulate within thy weathered brows, and to live within thy measured gaze. For though thy may stink, and scare with abandon, thine will always be mine."\n\nThe clearing was quiet. The Guide stood still, sweating with effort, as the hydra seemed to almost consider the words. It let out a laugh, a great guffaw, and at once the swamp was alight with the great heaving laughter of the hydra that stood before them. The Guide strode forward, sensing what was about to happen, and held out a flask as a singular tear fell from the hydra's eye."

It was the first thing that the Guide noticed as she stepped off the ship onto the bustling docks of the port city; the brine in the air from the ocean mingled poorly with the smog emanating from within the depths of the hive. Trying not to gag, she quickly unscrewed a potion from her belt, the scent of the poultice blocking out the rest. The guide turned to Elishat, herself walking down to the docks, but the fellow zebra paid no heed, instead scanning the city for any signs of threat. "I do not like this place, my lady Guide," she said, "Are we sure these changelings can be trusted?"\n\n"General Cardo is a respected associate of the Teacher," the Guide admonished, "and changelings themselves are equine."\n\n"Equine or not, there's something wrong with this place, something that I can't quite put my hoof on," Elishat responded, "I don't trust it."\n\n"You worry too much," the Guide chided gently, a smile in her voice. She expected little difficulty in finding the next two items that the Teacher had requested, especially with the promised help of such a decorated general as Lacin Cardo himself.\n\nThe changeling in question stood at the head of the docks, flanked by soldiers of his own. "It is with great honor that I welcome you and your party to the Changeling Lands, Lady Guide," he said, his face inscrutable.\n\nThe Guide gave a slight smile in response to the address. "Please, the honor is mine. We have traveled far to be here, and are eager to begin our journey."\n\nThe general nodded. "In due time, my lady. For now, why don't you and your companions rest?" He gestured to his soldiers, who began to march down the docks. "My changelings here will show your soldiers to their quarters. In the meanwhile, why don't you and I explore the Hive? I'm sure that your Star Father has much to gain from a more formal partnership with the Queendom."\n\nThe Guide tried to hide a grimace. More time in this smelly hive? She supposed she could bear it for a while. They had been on that ship for a long time after all."

At first, the Guide had felt almost insulted at getting the cold shoulder, and wanted to wait for her companion to make the first move. Now, however, the Guide simply wanted her Elishat back.\n\nElishat, for her part, looked surprised at being addressed. "Nothing troubles me, my lady Guide," she responded. Elishat paused, almost a half second too long, and the Guide frowned slightly. "Why, do you sense something wrong?"\n\n"No, I just-" the Guide stammered, trying to find the words. "Is this about the changelings? I know you didn't trust them, are you upset with me for allying with them?"\n\nElishat blinked. "No, my lady," she responded, "I could never be angry with you. And you were right to trust the changelings, they have been nothing but helpful so far."\n\nThe Guide sighed. General Cardo and his entourage had been rather useful, she could admit, but she found herself starting to agree with Elishat's original mistrust. Something seemed incredibly wrong, and she couldn't put her hoof on it.\n\nElishat coughed. "Will that be all, my lady?"\n\n"What?" the Guide asked, startled out of her recollection, "I- yes, that will be all."\n\nElishat nodded, falling silently behind to the rear of the column.

# Manehattan expedition
hippone_jrnl_eq.7.t: "Welcome to the Big Apple" #lily
hippone_jrnl_eq.7.desc: "The sprawl of the city that lay before her was unlike anything the Guide had ever seen before.\n\nThe port city of Manehattan had been selected as the perfect point of entry into the sprawling Equestrian nation. It was a huge metropolitan city, and while the thought of being in such close proximity to avians disgusted her, she could admit that the multiracial makeup of the city would make it easy for a lone zebra to blend in.\n\nShe had booked passage on a container ship destined for the metropolis, opting to travel separately from her expeditionary party so as to avoid any suspicion. As the ship sailed past the Statue of Friendship, she could barely contain her sense of awe at the skyline that seemed to stretch for miles. Giant towers of steel and glass like she had never seen before seemed to reach into the sky as in supplication to the gods above. It was impressive, somewhat intimidating sight, and for once, the Guide found herself feeling rather small.\n\nA small patrol boat led the Guide's ship into port, docking at an otherwise unoccupied pier. Disembarking with a word of thanks to the captain, she trotted up the dock towards a mercifully small line in front of a small checkpoint, a small sign hung above it labled simply "Customs."\n\nAt the head of the line was a stallion, equine, thankfully, wearing an easygoing smile. "Hey, how's it goin?" he asked, his accent strange to the Guide's ears. He ripped a page off the pad of paper in front of him. "Name?"\n\n"You may refer to me as the Guide."\n\nThe stallion's smile didn't fade, but it seemed to freeze on his face as he gave her a long, discerning look. "Okay," he said, drawing out the end of the word, "and what brings you to Manehattan today miss Guide?"\n\n"Business, of a sort," she responded, ignoring the look on the stallion's face, "I'm meeting a friend of mine here."\n\n"Well, let me be the first to welcome you to our great city," the stallion said, passing her a signed slip of paper."

hippone_jrnl_misc.3.desc: "The safehouse was located in Bronclyn, one of Manehattan's outer boroughs. Compared to the bright lights and bustle of the city proper, Bronclyn was more down to earth: not subdued, per say, but more modest.\n\nThe particular neighborhood that the Guide found herself in seemed to be populated entirely by thestrals, the bat-ponies out and about despite the late hour. The safehouse itself was a modest building, some five stories high. The other members of the expedition party had gathered here at the behest of their benefactor, a certain thestral by the name of Starry Glory.\n\nThe thestral in question sat alone with the Guide in a small sitting room at the top floor of the safehouse. The two had been deliberating for the better part of an hour, and it seemed as if the thestral had finally come to some kind of conclusion.\n\n"Bales," Starry said, placing a hoof onto the map sitting on the table in front of them. "It's got the greatest libraries in Equestria, if not the world. If you can't find information on what you're looking for there, then the information just doesn't exist."\n\nThe Guide strode over, humming as she went. "Perusing through so many tomes might be more difficult than you think, especially searching without aim. I must confess that I am unfamiliar with how you Equestrians categorize information."\n\nThe thestral waved off any concerns. "Don't worry about that, I have a buddy who works as a librarian there, one of the few thestrals to hold the position," he said with a note of pride, "He'd be more than willing to help us out."\n\n"I guess that's settled, then," the Guide said, rising to her hooves."

hippone_jrnl_eq.8.desc: "The many libraries of Bales had been as useful as Starry Glory had suggested.\n\nThe Guide found herself surrounded by piles of books, as various equines of all shapes and sizes constantly added and removed from the stack with a frightening pace. It was as if she was serviced by an entire army of Equines of Gold; she knew that she would always think fondly of this place.\n\nHer time among the stacks had been incredibly useful thus far, and she had located just about everything that she needed to find. Parasprites would be easy to find, as they were everywhere in Equus, but it was mentioned that a particularly large concentration of them could be found in the sleepy town of Hollow Shades.\n\nThe Dust of Starfall, on the other hoof, would be harder to find. The tomes that she had read mentioned the city of Stalliongrad, a city that the Guide was not particularly eager to visit. Stalliongrad was the city of the crypto-avian marksists, equines who had fully surrendered to the foul influence of Za'al-Maar. She shuddered at the thought. She would visit, of course, as the Teacher demanded, but she'd be lying if she said that she was anticipating the trip with any particular gladness.\n\nAnother location that came up frequently in her search was the small village of Ponyville. It sat on the Everfree forest, a woodland known for its abundance of alchemical reagents. It was also supposed to be incredibly frightening, though the Guide doubted that she would be so easily rattled as the average pony.\n\nThe Guide shut the book in front of her, letting out a long sigh. Ponyville and the Everfree forest would have to wait until the end of her trip. Now, the choice of destination lay before her."

hippone_jrnl_eq.9.t: "A Simple Task" #lily
hippone_jrnl_eq.9.desc: ""So I have to ask: why the Hollow Shades?"\n\nThe Guide started, Starry Glory's voice cutting abruptly through the quiet of the night. The two had been walking in what she had assumed to be amicable silence, though from the fidgeting of her companion she could tell that the comfort had been one-sided. "What do you mean?"\n\n"I mean, it's not like parasprites are all that hard to find. I was wondering why we came here, since the Hollow Shades are a bit out of the way."\n\nThe Guide shrugged. "It was close to Bales, and there was a confirmed infestation not too long ago," she answered after a moment at the thestral's expectant look. "Mere happenstance, I assure you. Why the curiosity?"\n\nStarry Glory's face was unreadable. "I was wondering if it had to do anything with the Pony of Shadows."\n\n"I cannot say that I'm familiar with the title," the Guide admitted.\n\n"Not a title so much as a mantle, or a name- hmm," Starry Glory started, struggling to find the words, "He is- was, rather, an avatar of the Lady Nightmare. He was powerful: holding but a shard of the princess's power, he was able to hold his own against the assembled pillars of harmony. He was the avatar of Her might, and he gave it up, and all for what? Friendship?"\n\nThe Guide stood silently, taken aback by the normally genial pony's sudden outburst. She felt like she should feel the same, but a persistent feeling in the back of her head, a distant sensation wondering- a speck of blue in the corner of her eye caught her attention, and the Guide quickly scooped up the parasprite and put it in a bottle."
hippone_jrnl_eq.9.a: "But the distant feeling never went away."

hippone_jrnl_eq.10.t: "Welcome to Ponyville" #lily
hippone_jrnl_eq.10.desc: "Starry Glory had left her some time ago. Muttering something about the "snooty ponies living there," the thestral had said his goodbyes and left the Guide with her Silver Equine guards, letting her make her own way to the admittedly unremarkable village. It was small, by Equestrian standards, with the only notable attraction being an impressive tree-shaped crystalline castle. Hawkers peddled their wares along the main thoroughfare, with ponies selling everything from apples and apple products to fine clothing. The peddlers' cries died slightly as they caught sight of the eclectic procession of Zebras before them, thinly disguised anxiety writ plain on their faces, but many quickly found their courage, the apple vendors in particular even approaching the Guide directly.\n\n"Here ya go, miss!" a young filly cried, hoofing the Guide a deep red apple, "Once you try this, you'll never want an apple from any other orchard again!"\n\nWith the ice broken, other merchants came up to the group, proffering samples of their merchandise to the Guide and her guards, their generosity disregarding the differences of status. The merchants seemed to be trying to outdo each other in terms of their offerings, each trying to be the first to get the group to spend their bits.\n\nFinding herself quickly covered in an ever growing pile of silks, candies, and flowers, the Guide glanced around for an avenue of escape. She spotted a darker alleyway, and with a harried "This way!" she threw an alchemical smoke bomb against the ground. With a tinkling of glass a thick cloud of smoke covered the still growing crowd, and the Guide managed to push her way past the now-coughing ponies that surrounded her on all sides.\n\nSprinting through the alleyway, the Guide felt the Guidance direct her towards an inn. Utterly exhausted from her ordeal, she made her way over."

She had sent a few of the Equines of Silver to ask around and gather information, but few of the ponies knew enough about alchemy to know what might be considered a useful reagent. It was infuriating, but she had little choice other than to sit and rest.\n\nBut the time for rest seemed to be over now. The Guidance had pulled her quite insistently a little ways out of town, to what almost appeared to be some kind of path leading through a lightly forested woodland.\n\nThe Guidance was almost painful, now, and the Guide was panting as she tried to get to where she was so urgently needed. She came to rest at a clearing, the Guidance pointing her to a small, fluffy creature sitting peacefully in the middle. A rabbit of some kind? No, she realized.\n\nA jackalope.\n\nOf course, the horns would make for the perfect balancing agent to many of her more unstable potions. Creeping forward, she drew her knife, walking silently with a hoof raised to strike-\n\nThe crack of a twig caused the jackalope's head to pop up, its eyes widening in alarm. With a hop, it jumped out of the way of the Guide's swing and she tumbled to the ground in a heap. Blowing an errant strand of hair from her face, the Guide scrambled to her hooves, gesturing angrily at the fleeing creature."

Surprisingly so. The Guide's contingent of Equines of Silver was barely able to do more than to keep pace with the creature, let alone the Guide herself. The second factor was the jackalope's almost preternatural ability to sense when a strike was coming. It would have been impressive, were it not absolutely infuriating.\n\nAs it stood, the Guide had little but murder on her mind, and the Jackalope led them on a not so merry chase back to town. The Jackalope took them back up the main thoroughfare in town, ducking and weaving through startled passers-by along the way. The less nimble Guide and her entourage were forced to push their way through, biting out curses as they tried to clear the way.\n\nThe Guide, thoroughly enraged, spat out orders to the zebras around her. "Flank left down the alley! I want that thing dead!"\n\nEventually, they cornered the beast. It sat at the end of an alleyway, quivering in fear, as the Guide approached with an almost maniacal smile, knife in hoof."

"It's haunted," one had told her, "Nothing kind or good lives there. Everything in the forest can and will try to hurt you, or worse."\n\nNeedless to say, the Guide had not gotten to where she was by listening to scared ponies. Having briefly scouted the outskirts of the forest, she had determined that the best course of action would be to just go it alone. The rough, boggy terrain would be horrible on her more heavily armed Equines of Silver, and she'd be quick enough to get in and out as needed.\n\nIt had all gone wrong rather quickly.\n\nThe forest was dark, even during the day, and visibility was incredibly low. An errant branch had torn at her bandolier, and a good portion of her potions had fallen to the ground. She watched helplessly as the mixtures pooled on the ground, and the resulting explosion sent her tumbling off a cliff into a river below.\n\nTrying desperately to claw to the surface, she was forced to cut the tattered remains of her cloak as it got tangled around her. She surfaced, gasping for breath, and swam to shore. She lay there panting, and felt a shadow loom over her. Glancing up, she saw- was that a zebra?\n\n"What is this, that has washed on the shore?" the strange zebra said, her voice taking an odd cadence, "Someone new, or something more?""

It was undoubtedly the home of an alchemist, though the Guide couldn't tell if she had been classically trained or learned on her own.\n\n"It has been some time, you see," Zecora began, her tone almost uncertain, "Since I've met someone from the old country. Tell me stranger, from where do you hail? From what foreign port did you set sail?"\n\n"I-" the Guide took a moment to parse the words, "Colthage. Or, the Ascendancy now."\n\n"Strange rumors have come from there," Zecora hummed, "Once a kind land, but no longer so fair. Tell me stranger, be you a refugee?" the zebra's eyes grew hard, assessing, "If something else, I suggest you flee."\n\nThe Guide shivered. "Yes, I'm a refugee," she lied, "Colthage, it's... It's no longer what it used to be."\n\nThe other zebra's eyes softened. "I believe that I begin to see. Though why have you come to the Everfree?"\n\n"Reagents," she admitted, "I'm an alchemist, much like yourself. A bog like this would be perfect for what I'm trying to do, but things didn't quite go as planned." She paused, feeling the whisper of the Guidance in the corner of her mind. "Actually," she asked haltingly, "Do you have enough to spare from your stocks? I think I've had enough adventure for one day."\n\nZecora stared at her, assessing. Finally, the zebra nodded. "Indeed," she said, "Please take what you need."\n\nThe Guide pretended to look around, instead feeling for the Guidance to direct her. She came to a stop in front of a nearly empty jar.

Stained glass littered the floor, and rot had consumed the ceiling some ages past, leaving the stars to shine down on the room. Looking up, she felt the Guidance start to sing as she caught sight of a silhouette among the stars. It was the tantabus, she realized. As she tried to figure out a way to get to it, the creature took notice of her, and jumped down. She felt the world start to shift-\n\nShe is in Colthage. Hiram's study. Her Teacher stands there, his voice booming throughout the hall. "There are three. Those that are pure, those that are foul, and those that were never meant to be.

hippone_jrnl_eq.13.t: "Free Passage Through a Red Land"
hippone_jrnl_eq.13.desc: "When the Guide had first passed the border separating Equestria and Stalliongrad, she had expected to feel something. Stalliongrad was the greatest stronghold of crypto-avian marksism on Equus, if not the world. Za'al-Maar's influence should have been invested heavily here, yet the Guide could sense nothing.\n\nPerhaps the influence of the great enemy was more subtle than she had anticipated.\n\nNevertheless, the Guide, alongside Starry Glory and the rest of her entourage, had been traveling north along the coastline for about a week. They had been trotting in the direction of a small village that had been mentioned several times in the tomes from Bales. When they finally arrived, they had managed to speak to one of the braver ponies residing there, a mare who introduced herself as Salty Breeze.\n\n"Yes, I know what it is that you are seeking," she said, speaking in between a stalk of barley. The Guide had been hailed by the mare when they were a small ways away outside of the village, curious as to why such a motley crew had come so far out into the middle of nowhere. When they had mentioned what they were after, her cheerful expression had grown somber. "It was a little over three months ago. Some of the local boys were out fishing, and they heard a big boom. Something struck a small island nearby, just a few miles off the coast there, and a tidal wave from the impact knocked their skiff over. Two of them, they didn't make it back," she said. The mare hung her head low, giving a small sigh. "The rest of the boys say the island's different now, cursed. They have also seen some strange boats around the area" At this, a look of genuine concern entered the pony's face. "If you all are going out there, you must be careful, yes? No telling what might happen."\n\nThe Guide was shocked at the level of compassion that Salty Breeze had shown them. This was somepony who had willingly given themselves over to the enemy? She shook her head. It wasn't important. They had their destination, and that was all that mattered."

hippone_jrnl_misc.7.t: "The Tainted Isle"
hippone_jrnl_misc.7.desc: "The island lay completely still.\n\nGone was the song of the crickets that had been ever present on the mainland. The whisper of wind through the trees was absent, replaced only by the last gasp of a dying mare. Even the sound of the crashing of the waves grew silent as the party drew their anchors and landed on the island's shores, and all that remained was the sound of soft breathing, and the beating of the Guide's heart.\n\nIt grew obvious to the Guide that a great magical calamity had fallen upon the tiny islet, likely during the starfall that had brought them here. The land itself had seemed to take on an alien appearance. The grass lay flat on the ground, each blade seeming to point away from the epicenter of the fall. The trees grew at unusual angles, the branches forming fractal patterns of the trunks that they sprang from. The Guide could see no signs of any wildlife; there were no tracks, no droppings, not even a leaf out of place.\n\n"Well this is suitably ominous," Starry Glory quipped, a smirk on his face.\n\n"Quiet," the Guide snapped, "we do not have time for foolishness. The sooner that we get the Dust of Starfall, the sooner we can leave."\n\nOrdering two of her Equines of Silver to remain behind to guard the ship, she took the rest of the party towards the center of the island.\n\nThe closer that the party got to the center, however, the stranger the island seemed to become. The paths they took seemed to wander, and anypony who left sight of the main group often found themselves away from where they thought they were. The grass began to shimmer in the night sky, and the water collecting in the pools took on magical hues, inviting those who looked to peer closer into their depths.\n\nEventually, the Guide and her party reached the center of the island. The fallen star lay in a large crater, glowing faintly in the stillness of the night. Starry stepped forwards, but the Guide lay her hoof across his chest, her eyes widening."

What do you think, do you have any voodoo magic to take that thing down?"\n\nThe Guide grimaced. "My potions may be powerful, but they're certainly not enough to take down an Ursa Major. No, the best thing to do is to sneak around it and collect the Dust of Starfall without waking the beast." She hummed, thinking for a moment, and turned fully to the thestral standing beside her. "I need you to fly me down there."\n\n"What?" Starry yelped. He gulped, glancing back down to the Ursa Major, still sleeping, thankfully, and continued in a more quiet tone. "Are you crazy? I can't carry you down there, you're too heavy." The Guide gave him a look, and the thestral looked away, stammering, "I mean, just-" he took a breath, "Why don't I just fly down there and grab it myself?"\n\n"You don't know what to get," the Guide said. Unspoken was the assertion that she simply didn't trust him. "It has to be me."\n\nGrimacing, the Thestral grabbed the Guide under her hooves, and the Guide pretended to ignore the comments about her weight. The two flew into the pit, hovering over the rock, and the Guide collected a few motes of dust emanating from the star. Silently, she held the flask up to the thestral, who took it as his cue to leave. As he began to fly away, however, a strong wind blew through the pit, and the thestral lost his grip, dropping the Guide onto the head of the gargantuan monster.\n\nTumbling off the beast's snout, the Guide impacted the ground with a huff. Holding her breath, she could only watch as the great beast's eyes slowly opened, staring directly at her.\n\n"Run," she whispered.\n\nShe shot to her hooves and scrambled out of the pit as quickly as her hooves would take her. "Run!" she shouted to the assembled equines. Not caring if they followed her or not, she glanced behind her as the creature stood to its full height, blotting out the moon. It let out a roar that shook the foundations of the very earth.\n\nThe Guide turned back. Racing down to where the ship had docked, she saw that the two zebras she had left behind had already begun to weigh the anchor, and was pulling out slowly. She took a running leap onto the boat and promptly collapsed, breathing heavily at the exertion. Starry Glory landed next to her, and she turned to him."

hippone_jrnl_eq.14.desc: "When she returned to Ponyville, the Guide got on a train.\n\nThe trip to Appleloosa, what was hopefully the final trek of her Equestrian expedition, was uncharacteristically relaxing. After having spent months on hoof in the wilderness, the comfort of public transportation felt like decadence.\n\nIt did, however, give her quite a bit of time to think. The nightmare from the castle had visited her each night, the horrible images haunting her, and the morning offered little relief. She relived that first night in the dragon isles, remembering how she felt nothing as she cut the heart from the child. How had she been so callous?\n\nFeeling the train slow as they reached their destination was a welcome relief. As the Guide stepped out into the warm midday air, she felt the Guidance direct her to the town. She saw ponies going about their business, their only cares wrapped up within the confines of their small lives.\n\nAnd then she saw the Buffalo.\n\nShe could hardly believe her eyes, but they were there. Cosmic mistakes, working together with Equines like equals. They were equals, she realized, in every way that mattered. They were people, Equine or not, and wasn't that what really mattered? Then the Guidance shifted, directing her out into the setting Sun."

hippone_jrnl_misc.9.desc: "The Guidance led her through the countryside for the better part of the day, until she came to a lone campfire. By it sat a lone buffalo, staring serenely into the sunset. He was large, larger than most of his kind, but held himself with a gentle air.\n\nThe Guide walked over, and sat down next to him. He said nothing, offering only a kind smile as greeting, and they sat together in silence for a time.\n\n"What do you do," the Guide asked quietly, when the silence became too much to bear, "when you've made a mistake?"\n\nThe buffalo chuckled, a warm, sonorous sound. "Why," he answered, as if it were the most simple thing in the world, "you make it right, of course."\n\n"What if the mistake is too big to be made right?" she asked, feeling small.\n\n"In my experience, very little is too large to be made right given time, diligence, and dedication," he said. Grunting, he rose to his hooves, and the Guide rushed to help him. "Follow me, little one. There's something that I'd like to show you."\n\nThey walked for a while until they came to a grove. A strange, deer-like creature sat surrounded by a myriad of beings, great and small. "Is that-" she began.\n\n"The Great Seedling? Yes, she's a good friend of mine. The ponies believe that she's a sign of a good harvest, but I see something more. With her, I see the world, a world where all are allowed to be. There is no one pure, no one impure, no mistakes. There are people." The Buffalo gave the Guide a hard stare. "Do you understand?""

hippone_jrnl_eq.15.desc: "Inside of the Hayseed Swamp was a small village hidden away in a bayou. Though it scarcely received visitors, today an entourage of Equines of Silver accompanied a thestral and an Equine of Gold as they passed by the village.\n\n"The bufogren you seek lives nearby," said Starry Glory as the Guide examined the quaint houses built upon the swamp. "It is a large creature with a stench so foul that it can knock out a pony if it gets too close. However, its ears are quite sensitive, so most thestrals simply scream at it until it goes away."\n\nThe Guide eyed him, chuckling, "Screaming? Really?" Starry nodded, his expression completely serious. The Guide brought a hoof to her face as she considered a possibility. "If its ears are that sensitive, I might have something that could incapacitate it..."\n\nThe group continued walking for some time, avoiding dirtying their hooves in the swamp when possible. Eventually, they began to hear some gurgling noises behind a sizable boulder in front of them. The Guide rose a hoof to halt her companions, then spoke in a hushed, but commanding voice. "When I give the signal, close your eyes and cover your ears. After five seconds, open them and charge the creature."\n\nShe reached into her pouch and pulled out a pair of potions and an empty vial. As she slowly walked around the boulder, she spotted it. A giant, many-eyed creature that seemed to be preoccupied with eating moss from a tree. The Guide carefully and quickly poured both potions into the empty vial, which began to sizzle. She then tossed it at the Bufogren and shouted, "NOW!"\n\nThe concoction smashed against the bufogren, causing the chemicals within to splatter all across it. The sizzling turned into popping, and then after a moment began a cacophony of blinding flashes and deafening bangs. The bufogren brought its webbed feet to its ears to try and halt the offense, but the painful noise was simply too much for it to bear. It toppled over, then was soon assaulted by the Equines of Silver and their deadly weapons.\n\nWhen the deed was done, Starry Glory came up to the Guide and asked, "What was that? I've never seen or heard anything like what you just did."\n\nShe smiled as she retrieved an eye from the bufogren. "An experiment, honestly. Though it was quite effective, wouldn't you agree?""

hippone_jrnl_gr.1.desc: ""We have arrived."\n\nThe Guide opened her eyes. It was time to begin the journey into the heart of Za'al-Maar's creations: The continent of Griffonia. She glanced at the Equine of Silver who had awoken her. Zethro was relatively short and softspoken, but he had proven himself more than capable on multiple occasions during the rise of the Ascendancy. The real reason that she had brought him, however, was that he had spent several years of his life traveling all around Griffonia before settling down in Hippone.\n\nWithout another word, the two zebras ascended to the boat's deck and took in the scenery of Seguro, a flourishing city on the coast of [413.owner.GetNameDef]. Ships were docking and departing all around them while large crowds of different creatures mingled with one another.\n\n"It's quite different from back home," mused Zethro before turning to face the Guide, "I'm not proud of my history here, but I hope that my knowledge of Griffonia will be of use to you."\n\n"Yes..." The Guide didn't meet his gaze, having noticed something that was setting off alarms in her head. Though the stain of the avian was not overwhelming here, she could spot a few griffons throughout the port. What had really grabbed her attention was a blasphemous sight: a griffon and a zebra were embracing one another, then closed their faces together as if they were...\n\n"I will be right back." Before Zethro could ask what she was doing, the Guide had already entered the midst of the crowd."

The two seemed to notice her as she got closer, though that did not slow her advance.\n\nThe griffon initially wore an expression of worry, then it turned into concern as he addressed the stranger storming towards him. "Are you all right? Can we help-" His words were cut off by a swift movement that saw a dagger now protruding from his throat. He gurgled and weakly reached for the blade, then collapsed. The zebra beside him gasped, not able to speak from the shocking event she just witnessed.\n\nThe Guide pressed the blade down to ensure the griffon's death. "Such filth has no place in this world. Oh ye who have poisoned the equine, I grant thee the fate you deserve." She retrieved the blade and turned towards the dead griffon's lover, "And you shall join him for rejecting your equinity!"\n\nThe other zebra screamed briefly before her life too came to an end. The crowd began to panic as they saw the murders. The Guide stood motionless, enjoying the righteous feeling of slaying the unclean. Just as some security had begun to take notice, Zethro arrived to usher the Guide away. "There will be time for killing avians later, we can't afford to cause scenes like this! We have to go!"\n\nThe Guide whipped her knife towards Zethro in anger, preparing to scold him for suggesting that she should have spared the griffon. However, she spotted what looked like the local authorities heading towards the two of them and thought better of it. She quickly put her knife away and nodded. "Very well. Let us make haste.""

hippone_jrnl_gr.2.desc: "The journey took the two zebras north through the mountains of Barrad. Though the harsh and sudden climate shifts were loathsome at best and hazardous at worse, their tenacity and willpower saw them through. After all, Zethro had assured the Guide that her first destination was worth any sacrifice to see at least once.\n\nAnd see it they did. Inside the land of Pònaidhean at the bottom of a narrow valley was a breathtaking sight: the city of Dail Mhòr, which was a radical departure from anything that the Guide had seen up to this point. Gone was all semblance of modern civilization, instead replaced largely by vast, extravagant monasteries and temples that stretched into the valley as far as the eye could see.\n\nZethro broke the awe-stricken silence. "The monks of this land are practiced in all sorts of arts, both physical and mystical. They live in harmony with each other and the wildlife, including the miniscule Breezies." He paused, seeming to hesitate, "That is why we're here, right? The Breezies?"\n\nAs the Guide opened her mouth to answer, she noticed a small group of floating critters not too far away. She smiled, "That's correct. Would those happen to be Breezies over there?"\n\nZethro squinted his eyes, then nodded, "Yes, though I would recommend caution. They can be troublesome if provoked."\n\n"Then I'll be quick." The Guide started off towards the Breezies, taking care to tread lightly so as to not draw too much attention to herself. She drew her knife, intending to quickly perform the deed, when... wait...\n\nShe had gotten close enough that she could see the Breezies clearly. Truthfully, she had never seen one before, but she knew that the Teacher required the wings of the creatures in front of her. What gave her pause was how... equine-like they were. These couldn't have been Cosmic Mistakes, they bore the shape of tiny, floating ponies.\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation, the Guide readied her knife, took a deep breath, and steeled herself."

He sat down next to a tree, making himself comfortable.\n\n"Perhaps after this is done, I could introduce you to him as thanks for your help so far."\n\n"I... that would be an honor."\n\nThe two had settled down next to a river north of the city of Ivanhorn. The territories of Wittenland were a treat to wander through, with many a talented pony showing the two travelers the wonders of Wittenlandic traditions. The best part was the local food, which was simply heavenly.\n\nHowever, their mission remained.

They'd have to find the next ingredient without Westerly's help.\n\nThe next few days were spent wandering around chasing rumors of where the mythical phoenix might live. So rare were the creatures that there were naught more than a few dozen confirmed sightings of them in recorded history... at least in the wild.\n\nAfter the fourth day of searching, exhaustion began to set in for Zethro, causing him to trip. "Maybe... maybe we'd be better off trying to find one in a- *cough* -a zoo somewhere?"\n\nThe Guide stopped to help Zethro get back on his hooves, "The phoenix is here, I know it. We have to keep searching." After patting him on the back, Zethro weakly nodded and continued searching with her.\n\nAfter a few more hours of fruitless searching, Zethro collapsed from heat exhaustion. The Guide rushed to his aid, cursing herself for pushing him too hard. She retrieved some water and carefully poured it down his throat, when suddenly...\n\nA bright, orange-red feather slowly fell in front of her, gently landing on top of Zethro's chest. As soon as it touched him, she felt a chilling warmth flow through him. Zethro's eyes shot open and he stood up as if he was perfectly healthy. "Woah!" he shouted, "What was that?! I feel amazing!"\n\nThe Guide sat speechless. She picked up the feather, then looked to the sky in hopes of finding where it came from. She caught a glimpse of something crimson flying behind the mountainside."
hippone_jrnl_misc_gr.2.desc_2: "To the zebras' mild disappointment, Westerly Leeward was not with the heavily armed squad. Said squad had explained that Westerly was preoccupied with happenings back in Jezeragrad and was unable to leave, so he sent one of his trusted spec-ops teams to assist "his favorite foreigner's student" with whatever she needed.\n\nAfter getting introductions and the mission briefing out of the way, the squad of eight ponies accompanied the Guide and Zethro to a rumored nesting location of the mythical phoenix. So rare were the creatures that there were naught more than a few dozen confirmed sightings of them in recorded history... at least in the wild.\n\nSoon enough, they arrived at a promising area. They settled into various hidden vantage points and began to wait, hoping that their intel was correct.\n\nAs the hours passed, some of them began to make hushed small talk with one another. One of the armed ponies turned to the Guide and whispered, "What do you need a phoenix feather for anyways?"\n\n"It is for the Teacher. He is working on a grand project, and I am gathering its vital components."\n\nThe pony turned his head, curious. "What sort of project?"\n\nThe Guide considered explaining the basics of the Ascendancy to the pony, but opted not to on account of how many other questions it would lead to. "Even I don't know what it is. But I trust him to right the wrongs in this world."\n\nBANG!\n\nA gunshot echoed throughout the mountains. The Guide saw a crimson-orange being plummet from the sky, feathers scattering everywhere. Just before it hit the ground, it ignited into flames. With a glorious screech, the phoenix stretched its wings out of the fire and corrected its fall, rising to fly once more into the sky."

They were greeted by a lone stallion who, despite the ghastly scars across his body, maintained a cheerful demeanor towards his visitors.\n\nAfter being given the keys to their rooms, the two began to head upstairs. However, Zethro paused to take another look around the place. The longer he looked, the more perplexed he became. "This architecture... it's not Wittenlandic."\n\nThe innkeeper coughed and chuckled, placing his hoof on an old desk, "You've got a sharp eye. I modeled this inn after my old house in Visaginas." The Guide stopped walking up the stairs, suddenly interested in listening to their conversation.\n\nZethro's eyes lit up. "The Vartai region! They always had such an interesting culture there..." His lighthearted expression vanished as he remembered one crucial detail, "But the Griffons ruined it, like they do to everything."\n\n"Yes, though..." The innkeeper's breathing became slightly ragged, "There are a few good ones."\n\n"Impossible." The Guide cut in, "The avian knows only deceit and desires only to serve their own."\n\nThe innkeeper's coughing subsided, though he leaned onto the desk for support. He took a long look at the Guide, seeming to consider how hostile her reaction had been to his comment. "You both seem to have come a long way, would you be interested in hearing a tale about what the griffons did to this old, tired stallion?" Zethro looked to the Guide, who gave a terse nod. The innkeeper smiled, "Then let me tell you a story...""

It was peaceful; everypony was friends with everygriff and everygriff helped out everypony. That changed when a griffon named Pallas Dusktalon took control of Longsword. He and the 'Reformisten' he served began to implement several harsh policies towards ponies. It came to be known as the Longswordian Genocide, as Dusktalon sought nothing less than the total extermination of ponykind.\n\n"My family and I, along with hundreds of other ponies were brought to a concentration camp. The Reformisten told us that we were going to be deported, but everypony knew why we were really there: They were going to execute us. All of us. And we would have been killed too, had it not been for-"\n\n"Za'al-Maar's demons have hurt you." The Guide gritted her teeth in righteous anger, "Know that we will return the pain they have inflicted-"\n\nThe innkeeper slammed his hoof onto the table. "Quiet young mare! Have you no manners? I'm telling a story!" He paused, waiting for the Guide to respond. She stared daggers at him, but said nothing. "As I was saying, we would have all been shot, but then a miracle happened: one of the Reformisten officers conspired to save us. No, don't open your mouths until I am done!\n\n"Her name was Raga Andris. She was rather not much older than you, young mare, and she was a very promising soldier in the Reformisten. Raga was well on her way to becoming a general when she was assigned to carry out the latest batch of executions. She oversaw our camp, and when the time came to line us up against the wall, she stopped. For a solid minute, we waited there, wondering what our fate would be. She stared directly at me and my family, who by the grace of Varėnė had kept us together to this point. Raga then suddenly ordered the other Reformisten griffons to leave, claiming that she wanted to do the deed herself.""

Years later I tried to contact her, but I learned that she had been tried for treason and shot the day after she freed us." The innkeeper opened the desk and retrieved a photograph, offering it to Zethro and the Guide. The Guide examined the photo. It depicted a young griffon and pony hugging one another. "I also found out that she used to be a close friend of my late son before she joined the Reformisten. Even though she made many terrible choices in life, in the end she chose to be a hero."\n\nThe Guide stared at the photo. This didn't make any sense. The creatures of Za'al-Maar weren't like this. It wasn't possible for them to be so selfless. There had to be something else, another factor. The stallion must have been lying...but he wasn't, she could tell. Her hooves shook. The story and photo were a maddening contradiction to everything she believed in. There wasn't-\n\n"You can keep the photo."\n\nThe Guide froze. Her eyes darted to the innkeeper, who simply smiled at her. Zethro sensed the tense atmosphere and quietly excused himself to go to sleep. After he hurried up the stairs, the innkeeper continued, "You have a lot of pain in your life. You look like the type that hides that pain by pretending to be powerful, by hurting those who disagree with you, but let me tell you: Real power is when you have every justification to kill, and you don't." The Guide was silent. "But hey, I'm just a tired, old stallion who talks too much. You have a good night, okay?""

He wondered about his own past, and considered the possibility that... no, he didn't want to think about it. Best to focus on the task at hoof.\n\nThe chirping of birds and the wildlife were eerily absent as they entered the Eygsic Forest. The gigantic winding trees curved into one another, forming an ominous covering that let only tiny amounts of light through. They were forced to use lanterns to see where they were going. Zethro found that he was having trouble keeping up with the Guide. Just before she left his field of view, he called out to her. "Wait! Don't you know what's in here?"\n\nThe Guide halted in her stride, then broke her long silence, "The next ingredient. It's ahead, I can feel it."\n\n"That's precisely why we need to be careful! The Eygsic Spiders are terrifyingly fierce, and you're going after the silk of one of their Queens! I don't think becoming lunch for them is going to help the Star Father!"\n\nShe stared at him with a determined look on her face. "They won't bother me. If you keep up, they won't bother you either."\n\n"How do you know that?!" said Zethro as he rapidly looked around, his fear of spiders setting in. Instead of answering, The Guide headed deeper into the forest. Zethro struggled after her, trying desperately not to lose sight of the Guide. Not too long after, he noticed that the trees they were passing had silk on them. He made the mistake of looking up, only to see dozens, perhaps hundreds of giant spiders crawling around on webs and tree branches above them. Though he was petrified to the bone, he didn't dare stop moving.\n\nThe Guide briefly paused at a small clearing, where a grand web was spun in front of her. It was taller than any building she'd ever seen, and in the center of it laid a behemoth of a spider surrounded by countless eggs. It sat perfectly still, watching her every move. The Guide approached a small section of the silky web and quickly cut off a part of it, then turned to leave as calmly as she entered."
hippone_jrnl_gr.4.desc_2: "Westerly's spec-ops team was waiting for them when they left the inn.

The spec-ops team swiveled their weapons towards it, though they did not fire. The Guide leaned towards Zethro and whispered into his ear, "When I give the signal, follow me."\n\nZethro didn't know what the signal was meant to be, but he nodded anyways. After the forest became silent once more, the group continued onwards. Zethro made the mistake of looking up, only to see dozens, perhaps hundreds of gigantic spiders crawling around on webs and tree branches above them. The Guide yanked his head down and quietly told him to remember what she said.\n\nThe group stopped at a small clearing, where a grand web was spun in front of them. It was taller than any building the Guide had ever seen, and in the center of it laid a behemoth of a spider surrounded by countless eggs. It sat perfectly still, watching their every move.\n\nSuddenly, a gunshot rang out as one of the spec-ops members fired at a nearby spider that got too close for their liking. What followed was utter horror as numberless spiders began to descend upon the team. The Guide pulled Zethro away and began to run towards the Spider Queen's web. The spec-ops team unloaded their weapons into horde of spiders, but with every one they felled, dozens more appeared from the darkness.\n\nBy the time the Guide reached the bottom of the web, the gunfire had stopped. With a terrified Zethro in tow, she quickly cut off a piece of the silky web and turned to leave, making sure to move slowly and calmly through the masses of spiders."

And the Guidance had never failed her.\n\n"I just don't understand, how is that you are so certain that we need something not on the list? And why would it be here? There's nothing but shoreline and rocks. And crabs. I hate crabs."\n\nShe hushed Zethro, "Quiet. We need to be patient. I just... have a feeling. It's hard to explain."\n\nZethro briefly opened his mouth to protest, but said nothing. They continued to wait for some time. Eventually, the angle of the sun began to shine in Zethro's eyes, which caused him to shift around for a less-blinding position. The Guide hissed at him again and told him to be still, no matter what.\n\nNot a few moments later, they began to hear the flapping of wings from behind them. The Guide and Zethro ever so slightly turned their heads to see part of an absolutely gargantuan bird land on top of the outcropping that they had only partially ascended. Still, the two sat quietly, making no noise and no sudden movements.\n\nAs time passed and the sun set, the bird seemed to fall asleep. The Guide procured a small vial from her pouch and lightly kicked Zethro. "We need one of its feathers. I'll pluck one, you hold this chemical up to its beak. It should put the creature to sleep if it wakes up."\n\nHaving been saved by the Guide on multiple occasions now, Zethro knew better than to question her. The two zebras quietly climbed up the rest of the outcropping to get to the giant bird. Upon reaching the top, they saw the creature for what it was: a roc. The Guide made her way to the roc's tail while Zethro crawled up to its beak. The fact that the beak was almost as large as him didn't do his nerves any favours.\n\nThe two looked at one another and nodded. Zethro held the vial up and silently prayed while the Guide plucked a feather from its tail. The roc's eyes shot open briefly, freezing Zethro in fear, but then they slowly closed again. The two slowly backed away, making off with another ingredient for the Star Father's superproject."

It was a beautiful day, with sparse clouds slowly moving across the vast expanse above them. She sighed and lowered her head, but did not turn to face Zethro. "You are an Equine of Silver, you know better than to talk to me like that."\n\n"I... Fine. I'm just worried, you're not usually like this."\n\nThe Guide turned to face her companion. "What do you think of the avian, Zethro?"\n\nDespite her neutral expression, her eyes seemed to pierce deep into him. Zethro wondered if this was a test, but something seemed off... "The avian is a creature spawned of Za'al-Maar who seeks to corrupt and destroy the equine-"\n\nShe shook her head. "No, I'm not asking what the Ascendancy thinks of the avian. I'm asking what YOU think of the avian."\n\nZethro paused. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. "I used to have a griffon friend when I was younger. He was the only griffon that I actually got along with. We even traveled across Griffonia together. He was always good to me, but we ended up parting ways when we both decided to settle down. I went to Zebrica, he stayed here. Despite my attempts, I never could find peace with myself. One day, I heard the teachings of the Star Father and knew that was my purpose in life. To help destroy the avian. I have followed the path I've been asked to walk, but sometimes... I wonder if there are avians that have escaped the influence of Za'al-Maar. Avians that are... good."\n\n"You know that such a thought is heresy in the eyes of the Ascendancy."\n\nHe stood silently for a moment. "I do."\n\nThe wind began to pick up, blowing leaves between the two. The Guide turned away. "We have to make another stop to the northeast, near the Nimbusian Coastline."\n\n"Wait, why? The next ingredient on the list is in the Hillpony lands to the west.""

The changeling either didn't notice their dissatisfaction or pretended not to, for she happily hummed a tune while preparing her trusted dinghy for the voyage ahead.\n\nWithout thinking, Zethro blurted out, "You seem awfully friendly compared to most changelings."\n\nThe Guide immediately scowled at his rude comment. Changelings were just as equine as Zebras; they deserved the same treatment.\n\nThe changeling didn't seem bothered at all. "Oh, I get that a lot! Don't worry, I'm not gonna 'suck you dry' or anything. This is just how I am. Though trade has been really rough ever since what happened back in Blosmport... Oh! Sorry! I tend to get caught up with the past. Anyways, you're both going to the port at Blackwater, right?"\n\n"Yes," answered the Guide. Then after a moment's thought, she added, "Actually, could you take us to the northern pony lands? Around the Dread Peninsula, to Everfrost? We could quickly pick up what we need there, then take your boat back. We'd cover any additional expenses, of course."\n\nThe changeling's smile disappeared as she shook her head. "Sorry, I maintain a strict no-go policy to the waters around there. The Dead Sea is filled to the brim with all sorts of nasties, and my ship isn't big enough to ignore them. The furthest I can go is Blackwater." Just as quickly as her smile had vanished, it was back again with even more splendor. "Don't worry though, it's really pretty this time of year!"\n\n"Blackwater it is, then."\n\nAs the ship set off, the Guide and Zethro looked over their map. They only had three places left to visit, but all of them were quite far away. Zethro scratched his muzzle, "The next item should be in the Hillpony lands. After that, we'll need to make a harrowing trek into the Whitetail Mountains, then to the frozen lands north of that.""

hippone_jrnl_misc_gr.6.desc: "It didn't take the Guide long to figure out that the "holy water" she needed wasn't in Blackwater or anywhere around it. The locals were both extremely helpful and vague when questioned about where she could find some. After connecting several explanations together, she and Zethro deduced that mystical liquid they seeked laid in the "water forests" to the west.\n\nThe journey there was uneventful, almost ominously so. It seemed like every hour the landscape transformed more and more from the usual tiaga into something truly alien. They began to have difficulty traversing the almost dreamlike maze of ancient trees, streams, and rivers that broke apart into tiny, narrow waterways. Giant mushrooms appeared from every new corner that weaved into the seemingly endless forest canopy. Chirps and other noises from typical woodland critters were replaced by unfamilar crackles and hisses.\n\nWith some difficulty they managed to locate the source of the streams: a tranquil spring from which the water flowed out of with nothing flowing in to replenish it. "This is it," said the Guide as she pulled out a flask from her pouch. She reached down and scooped some of the crystal clear, but otherwise mundane-looking water into the flask and sealed it shut.\n\nZethro sighed in relief. "That was... surprisingly easy. Hopefully the next few will also be free of proble-"\n\n"You are not welcome here."\n\nThe Guide and Zethro whipped themselves around towards the sudden, somber voice. The Guide instinctively readied her knife, as she knew that anyone who could actually sneak up on her usually didn't have good intentions.\n\nThe hooded mare behind them remained composed despite the intruders' hostile stance. She turned her head, glancing towards the path that the zebras had entered from. "You have defiled God's holy place. Your intentions are impure, though we cannot stop you without enough bloodshed that our victory would be pyrrhic. Leave before you pollute our home any further."\n\nThe Guide and Zethro briefly looked at each other. Zethro shrugged, then the Guide turned to the mare and bowed in an attempt to apologize. "We apologize for the intrusion. We will depart at once.""

hippone_jrnl_gr.7.desc: "The treacherous peaks of Whitetail did not earn their name for nothing. Every day was met with challenging terrain, remnants of bandits, and dangerous creatures that threatened their expedition. Fortunately, none of these proved too difficult to overcome.\n\nJust as they had finished killing another avian that had tried to rob them, Zethro began to come down with an illness. The Guide helped him to a nearby cave where they took shelter for the remainder of the day while she administered potions to him. Despite her expert knowledge of medicine, he did not seem to recover. She scowled, surmising that he must have caught something not covered by her repertoire of elixirs.\n\nSuddenly, she heard a menacing growl pierce the muted howl of the mountain's wind. She turned to the cavern's entrance to see a fearsome, winged boar slowly advancing towards her. She glanced back to Zethro, whose fever had made him unresponsive. What luck she had, finding exactly what she needed at the worst possible time.\n\nThe Guide readied her knife and surprised the boar by charging towards it. The boar charged back, but it did not expect her to jump over it while angling the knife to cut its head and back open as she passed through the air. The boar collapsed to the ground, and the Guide returned to finish it off. With practiced finesse, she severed the tusk of the boar and placed it into her pouch before returning to Zethro.\n\nShe spent the rest of the day trying to heal him to no avail. His illness seemed to only get worse, though he did have brief moments of consciousness here and there. During one such moment, he asked her to get a "medical Equine of Gold", seeming to forget exactly where he was, but he soon passed out again just as quickly.\n\nThe Guide weighed her options. She could go back to the ponies of that odd village... no, they probably wouldn't help her considering how they had reacted to the two of them. She could continue on the journey and hope that the northern ponies had a remedy. Or... she could go with the unthinkable option: the avians in Whitetail were both close by and might have experience with this illness themselves. She looked at her shaking hooves as she saw her friend struggling to cling to life in front of her."

hippone_jrnl_gr.8.desc: "As their journey continued into the arctic north, Zethro's situation grew more and more dire. The plethora of potions that the Guide had been giving him only seemed to keep him moderately stable. The tips of his hooves began to turn purple, though whether that was from the disease or from frostbite, she wasn't sure. She didn't have time to check, especially since the calm tundra had given way to a fearsome blizzard. She even had to down the last of her heating potions just to warm herself enough to keep going.\n\nShe paused to check her compass, only to find that it wasn't there. She turned around hoping to find it in the snow nearby, but the blizzard was too fierce; she could barely see the ends of her hooves as it was. She whipped her heard around, looking for something, anything to use as a landmark, but there was only a pure white void in every direction.\n\nAs loathe as she was to use the Guidance this way, she needed help here. The Guide closed her eyes and focused. She felt drawn to an odd direction, and so she followed the will of the ever-present Guidance. When she opened her eyes again, she found herself at the mouth of a modest cavern. Not particularly deep, but it offered some shelter from the elements. She entered it and carefully set Zethro down, then threw her cloak over him to keep him warm.\n\nZethro began to cough again. The Guide unloaded her bags and took stock of her medical supplies, only to be faced with the grim reality of her situation: she did not have the means to save him. Not without help. Not without...\n\nA realization clicked in her mind. The final ingredient she had yet to find. The "Hammer of the Thunder Bear" was a legendary artifact said to instill strength and the will to survive into whoever held it. If she could find it, then it just might be able to save him long enough for her to get more medical supplies.\n\nShe quickly turned leave the cavern, but then a weak voice halted her hooves. "M-mom?" The Guide turned around. Zethro was immobile, his eyes closed. His breathing was ragged, and it would seem that he had become delirious as well. "It's s-so d-dark... please d-don't go..."\n\nShe cursed it all. She cursed Za'al-Maar, she cursed his creations, she cursed this forsaken continent and every hardship they had endured for the Teacher. She cursed this maddening illness that she could not cure, and she cursed herself for not bringing a wider variety of potions.\n\nThe Guide stared at her dying friend. The chances of the final ingredient being able to save him were slim, but it might just be worth pursuing... though she feared that she might not return in time to save him. If she was to leave, then she needed to decide now."

Through the blistering chill and scalding snow she ran with such determination that nothing short of divine intervention would stop her. She wouldn't lose another friend. Not again.\n\nFor how long she ran, she didn't know. The Guidance prodded her to turn left and head up a small hill. It wasn't that far now, she could feel it. At the crest of hill, she squinted her eyes and looked all around her. Through the blizzard she spotted something, a series of dirtied tombstones partially hidden in the snow. She made her way to them, only to find that she could not read the odd language hacked onto them.\n\nMany of the gravestones had suffered from severe wear and tear, but the Guide could tell that love and care had been put into almost all of them, for no two shared a design. Unfortunately she did not know which one held the Hammer. The Guidance's aid had ended here, she was on her own.\n\nThe Guide considered picking graves at random to dig up, but dismissed the idea as she would likely freeze to death before she found the Hammer. None of the gravestones seemed to suggest that any particular grave held the mythical item she sought. She grit her teeth, the cold was starting to numb her extremities. Just as she had resigned herself to starting with the fanciest looking grave, she noticed something: All of the gravestones had a pony etched on them... except for one. The last was a small, otherwise unremarkable stone marker that had a bear-shaped form on it.\n\nShe immediately began to dig. If this "Thunder Bear" was buried here, then the Hammer must be with them. By the time she had removed enough snow to access the grave, her hooves had begun to feel like they were burning. Not a good sign, she grimaced. With significant effort, she managed to heft open the coffin. Inside was a frozen pony skeleton with what looked like the pelt of a polar bear on it. Bear claws were strewn about a necklace around its neck, and in its hooves was a dull, withered-looking hammer.\n\nThe Guide reached down and grasped the hammer. As the legends said, she was suddenly filled with the strength to persevere. She briefly allowed herself to smile, then remembered why she had hurried so much to get here. With renewed vigor, she turned around and ran back towards the cave she had left Zethro in."

Her eyes darted in all directions as she struggled to search. Most equines would have long since frozen to death, but sheer force of will kept her going.\n\nAdding to her frustrations, the Guidance was silent again. She had considered trying to force it to help her, though she had a sinking feeling that doing so would only make her situation worse. She resigned herself to simply keep looking.\n\nAfter some time, she spotted a rock formation jutting out of the snow through the corner of her eye. She sprinted towards it, praying that it belonged to the cave she'd left Zethro in. When she got to it, her heart surged with hope as she recognized the cavern entrance.\n\nShe froze when she saw an additional set of hoofprints leaving the cave. Panic began to set in. She looked inside, but Zethro wasn't there. The Guide sprinted back outside. She began to follow the other set of hoofprints. They appeared to be heavy tracks in the snow, suggesting that someone had dragged their hooves through it. She followed the tracks with a sinking feeling in her gut. "Please be alive, please be alive..."\n\nHer heart skipped a beat when she stepped on something that was most certainly not the ground. She looked down to see an unmoving Zethro who was partially obscured by the snow. The Guide tore the snow away to get to get to him. Fear washed over her as she realized he wasn't breathing.\n\nShe grabbed his hoof and shoved the hammer onto it, but nothing happened. "No! You can't die now!" she sobbed. She kept pushing the hammer into his hoof and praying for a miracle that wouldn't come. "Please... please... not like this..." Tears streamed down her face, some freezing to her cheeks. This wasn't how it was meant to be. Wasn't how it was meant to happen...\n\nShe remembered how scared he had sounded when he asked her not to leave. Did he know that he was about to die? Was he so afraid of dying alone that he tried to follow her? It didn't matter now. She had failed him. She let one of the few equines that she had actually grown to trust die.

The way he carried himself, it almost seemed like he was... more than just Hiram. More than the Teacher she knew. The lab had changed too, it now seemed much more organized and less hazardous than before. There was even a small resting area with some drinks on a nearby table. Hiram stopped in front of said table and picked up a cup of hot cocoa, then offered it to the Guide. "I take it that your expeditions were successful?"\n\n"Yes, of course. I got everything you had asked for." The Guide joined him at the resting area and accepted the drink. As she sat down, the memories of all of the hardships she had endured to get the Star Father's ingredients resurfaced. She sipped at the drink. Elishat and Zethro would have loved to be here.

The Guidance had been awfully quiet lately as well. She decided to just watch the trainees for now. It wasn't like she was in a rush.\n\nWith finesse, the Equines of Silver struck dummy targets with dulled blades and bayonets, while others practiced firing at targets from various distances. Occasionally, one would make a mistake and be punished with additional work or training. In rare cases, some who hesitated to accept the role of an Equine of Silver would be forced to duel with sticks against other trainees who held real blades. But today, the Guide saw something that surprised her: One equine, a young pegasus mare, threw down her rifle and refused to continue her training. An Equine of Gold stepped in and lambasted her for her foolishness. She spat in the Equine of Gold's face, who then struck her and accused her of being a Crypto-Avian.\n\nAs the pegasus was restrained and dragged away, the Guide suddenly felt a resurgence within her: the Guidance was pulling her towards that mare.

"I shall grant her the opportunity to absolve her sins under my careful watch."\n\nOne of the escorts hesitated while the other immediately let go of the pegasus.

See how far you get before this is buried into you, heretic. Need I remind you that I did not have to save you back there."\n\nThe Guide could see fear in the pegasus' eyes for a moment. Said pegasus quickly recovered her composure, then brazenly pushed the Guide's blade away. "Whatever. It's not like I have anywhere to go, especially since you lunatics murdered my host family and seized the ports."\n\n"Their spirits were likely corrupted by Za'al-Maar. Fortunately, they will be reincarnated into proper Equines of Bronze and Iron. Or Equines of Silver if they are lucky."\n\nThe pegasus scoffed, "Oh, shut up. I was mindin' my own business in Colthage when your purple freaks showed up and shot everypon- everycreature who refused to join your little circus."\n\nThe Guide paused for a moment. She recognized her accent. "...You are from Equus, aren't you? What's your name?"\n\n"Manehattan, born and raised." She said matter of factly, "Growing up I always wanted to visit Colthage, so I decided to study abroad once the big conflict with the Coltvans and the Constitutionalists boiled over. Guess I didn't think that the country would implode a third time. And I'll tell you my name if you tell me yours."\n\nThe Guide allowed herself a smirk. "I am known as the Guide."\n\nThe pegasus rolled her eyes. "Really? You know what, fine. I'll play your game. You can call me 'Unlucky College Student.'"\n\nDespite her desire to end this miserable brat's life here and now, she knew that the Guidance had drawn her to this pegasus for a reason. Who knows, perhaps she could help this young mare accept her role as an Equine of Silver."

hippone_jrnl_misc_zeb.11.desc: "The next few days were spent traveling across the plains of northern Zarantia. Over time, the vegetation and wildlife grew more sparse, and eventually the vast desert that Zarantia was known for were all that appeared before the Guide and the Student.\n\nBetween taking sips of water from her canteen, the Student asked, "So what's this 'Tattle-worm' look like again?"\n\n"It is pronounced 'Tatzlwurm.' From what I know, it is a fearsome creature that lives under the sands of Zarantia. Much like its name suggests, it resembles a giant worm, though it has tentacles reaching out of its mouth that it uses to grab prey with."\n\n"I don't like the sound of that at all." The Student waited for the Guide to answer, but was met with silence. "So... how exactly are you going to kill one?"\n\nThe Guide paused to retrieve a pair of flasks of glowing liquids from her pouch. Showing them to the Student, she said, "These substances, when mixed together, act as an extremely deadly and fast-acting poison. You are going to aggravate one and toss the flasks into its mouth as it chases you. With any luck, the Tatzlwurm will die before it grows bored and retreats underground."\n\nThe Student nodded in understanding, then a realization dawned on her, "Wait, you want ME to be bait for this thing? Nuh-uh. No way. Not in a million years."\n\nChuckling, the Guide put away the flasks. "Oh, but you will. Consider this your first test to redeem yourself in the eyes of the Ascendancy, my Student."\n\nThe Student scoffed again, "I already told you I don't want to go back to your stupid fraternity club. You want me to potentially get eaten by this thing? Make me."\n\n"Do you really think that's just water you're drinking?" The Guide smirked as the Student suddenly stopped being uncooperative, "I laced your canteen with an addictive potion that will kill you shortly after the withdrawal effects kick in. I have the cure, but you won't get it until we have a dead Tatzlwurm.""

Though her knowledge of the native "Imazeeb" culture of Zarantia was limited, she knew enough that they needed to stay away from the locals. If they found out that the Guide intended to kill one of their "sacred worms" then there would be tartarus to pay.\n\nThe night came and went, fortunately uneventful. The morning, however, heralded exactly what they needed: The Guide had awoken early to survey the surrounding area, and she spotted a small group of rugged zebras pulling a cart through the desert. The Guide quickly woke the Student and directed her attention to the zebras in the distance. "See those bandits? When they are eaten, we will make our move. Do you remember what to do?"\n\n"Y-Yeah." The Student gulped, trying not to sound nervous, "I do. Get the tattle-worm to follow me, and then toss the poison flasks into it. Keep it distracted until it keels over, and... Oh my Celestia, I'm really going to have to do this. You know, for being a 'Guide' you really are terrible at-"\n\n"Go now!" The Guide interrupted. She pushed the Student forward, who promptly yelped in surprise. "The Tatzlwurm will surface soon! If we lose it, we may not find another so easily!"\n\nThe Student grumbled, then took flight towards the bandits. True to the Guide's claim, the sand beneath the bandits and their cart began to ripple. The bandits began to panic as they realized what was happening. Before they could flee, the sand beneath them gave way to a mouth big enough to swallow all of them whole, with a gargantuan Tatzlwurm attached to it. Their screams were quickly cut short as they vanished into the interior of the Tatzlwurm.\n\nThe Student's heart raced. She swallowed her fear, then yelled at the Tatzlwurm to get its attention. To her utter terror, the creature seemed to move much, much faster out of the sand than she anticipated. It dove towards her with frightening speed. The Student screamed, then prayed that she could fly faster than the Tatzlwurm's head could move. She hurriedly tossed the flasks behind her as she fled. The flasks disappeared into the Tatzlwurm as its tentacles reached out for the Student, nearly grasping her.\n\nSuddenly, a violent explosion from behind rocked the Student and sent her careening towards the ground. She landed with a thud, but thankfully didn't break any bones. Moments later, she saw the Guide rushing over to the gory viscera that used to be a Tatzlwurm to claim the acid gland within it. The Student raised her voice at the Guide, "You said it was poison!""

They made some brief stops in various Imazeeb settlements to resupply, but didn't stay long as not to attract too much attention. The Guide held an organ from one of their holy creatures, after all. Onwards they went, with their next stop being somewhere in one of the most inhospitable places in the world: Azir.\n\nThe two of them walked for some time before the Student spoke up again. "You're wrong, you know. Harmony isn't a poison."\n\nThe Guide withdrew another pair of Chilling potions from her pouch and offered one to the Student. "You believe that because you lack faith."\n\n"I have plenty of faith," scowled the Student as she accepted the potion, "Faith in the Princesses. Faith in Harmony. Faith that good will always triumph over evil in the end. And believe me, your Ascendancy is the most evil, twisted faith I've ever heard of. It won't last forever."\n\n"That is where you are mistaken, my Student. The Equestrians and their Alicorns may be fragments of the Godhead, but that is all they are. Fragments, unrefined and unshaped. Once they have the opportunity to accept the blessed truth that the Ascendancy provides, they will gladly join us in our ultimate goal to restore the Godhead. Only then will we be immortal again."\n\n"You're insane. Your cult forces everypony to kneel and slaughters those that don't. That's not accepting any truth, that's just genocide."\n\nThe Guide briefly closed her eyes and took a deep breath to calm herself. "Sacrifices must be made for the greater good. In time you will accept this as well."\n\nThe Student considered arguing further, but deemed that venture an exercise in futility. "Whatever. Are we there yet?""

We will have to wait for this 'Unbound Magic' to become apparent, so we might as well make camp here."\n\nOver the next several hours, the two travelers sat patiently, waiting for something to happen. The Student first noticed that something was amiss when she felt her spine tingle. Out of the corner of her eyes, she kept spotting black rocks and broken pillars in the distance, but whenever she tried to focus her eyes on them, they vanished. She truly began to feel unsettled when the very air itself seemed to flicker in front of her. Somewhere deep in her mind, she knew that this place was not safe. Her senses were screaming at her to leave immediately, but she did not know why.\n\nIf the Guide was also being affected by this place, she didn't show it. The Guide stood up and walked up to one of the flickering anomalies, then opened a small vial in front of it. She whispered something, then a small part of the odd phenomenon seemed to be drawn into the vial. The Guide then sealed it and turned to the Student, beckoning her to follow, "We have what we came here for. Let's go."\n\n"Hold on. What the hay is wrong with this place and why does it give me the heebie-jeebies?"\n\n"Even I do not know," The Guide began to walk away, forcing the Student to follow after her, "The magic in this place terrifies any equine who sets hoof into it. The fear is deep-seated and no one understands why. Even the locals, as sparse as the tribes here are, avoid it at all costs."\n\nThe Student turned her head in confusion, "But nothing happened to us. What's there to be scared of?"\n\nThe Guide contemplated this question for a moment. "...I'm not sure I want to know, honestly. Would you rather we investigate it further?" She looked to the Student, who shook her head. "Then let us push this place out of our minds...""

Some even looked like they were prepared to flee at a moment's notice.\n\nEven the Guide seemed somewhat off-put by this. As she purchased some supplies from the market square, she inquired about the odd behavior of the ponies around her.\n\n"I'm surprised you don't know," said the salespony in a hushed tone, "The terror up north has consumed the media and the minds of everypony here."\n\n"What terror?" inquired the Guide with concerned curiosity.\n\nThe salespony shuddered briefly. "They call it the 'Ascendancy.' A truly frightening cult that has proclaimed death and destruction to all who oppose it. Any who resist their rule suffer a cruel and painful demise. Already many have fallen to them, and everypony here is wondering if we'll be next."\n\n"That's... that's ridiculous!" The Guide looked appalled, "The Star Father has promised us salvation, and only if we listen and adhere to his principles will we achieve transcendence. Those who don't are simply corrupted by Za'al-Maar."\n\nHorror seemed to overcome the salespony as he listened to her. "You... you're one of them! What are you, a scout for their army? Please, leave us be! Just go! We have nothing to offer you and everything to lose!" The salespony stumbled backwards, abandoning his stall and fleeing from the Guide.\n\nShe stood shocked, processing the salespony's extreme reaction. The Student then spoke up from behind her. "Now do you understand? What your 'Ascendancy' does to innocent ponies they've yet to conquer?"\n\nThe Guide shook her head, both to dismiss the Student's words and to clear her own thoughts.

For hours, they pilfered through coffins and various containers in search of said mythical tablet.\n\n"I still don't get why your Star Dad needs all these things," The Student complained as she hefted another rock off of an obstructed coffin, "Couldn't he have just bought some substitute ingredients from the grocery store?"\n\nThe Guide dusted off a vase to examine it for clues. "If it was that simple, we wouldn't be out here."\n\n"Fair enough," The Student lifted open the coffin, then sighed in disappointment when she saw that it was empty. She sat down as a thought crossed her mind, "One more thing: How do you always know exactly where to look? I haven't seen you use a map at all, at least not since we started."\n\n"It's... complicated." The Guide held up the vase, then smashed it onto the ground.

What if they have to die too? Will it still be worth it in the end?"\n\nThe Guide gritted her teeth, images of Elishat and Zethro flashing through her mind. "Yes." she said firmly.\n\nThe Student pressed further, determined to get a reaction out of the Guide. "And once you stand with an empty world broken by your hooves, what then? How many cultures have to be wiped out? Histories erased? Cities destroyed?

Reaching for her blade, the Guide contemplated whether or not ending the life of this insolent Student was worth defying the Guidance. After a moment, she composed herself and instead responded to the Student. "If we do not make these sacrifices, then our souls will be lost forever."\n\nThe Student screamed in exasperation. "WHY ARE YOU SO... SO... I DON'T EVEN HAVE WORDS!"\n\n"You're becoming hysterical." Before the Student could speak any further, the Guide turned and threw a small vial at her.

Eventually, the Guide's neck ached from being bent down so much that she paused to move it around to relieve the stress. It was then that she noticed that there was a small patch of land off to their left in the distance that wasn't flooded. Upon it were a few plants, though she couldn't tell what they were from here. She changed course to take a closer look, then found none other than the rare beanstalk she had been searching for.\n\nAfter collecting several coffee beans and storing them safely in her pouch, the Guide turned to instruct the Student on where they needed to go next.

HIE_CTH_a1_desc: "The age of strife has begun my brothers and sisters, the stars have aligned and the battle for the soul of equinity has begun. But the corrupting forces of the Avian are always at work, and will not let us ascend beyond this world so easily. So we must continue to fight until final victory is achieved."
HIE_CTH_a2: "An Indomitable Will"
HIE_CTH_a2_desc: "The enlightend are the vanguard of the new age, those who know the truth of the Avian scourge form the core of our efforts. Unfortunately, until we can uplift our fellow equines, we cannot fully trust them in our ranks. Our forces shall stay small and elite for now."
HIE_CTH_a3: "The Power Of The Equines Of Silver"
HIE_CTH_a3_desc: "The wise and powerful Equines of Silver are the warriors of our new society, they are learned students of the Star Father and know his words and universal law. It is their spiritual power that shall allow them our armies to purge the plagues that afflict our land."
HIE_CTH_a4: "Strike At The Heart Of Evil"
HIE_CTH_a4_desc: "How the mighty Colthage has fallen when entrusted to the heathen Zarishat, the Right Hoof of the Demiurge. Selfish and wicked, she let the Avians into our homes for her own power and wealth, abandoning the great spirit of equinity and becoming one with the will of Za'al-Maar. But her general, Monzano still remains, carrying on her corrupting work. She must be purged."
HIE_CTH_a5: "March Upon The Crypto-Avians"
HIE_CTH_a5_desc: "A new corruption is rising in Colthage. Criminals, mercenaries, and souls seduced by the lies of Za'al-Maar have banded together under a crypto-Avian named Benoam Gerza. Bent on enforcing soul theft upon all of the equines of colthage and preventing them from reaching ascension. His forces are spread out however, and if we act fast he may quickly fall."

HIE_CTH_a7: "The Bloody Trial Of The Cohorts"
HIE_CTH_a7_desc: "The Cohorts wish to begin their journey to the truths of this world, but they have even farther to go than the Aspirants. They must enlighten themselves, achieve wisdom in the face of Za'al-Maar's corruption, and shed the blood of the enemies of equinity."
HIE_CTH_a8: "Wage War Upon The Soul Thieves"
HIE_CTH_a8_desc: "Soul theft, the disgusting chains of the material world, keep us bound to this realm.

So while we still exist in this cursed plane, we must end this process of theft and seize all material for the Covenant war effort."
HIE_CTH_a9: "Exalt The Equines Of Bronze And Iron"
HIE_CTH_a9_desc: "Those who craft, making the best they can of this material world we are trapped in, are worthy of respect within the Ascendancy.

HIE_CTH_a10: "The Wisdom Of The Equines Of Gold"
HIE_CTH_a10_desc: "The Equines of Gold are the wisest among us, those who have knowledge of the ways of the spirit world, and who can see clearly through the lies of the servants of Za'al-Maar.

HIE_CTH_a11: "Uncover The Tools Of Resistance"
HIE_CTH_a11_desc: "Upon the fall of the Arch-Heathen's regime, her army shattered as soul thieves descended upon our land. Weapons, imported by the cartels, were scattered throughout the land like dust in the wind. We must find these chaches and turn them against the wicked souls who hold us down."
HIE_CTH_a12: "Nourish The Bearers Of The Future"
HIE_CTH_a12_desc: "The old are often too corrupted by the influence of the Avian to truly understand the Teacher's words. But the young, the young have not yet lived a life in a world controlled by the Avian. They can learn, they can grow into the subjects the Ascendancy needs."
HIE_CTH_a13: "Rebuild The Hearths And Homes"
HIE_CTH_a13_desc: "The home is the core unit of our new society. It acts as a sanctum where equines may live and practice their craft away from sinister forces. But the hearths have gone out in the war, we must rebuild for the good of our subjets."
HIE_CTH_a14: "Bring About The End Of Soul Theft"
HIE_CTH_a14_desc: "No more shall the souls of the equines be corrupted by the Avian! These economic systems of the modern age are nothing more than ways the Avians tie us to this realm.

HIE_CTH_a15: "The Gift Of Compassion And Benevolence"
HIE_CTH_a15_desc: "The wise patricians of the equines of gold have graciously opened their purses to assist in the rebuilding of colthage. The lower castes must be cared for in this time of crisis and in all their wisdom, we shall rise to the occasion."

HIE_CTH_a17_desc: "We must rid our domain of the scourges and crypto-avians that weakened the lands and resisted our mission. We must make it clear that our mission will not be impeded."
HIE_CTH_a18: "Behead The 'Lion' Of The West"
HIE_CTH_a18_desc: "With our final triumph in the war, we must now rid our lands of the bandit scourges. The 'Lion' of the West is a prime culprit of crypto-aviancy, pilfering from equine civilians for their own gain."
HIE_CTH_a19: "Bring The Fallen To The Light"
HIE_CTH_a19_desc: "We must ensure that the remaining holdouts of republican resistance are stamped out. Perhaps if we were to feign amnesty for their heinous crimes we could encourage them to surrender their leaders to us."

HIE_CTH_a24: "The Indomitable Aspirants Of Poetry"
HIE_CTH_a24_desc: "The aspirants of poetry have been reported not only as efficient soldiers but as completely systematic fighters, not caring for style or impact when killing the enemy and simply going for the quickest method. We must ensure that these warriors are recruited and deployed to the frontline as soon as possible."
HIE_CTH_a25: "The Invincible Aspirants Of Companionship"

HIE_CTH_a26: "A Light Shining In The Darkness"
HIE_CTH_a26_desc: "The war has allowed the crypto-avians to destroy equine homesteads and damage crucial infrastructure. We must ensure our cohorts assist in the rebuilding of equine villages and ensure their survival."

HIE_CTH_c2: "Food For Both Body And Soul"
HIE_CTH_c2_desc: "The work to restore the Godhead cannot be done on an empty stomach, and too many stomachs are empty in Colthage after the war against the crypto-avians. Through the work of the state and the Equines of Gold, we can labor to keep the population fed."
HIE_CTH_c3: "Nature Must Be Nourished"
HIE_CTH_c3_desc: "This mortal plane, the prison of all equines, was created from the magical power of the Godhead. So while it is our jail, we must still make use of the great bounties it offers us, through both natural beauty and economic potential."
HIE_CTH_c4: "The Meritocracy Of Virtue"
HIE_CTH_c4_desc: "All equines born into a caste shall remain within that caste for their entire lives, thus is the will of the Star Father.

HIE_CTH_c5: "The Agrarian Ideal"

HIE_CTH_c8_desc: "Across Colthage there are old production guilds who are willing to work within our new system. They have accepted the words of the Star Father into their souls, and are willing to create everything we need to exterminate the avians. With the help of a few Equine of Gold advisors, they shall serve us well."
HIE_CTH_c9: "The Castes Of Production"
HIE_CTH_c9_desc: "In order to maintain the economic output we need to destroy the avian menace, all production must be centralized and placed under the control of skilled Equines of Gold. There is no room for the old ways in the new Ascendancy. All aspects of society must be reshaped."

hippone_sekrit.1.t: "The Price Of War"
hippone_sekrit.1.d: "They stood atop a wooden stage, the design of which spoke more to function than form. An Equine of Gold stood before a podium, flanked by a team of Equine of Silver, all resplendent in the garb that denoted their lot in life. A scroll lay before him, upon which lay a proclamation passed down from the Star Father himself.\n\n"It has come to the attention of the Covenant," the Equine of Gold declared in a sonorous voice, "that deviant soul thieves have been working within the city of Zapsa, hoarding their great wealth to use against the good equines living within."\n\nFrightened murmurs broke out amongst the crowd as the masked legions of the Star Father marched a group of two dozen zebras into the center of the square. They were beaten bloody, but were easy to identify as prominent industrialists and their families who had made the city their home.\n\n"These creatures," the Equine of Gold spat, heedless of the clamoring that grew before him, "have attempted to subvert the purity of our kind by engaging in the decadent vice of capitalism. They have tried to pervert the will of the equine to that of the avian, and in so doing, let the promise of the Star Father fall to ruin."\n\nThe battered zebras were marched from the square into waiting trucks, which departed with a single word from the leading Equine of Silver.\n\n"Thus, the wealth of these creatures shall be turned against them and what they represent. Their treachery shall be used against their crypto-avian masters to the west, and we shall prove the purity of the Equine kind once and for all!""
hippone_sekrit.1.a: "Za'al-Maar must be fought in all its forms"

hippone_sekrit.2.t: "Body And Mind"
hippone_sekrit.2.d: ""Hear me, and rejoice oh spirits of equinity! You have the privilege of being saved by the great Star Father! While you may now experience suffering, soon, your souls will be pure. Accept these gifts from your Lord and Teacher." The mare paced slowly down the street of the ruined village, preaching to the masses of terrified and starving hiding within the alleyways. "By his wisdom, we equines of gold, silver, bronze, and iron are here to lift you up to the level of true equines."\n\nThe mare stopped as she came to what appeared to be the town center. Turning around, she stood up straight, the sun illuminating her suit jacket in the dusk glow, and began to speak again, "I am Jezalla Zaalatit. Equine of gold, and servant of the Star Father. I have come to offer relief to you all. As the chosen spirits, you all have a chance to refute the will of Za'al Maar. We offer you the chance to become what you are meant to be. You need only to submit to the teachings of the Master. The equines of silver shall distribute the food, approach them if you are ready to swear your lives to His teachings."\n\nAs she finished, zebras began limping out of the stores and houses that dotted the square. Each one was directed by an equine of silver to a group of equines of bronze and iron. They reported their craft, their family size, and their education. Those who may be warriors were taken on the spot to see if they were worthy of studying the arts of the Grandmasters. All others were sent to collect their charity."
hippone_sekrit.2.a: "Maybe the Star Father isn't so bad..."

hippone_sekrit.3.t: "A Safe Haven"
hippone_sekrit.3.d: ""Hear me, and rejoice oh spirits of equinity! You have the privilege of being saved by the great Star Father!" The mare walked at the head of a vast procession into the destroyed city of Zapsa. The city's modern architecture long since destroyed in the civil war. Hooves beat against the stone roads in a rhythmic pounding as the rows of zebras entered the city's limits, towards the large gathering.\n\n"You all have been brought here to witness something glorious, the equines of silver have brought you here to show you the teachings of the Star Father in action." Gesturing to the zebras gathered behind her, she declared, "These are the equines of bronze and iron, the craftszebras of the Ascendency. They shall be those good souls who will rebuild your city. And within a month's time, you will live in new homes. A city rebuilt in the image of pure equinity. Many of you shall join their ranks someday, and if you can become talented enough at your craft, you shall achieve enlightenment and ascend as a true spirit of equine perfection. But that is many years of practice away. For now, give thanks to the Star Father, for he is the one who has given you the chance to save your soul!"\n\nOn queue, the equines of iron and bronze began a round of thunderous applause to the speech, and the audience slowly followed. The preacher stepped away from the crowd as a masked equine of silver approached her, "You did well, Jezalla. I'll take it from here and ensure corruption is purged from the city."\n\nJezalla turned to him and nodded, "You best follow through on that Aspirant Zakob. You failed the Star Father once when you failed to kill that Avian agent. You shall not fail again." The aspirant gulped and nodded before turning to his soldiers, "Protect the equines of bronze and iron. Kill any corrupted who resist their work.""
hippone_sekrit.3.a: "At least we've got roofs over our head again."

hippone_sekrit.4.t: "A Field Of Temples and Souls"
hippone_sekrit.4.d: ""Hear me, and rejoice oh spirits of equinity! You have the privilege of being saved by the great Star Father!" Jezalla Zaalatit walked amongst a camp of tents and beds, preaching to the injured, sick, and dying. "While the avians have harmed your physical form, they can never damage your soul, that spirit that makes you an equine. A fragment of the Godhead from which we all came."\n\nStopping at the bed of one wounded zebra, Jezalla held her hoof as her leg was stitched together, her screams of pain only silenced when the nurse, and equine of bronze and iron, stuffed her mouth with a gag of willow bark and cotton. The nurse then turned to her and spoke with hushed concern, "Lady Zaalatit, this mare will not survive without alchemical treatment. But only a bit of wound-sealer would guarantee her life. Could you or one of your assistants fetch it?"\n\nJezalla scowled at the nurse, "Do not speak so casually to an equine of gold! You shall be forgiven for the care you show to your work, but do not make the same mistake twice. I shall fetch the treatment." Leaving at a canter, Jezalla approached the largest tent in the field and swept aside the entrance flap, revealing a mare in a lab coat with bright purple-dyed hair and stripes. Upon seeing her, Jezalla briefly kneeled before standing and addressing her, "I apologize, miss. I did not know you would be here. I hope I did not interrupt your work." The zebra turned around to her and handed her a bottle, "Not at all, Jezalla. I think you'll be needing this for that patient. Now run along. I have more work to do."\n\nJezalla took the bottle and began to trot back to the patient's bed, not bothering to question how the mare knew why she was there before she arrived. As she left, a hooded figure approached the tent. Entering the tent, the stallion walked up just behind the mare. Looking over, she smiled briefly and turned to face the stallion, "Ah, Grandmaster of Pleasure, have you come for some potions?" The stallion pulled back his shawl, revealing sunglasses and a gauze mask, "Unfortunately not. While I love using your concoctions for my experiments, I am here to give you a summons to Hippone. The Star Father wishes to meet with the Guide once again."\n\nThe mare straightened her back and paused for a second before responding, "Then tell him I'll be there as soon as I can. I must always answer my teacher's call."\n\nThe Grandmaster nodded and went to leave, before turning back. "Oh, bring your alchemical supplies. He has uses for them.""
hippone_sekrit.4.a: "The Guide and the Teacher together."

hippone_sekrit.5.t: "The Auspicious Government"
hippone_sekrit.5.d: "The host of the Equines of Gold stood before him at rapt attention. Before him lay a message from the Star Father himself, a sanctified missive that had been penned by his holy hoof. He was but a mere Equine of Gold himself, not quite a master, and thus it was a great honor to have been selected to proclaim these great words.\n\n"Fellow equines, rejoice!" he bellowed, his voice echoing about the amphitheater. "You have all been selected to serve the great Covenant with the dignity befitting your status. He calls you here to act in servitude to your kind, to do what you were born to do."\n\nAs he glanced about the crowd, his eyes settled on a cloaked figure surrounded by Masters of Silver. A striking purple mane was all that could be seen beneath the cloak. She was here. He knew not if the omen was auspicious.\n\n"Rejoice, I say to you!" he continued, unabated, "for you shall be sent to adulate the Star Father's great name! You will be sent to the towns, and the cities, and the hinterlands, and you shall rule in his name against the avian kind. You shall be the bastion that stands before the subtle corruption of the avian, and you will not falter. For this, the Star Father places his faith in you."\n\nWordlessly, the host of the Equines of Gold came before the speaker to receive their assignments. He looked to the crowd, but he could no longer spot the shock of purple among them."

They're all confused for a moment but they all quickly decide that it worked and that Hiram has actually managed to mantle the Godhead, transcending beyond mortality and escaping the cycle of life and rebirth that traps Equinity in the material world and giving them an entity that will be able to fight Za'al Maar in the immaterial world.

However it should be noted that due to the sheer diversity of the §rCovenant§!'s leadership, the form this new model economy shall take is still a matter of intense debate.\n\nThe first amongst these factions are the £faction_tur_kurdish §rZynskaites§! led by the Trotkatian equinepologist §rQarnaim Sikarbaalid§!. This faction takes their name from the infamous Zeblu prophet Zynskai, whom ordained that cosmopolitanism and all of its influences must actively be fought against lest the Zeblu are to be destroyed. Thus the £faction_tur_kurdish §rZynskaites§! preach a return to the arcadian lifestyle of the original Zebras, traditional guild based production, the downsizing of urban areas and most importantly of all the militarisation of every aspect of society.\n\nTheir chief rival is the £civ_factory_output §rZidonite§! faction headed by the famed §rZurite§! mathematician §rZisa Zaalatit§!. Their name is an homage to the alleged legendary founder of §YColthage§!, Queen Zido under whom the city began its meteoric rise to the forefront of Zonician politics. As the name suggests the faction is primarily based upon the principles of urban modernisation, reinforcing the §rAscendacy§!'s already existing caste system and the maximisation of the country's industrial and economic output.\n\n£faction_tur_kurdish §rZynskaite§! economic influence is: [HIE.GetAgrarianPopularity]\n£civ_factory_output §rZidonite§! economic influence is: [HIE.GetUrbanitePopularity]\n\nSetting the §YEconomic Policy§! of a state is irreversible will unlock additional §YEconomic Projects§! in said state based upon the selected policy.

HIE_endurance_delayed: "Consuming a bottle of this concoction causes the user to be more resilient towards pain stimuli, as well as drastically increasing their stamina, allowing them to fight for longer without rest.\n\n§GThe potion is highly addictive. Once the potion's effects dissipate, the user may find themselves struggling to do basic motoric actions for several days, which incentivizes the user to consume more of this potion.§!"
HIE_magic_crystal_delayed: "This enigmatic crystal is capable of endlessly producing carbon copies of itself by dissolving nearby magical objects, and with the crystal usable for magical weapons manufacturing and many other otherwise expensive endeavors, it is imperative that we use this magical artifact well.\n\n§CFrom an incident, it is known that any living creature that made contact with the crystal through their bare skin dies in a mere instant due to the crystal absorbing all of the creature's magic, before subsequently replicating just as it would with any magical objects."
HIE_loyalty_delayed: "After the addition and mixing of a vial of blood of an individual, the person consuming the potion will become completely obedient to the will of the one who has their blood inside the mixture for a certain amount of time.\n\n§LAdverse effects to the subject's psychology can be observed once the potion becomes fully effective: Worshipping the 'master' in question, severe nausea and vomiting, fanaticism, and an undying will to serve their master and to fulfill all of their wishes as long as this potion is active.§!"
HIE_vespers_of_invincibility_delayed: "The Vespers of Invincibility is the Guide's attempt on recreating a mystical tonic brewed by the ancient Asstyrians during the era of God Kings. Writings depict this tonic being capable of curing ills, closing wounds, and even grant the user protection from both spiritual or physical attack. The Vespers, however, are only capable of doing this for a very short period of time.\n\n§7The Vespers' incredibly toxic ingredients means that it can only be consumed by the most physically fit of equines. This does not in any manner, negate the risk of permanent infertility in the best case scenario, and complete and total organ failure in the worst, leading to an agonizing death."
HIE_heartbreaker_delayed: "This sickly green potion has the effect of draining the emotions of anycreature around the user. This emotional power is then transformed into a healing factor, granting the user a boost in stamina as well as strength, as long as there is a sufficient supply of raw emotion to feed off.\n\n§RConsuming it too much can lead to the emotionally weak to completely lose any sense of emotion, giving the potion an addicting factor as they seek to drain the emotion of others' in a vain attempt to restore their own, leading to mania, craziness, and death.§!"
HIE_kiss_delayed: "Pending rewrite ;), color code is 0"

hippone_aspj_flavor.1.t: "Zateo's March"
hippone_aspj_flavor.1.desc: "Zateo was too small, he couldn't see past the cheering throngs between him and the rhytmic thumping that the grand parade produced. Maybe he could try further along the route? Looking around, Zateo caught a look at a tiny back alley that the crowds were avoiding. Perfect! This was his way to get farther ahead in the parade. Dashing down the alleyway, Zateo thought of what he would see. The famed equines of silver in their masks, sacrificing their individualities to serve the grand ideas of the covenant! Of course, Zateo didn't quite understand what that all meant, but he knew he should be proud of them.\n\nRounding the final corner, Zateo bounded up a small hill to exit the alley before his hoof caught on a rock jutting out the side of a building. Tripping over, Zateo came crashing down on his front right knee, scraping it badly and causing it to bleed profusely. As he tried to stand, Zateo could only wince in pain as he watched the blood seeping into the cobblestones. On the edge of tears, Zateo began to call out, "Help! Please, I'm hurt!" But no creature was around. Every loyal citizen of the Ascendency was at the parade. So the young zebra curled up and tried to apply pressure to the wound. It wouldn't be fatal, he thought, but he'd be there a while.\n\n"Well, what's this then?" Zateo turned to face the new voice. Looking from where he came, he saw a hooded zebra mare holding a satchel over her shoulder. "That looks painful. Would you like some help?" Eager to get out of the situation, Zateo nodded as the mare walked over and pulled off her hood. As she applied gauze and an alchemical tonic to his knee, all he could notice was her deep purple-colored mane.\n\n"There, all done!" she said after applying the potion. Watching the wound heal at incredible speed, Zateo could scarcely believe his eyes. "Now then, try to be more careful next time."\n\n"Wait!" Zateo called out as she went to leave, "I haven't caught your name, good miss, my father would want to know who had healed my wounds."\n\nThe mare turned back for a second, before pulling up her hood and simply saying, "No one. Just a helpful guide." And then just as quickly as she had come, the mare was gone."
hippone_aspj_flavor.1.a: "Well, thanks miss!"

hippone_aspj_flavor.2.t: "Fate of the Damned"
hippone_aspj_flavor.2.desc: ""Useless Za’al-Maar afflicted avians," the officer muttered. "Twenty-one god damn hours, and he still refuses to talk." Taking off his mask, the officer walked over to his chair in the Colthage Municipal Securities division office. The military police of the city of Colthage. Kicking a trash can by his desk over, the officer plopped himself down with a huff, and he went to the paperwork at his desk. This Avian had been found with government documents trying to flee the city. He wished from deep down inside his heart that he could just end the hippogriff's life, but orders from the top said he needed info. Shaking his head, he could still hear his partner going at it in the other room. The prisoner's wail's of pain brought him some joy, at least. If the Avian wouldn't talk, they'd just hurt him more.\n\nLooking down at his paperwork, he was shocked when he looked up to see a hooded zebra in front of him. Shooting up, he grabbed for his sidearm before he recognized the face under the hood. The purple-haired zebra.\n\n"Ah, I see you finally noticed me." She quipped. "I had hope that the city's defenders were a bit more alert."\n\nThe officer inhaled and exhaled slowly. He was in a foul mood, but now was not the time to mouth off to an equine of gold, "I apologize for my failure, miss. What brings you to our station?"\n\n"Orders from the palace of the teacher. That prisoner is to be transferred to my care immediately. My squad will be here tomorrow morning at 09.00 to pick it up." And then, as quickly as she came, she was gone.\n\nThe officer smirked and then began to chuckle. That's what that prisoner deserves! Everyone knows what happens to those who go with the purple-haired zebra! They become soulless husks of themselves before they finally meet the fate of all Avian scum. Serves him right for not answering their questions. If endless torture is a fate worse than death, then there are no words to describe her cursed embrace."

hippone_aspj_flavor.3.t: "The Guide and The Teacher"
hippone_aspj_flavor.3.desc: "Pulling back her hood and releasing her purple mane, the Guide got a better look at the door in front of her. It was simple, but she knew that the Star Father's personal lab was behind it. The equines of silver and gold which had escorted her here were instructed to leave when they were a full forty paces away. Knocking three times, the Guide took a step back, not sure of what would happen. She had met Hiram before, but not like this. This was an official summons, entirely different to what she was used to. As the door opened, the Guide was shocked, but not for the reasons she thought she might be.\n\n"Ah, my dearest Guide! Come in, come in!" Hiram smiled warmly and invited the Guide in. He was disheveled and dirty, covered in muck and stains. Hiram had converted the room into a mixture of a laboratory and a greenhouse and was tending to his plants when she arrived. "Apologies for my appearance," Hiram muttered to himself, "I must have lost track of time."\n\"My teacher, you must rest! The nation relies on you being of sound mind." the Guide managed to sputter out a few words. \n\nHiram glared at her, "Are you insinuating I am not of sound mind?" But before the Guide could even respond, Hiram waved a hoof at her and continued, "Don't worry, I know you meant it as a joke." Moving around the room, Hiram stripped himself of his gardening apron and gloves, returned to the Guide, and sat her down at a chair by his desk, looking far more official.\n\n"Now, my good Guide, I have a task for you." She nodded, "Anything you command."\n\nHiram smiled and continued, "I have a dream, a dream of alchemy on a scale never before attempted. Potions that could change the very forces of reality. All the power of the fragments of the Godhead, fractured into the races of equinity, their pure essence made manifest into concoctions, mighty weapons to smite the avian!" Hiram's voice began to peak, booming with the rhetoric of all his lectures. "I believe that these potions, all of them at once, could together form enough of the essence of the Godhead that an individual, pure of spirit and ascended in mind, body, and soul, could truly become one with the spirit realm again."\n\nHiram paused, and turned to the Guide, "Will you help me?""

hippone_jrnl_eq.1.t: "A Stroke of Fortune"
hippone_jrnl_eq.1.desc: "It was on the seventh day that the expedition party had its first stroke of fortune. One of the Equines of Silver had spotted a flash of brilliant emerald green and deep sea blue among the sooty gray that made up the landscape of this part of the dragon island. At this point, the party was anxious for any lead, as they had yet to see any dragon, large or small, on their trip thus far. Thus, they sailed to the area where the stallion had spotted the flash of color an hour prior.\n\n"We have found tracks, my lady Guide," a Master of Silver began, kneeling as he did, "headed due west along the beach, only a few hours old. It appears to be those of a juvenile dragon, separated from the rest of its kind."\n\n"Well done, commander," the Guide replied, "It appears that your legionnaires have good eyesight. Ready your troops, we'll head out at once."\n\nWith a nod, the Equine stalked off towards the ship, barking orders to resupply and be ready to march. The Guide found her eyes drawn to the sky once more, searching for the telltale sign of a dragon's passage overhead, but the sky remained mercifully clear. Even a singular adult would be too much for her small band to manage, but a juvenile? She felt her mouth split into the beginnings of a grin."
hippone_jrnl_eq.1.a: "A juvenile would be just perfect."

hippone_jrnl_misc.0.t: "Embers"
hippone_jrnl_misc.0.desc: "It had taken the better part of the day before the search party caught up with its elusive prey. It had been a simple matter to track it; the creature had made little effort to conceal its path, and the expert scouts that accompanied her made child's play of the effort. Now, a cave lay before them, with a soft glow emanating from its entrance alongside a mournful sniffling. Holding up a hoof for quiet, the Guide stalked ahead alone past the mouth of the cave into the hillside beyond.\n\nA dragon that was curled into a ball inside the cave around a small, poorly made campfire. It was unmistakably a juvenile; it was much smaller than a fully grown dragon and did not yet have a pair of wings, yet at the same time it stood about as tall as any adult zebra. A quick glance showed it to be in good shape for its age, with an excellent physique, and a pallor that spoke of good organ functionality. It was the perfect specimen.\n\nAs the Guide stalked forwards, she kicked a stray pebble on the floor, and the dragon unfurled with a shot, tears in its eyes. "H-hello?" it spoke into the darkness, a waver in its voice, "I-is anyone there? Please, I need help."\n\nThe Guide strode forwards into the light of the flames. "Do not be afraid, little one," she bade, acutely aware of the knife concealed beneath her cloak.\n\nThe dragon's tears continued unabated, and it sniffled as it struggled to speak. "Can you help me? I fell off my mama's back and got hurt, and now I'm lost. I don't know where they went and it hurts."\n\n"Yes, little one," the Guide spoke, creeping ever closer, "I will help you find your mother."\n\n"D-do you promise?" the dragon asked, a note of hope coming into its voice.\n\n"I promise," the Guide lied. She put one hoof on the dragon's shoulder, as if to bring it in for a hug, and with one swipe she brought the knife along the dragon's neck.\n\nIt was over in moments, and the sobbing subsided."

# Hjortland Expedition
hippone_jrnl_eq.2.t: "An Unexpected Angle"
hippone_jrnl_eq.2.desc: "A sudden crash and series of muttered curses snapped the Guide out of the book she was reading. She was seated at a desk in a small flat her expedition had rented for their stay in Hjortland, paging through tome after tome in an effort to track down one of the ingredients that she needed for the Teacher's potions: the tears of a Hydra. The results so far had been... frustrating, to say the least.\n\n"And what do you think that you're doing?" she snapped at the careless Equine of Silver behind her. The mare was standing over what had once been a neat pile of books, that were now strewn every which way on the floor.\n\nThe Mare snapped to a sudden attention at the scrutiny. "A-apologies, ma'am, I mean, my lady Guide. I was just thinking-"\n\n"You are of the caste of Silver, not of the caste of Gold," the Guide interrupted, "you're not supposed to think, but to be a dumb brute that will keep me safe." The Guide paused, weighing her options. She hadn't been having much luck finding any information on her own. If this mare had a good idea, that made life easier, and if she didn't, well, then she could always be sent back to Colthage for reeducation. She sighed. "Say your piece," she ordered.\n\n"Yes my lady," the Equine yelped, somehow managing to stand even straighter, "I was just thinking about the bedtime stories my ma used to tell me, about boogeymares living under the bridge, and thought that maybe any place with something as scary as a hydra might tell some stories about that?"\n\nThe Guide stood still for a moment, processing, before diving into the stack to find a book of fairy tales that she had acquired on a whim. Flipping through, she settled on a tale that took place in- "The swamp," she uttered aloud, flipping back to an almanac of Olenia. "There," she said, placing her hoof on a large, swampy area, "Karpalosuot." She smiled, her face flush with triumph, and the Equine returned the expression. "What is your name, legionnaire?" she asked."
hippone_jrnl_eq.2.a: "Elishat Zarthas, my lady."

hippone_jrnl_eq.3.t: "An Unorthodox Plan"
hippone_jrnl_eq.3.desc: "It had taken several days by hoof for the hills of the Olenian highlands to slowly make way to the marshes of Karpalosuot. The journey itself had been rather simple, but by the time that the landscape made way to fetid, stinking pools of stagnant water, everyzebra's nerves were beginning to grow thin.\n\n"It occurs to me," the Guide said, ducking underneath a low hanging branch with an undignified grunt, "that we have yet to discuss what to do when we actually reach the creature that we have been seeking."\n\n"What is there to discuss, my lady?" a Master of Silver grunted in response, "simple force of arms will force the creature into submission, whereupon we may harvest the creature for its tears at our leisure."\n\n"I worry about our band's ability to fell such a foe," the Guide replied, "the hydra is said to be a large creature, and while I don't doubt the prowess of your troops, I do worry that we simply don't have enough zebras to confront such a creature."\n\n"Why do we need to fight at all?" a voice chimed in from the rear of the formation. The Guide turned to see Elishat, the zebra who had given her the clue to locate the Hydra, was the one who had spoken up.\n\nThe Master of Silver grew incensed at the interruption. "Quiet, you!" he snapped, but the Guide cut him off.\n\n"Let her speak," bade the Guide, "Elishat, explain yourself. How do you propose to get tears from this creature without conflict?"\n\n"Well," Elishat begin, collecting her thoughts, "poetry always made me sad. Maybe we can read the hydra some sad poetry to make it cry."\n\nThe Guide ran the idea through her head. It was foolish, but it was just foolish enough to work. "Fine. Commander," she ordered, "send one of your legionnaires to find the saddest poem that they can find.""
hippone_jrnl_eq.3.a: "If this doesn't work, we'll fight."

hippone_jrnl_misc.1.t: "An Unforeseen Result"
hippone_jrnl_misc.1.desc: ""Oh, how I compare thee to a fetid breeze!" the Guide began, orating from the scroll that she held in her hooves. The Equines of Silver had returned from their expedition into town with a collection of poems that they claimed, as per the merchants they had purchased them from, would "charm the hide off of even a changeling."\n\nStill, the guide couldn't help but feel rather foolish. She was standing knee deep on the banks of a great pool of stagnant water, proclaiming poetry that wasn't even sad to nothing she could see. She could feel that this was the right place, however, and mastered any feelings of embarrassment.\n\n"Thy breath smells like a putrescent cabbage," the Guide continued, "and thine visage is compared to a slug of the sea! Thy scent may be compared to an unwashed loon, whose presence is as welcome as that of a cock at dawn!"\n\nAt once, a great rumbling overtook the area. Great limbs flew from the swamps, and a many headed hydra appeared before the Guide and the assembled party.\n\n"Oh how I love thine many heads!" the Guide spoke, unabated, as if reciting a bit of sorcery. She spoke as if at rote, "Each head more foolish than the last, and each more putrid! I can barely stand within the presence of ye, that ye are so repulsive!"\n\nThe hydra stood menacingly above the assembled host of zebras. It stood many heads above the assembled group, and it was all the Guide could do to not tremble at the sight. She took a deep breath, gathered h1er thoughts, and continued the poem. "Despite how terrible ye may be, I still wish to be with thee! I wish to adulate within thy weathered brows, and to live within thy measured gaze. For though thy may stink, and scare with abandon, thine will always be mine."\n\nThe clearing was quiet. The Guide stood still, sweating with effort, as the hydra seemed to almost consider the words. It let out a laugh, a great guffaw, and at once the swamp was alight with the great heaving laughter of the hydra that stood before them. The Guide strode forward, sensing what was about to happen, and held out a flask as a singular tear fell from the hydra's eye."

hippone_jrnl_eq.4.t: "Welcome To The Queendom"
hippone_jrnl_eq.4.desc_1: "The changeling hive city of Ditrysium stank. It was the first thing that the Guide noticed as she stepped off the ship onto the bustling docks of the port city; the brine in the air from the ocean mingled poorly with the smog emanating from within the depths of the hive. Trying not to gag, she quickly unscrewed a potion from her belt, the scent of the poultice blocking out the rest. The guide turned to Elishat, herself walking down to the docks, but the fellow zebra paid no heed, instead scanning the city for any signs of threat. "I do not like this place, my lady Guide," she said, "are we sure these changelings can be trusted?"\n\n"General Cardo is a respected associate of the Teacher," the Guide admonished, "and changelings themselves are equine."\n\n"Equine or not, there's something wrong with this place, something that I can't quite put my hoof on," Elishat responded, "I don't trust it."\n\n"You worry too much," the Guide chided gently, a smile in her voice. She expected little difficulty in finding the next two items that the Teacher had requested, especially with the promised help of such a decorated general as Lacin Cardo himself.\n\nThe changeling in question stood at the head of the docks, flanked by soldiers of his own. "It is with great honor that I welcome you and your party to the Changeling Lands, Lady Guide," he said, his face inscrutable.\n\nThe Guide gave a slight smile in response to the address. "Please, the honor is mine. We have traveled far to be here, and are eager to begin our journey."\n\nThe general nodded. "In due time, my lady. For now, why don't you and your companions rest?" He gestured to his soldiers, who began to march down the docks. "My changelings here will show your soldiers to their quarters. In the meanwhile, why don't you and I explore the Hive? I'm sure that your Star Father has much to gain from a more formal partnership with the queendom."\n\nThe Guide tried to hide a grimace. More time in this smelly hive? She supposed she could bear it for a while. They had been on that ship for a long time after all."

The zebra had been uncharacteristically quiet in the handful of weeks it had taken them to reach the shores of Key Lake. At first, the Guide had felt almost insulted at getting the cold shoulder, and wanted to wait for her companion to make the first move. Now, however, the Guide simply wanted her Elishat back.\n\nElishat, for her part, looked surprised at being addressed. "Nothing troubles me, my lady Guide," she responded. Elishat paused, almost a half second too long, and the Guide frowned slightly. "Why, do you sense something wrong?"\n\n"No, I just-" the Guide stammered, trying to find the words. "Is this about the changelings? I know you didn't trust them, are you upset with me for allying with them?"\n\nElishat blinked. "No, my lady," she responded, "I could never be angry with you. And you were right to trust the changelings, they have been nothing but helpful so far."\n\nThe Guide sighed. General Cardo and his entourage had been rather useful, she could admit, but she found herself starting to agree with Elishat's original mistrust. Something seemed incredibly wrong, and she couldn't put her hoof on it.\n\nElishat coughed. "Will that be all, my lady?"\n\n"What?" the Guide asked, startled out of her recollection, "I- yes, that will be all."\n\nElishat nodded, falling silently behind to the rear of the column. General Cardo called out from ahead. "My lady Guide," he shouted, his voice carrying across the snowbanks, "we have arrived."\n\nNodding, the Guide trotted forward, unhooking a flask from her belt and silently scooping some water out of the lake. At least she was almost done."

"What are you doing?" he demanded, shooting back to his hooves.\n\nThe Guide stopped, knife in hoof. "I require but a sample of the First Queen. I will be quick."\n\nGeneral Cardo stared silently.

The second fell into another crowd of changelings, simply immolating them in a torrent of alchemical fire.\n\nIgnoring the screams around her, the Guide charged forwards, retrieving her knife and throwing a smokescreen potion into the snow.

# Manehattan expedition
hippone_jrnl_eq.7.t: "Welcome to the Big Apple"
hippone_jrnl_eq.7.desc: "The sprawl of the city that lay before her was unlike anything the Guide had ever seen before.\n\nThe port city of Manehattan had been selected as the perfect point of entry into the sprawling Equestrian nation. It was a huge metropolitan city, and while the thought of being in such close proximity to avians disgusted her, she could admit that the multiracial makeup of the city would make it easy for a lone zebra to blend in.\n\nShe had booked passage on a container ship destined for the metropolis, opting to travel separately from her expeditionary party so as to avoid any suspicion. As the ship sailed past the Statue of Friendship, she could barely contain her sense of awe at the skyline that seemed to stretch for miles. Giant towers of steel and glass like she had never seen before seemed to reach into the sky as in supplication to the gods above. It was impressive, somewhat intimidating sight, and for once, the Guide found herself feeling rather small.\n\nA small patrol boat led the Guide’s ship into port, docking at an otherwise unoccupied pier. Disembarking with a word of thanks to the captain, she trotted up the dock towards a mercifully small line in front of a small checkpoint, a small sign hung above it labled simply "Customs."\n\nAt the head of the line was a stallion, equine, thankfully, wearing an easygoing smile. "Hey, how’s it goin?" he asked, his accent strange to the Guide’s ears. He ripped a page off the pad of paper in front of him. "Name?"\n\n"You may refer to me as the Guide."\n\nThe stallion’s smile didn’t fade, but it seemed to freeze on his face as he gave her a long, discerning look. "Okay," he said, drawing out the end of the word, "and what brings you to Manehattan today miss Guide?"\n\n"Business, of a sort," she responded, ignoring the look on the stallion’s face, "I’m meeting a friend of mine here."\n\n"Well, let me be the first to welcome you to our great city," the stallion said, passing her a signed slip of paper."

hippone_jrnl_misc.3.desc: "The safehouse was located in Bronclyn, one of Manehattan's outer boroughs. Compared to the bright lights and bustle of the city proper, Bronclyn was more down to earth: not subdued, per say, but more modest.\n\nThe particular neighborhood that the Guide found herself in seemed to be populated entirely by thestrals, the bat-ponies out and about despite the late hour. The safehouse itself was a modest building, some five stories high. The other members of the expedition party had gathered here at the behest of their benefactor, a certain thestral by the name of Starry Glory.\n\nThe thestral in question sat alone with the Guide in a small sitting room at the top floor of the safehouse. The two had been deliberating for the better part of an hour, and it seemed as if the thestral had finally come to some kind of conclusion.\n\n"Bales," Starry said, placing a hoof onto the map sitting on the table in front of them. "It's got the greatest libraries in Equestria, if not the world. If you can't find information on what you're looking for there, then the information just doesn't exist."\n\nThe Guide strode over, humming as she went. "Perusing through so many tomes might be more difficult than you think, especially searching without aim. I must confess that I am unfamiliar with how you Equestrians categorize information."\n\nThe thestral waved off any concerns. "Don't worry about that, I have a buddy who works as a librarian there, one of the few thestrals to hold the position," he said with a note of pride, "He'd be more than willing to help us out."\n\n"I guess that's settled, then," the Guide said, rising to her hooves."

It was as if she was serviced by an entire army of Equines of Gold; she knew that she would always think fondly of this place.\n\nHer time among the stacks had been incredibly useful thus far, and she had located just about everything that she needed to find. Parasprites would be easy to find, as they were everywhere in Equus, but it was mentioned that a particularly large concentration of them could be found in the sleepy town of Hollow Shades.\n\nThe Dust of Starfall, on the other hand, would be harder to find. The tomes that she had read mentioned the city of Stalliongrad, a city that the Guide was not particularly eager to visit. Stalliongrad was the city of the crypto-avian marksists, equines who had fully surrendered to the foul influence of Za'al-Maar. She shuddered at the thought. She would visit, of course, as the Teacher demanded, but she'd be lying if she said that she was anticipating the trip with any particular gladness.\n\nAnother location that came up frequently in her search was the small village of Ponyville. It sat on the Everfree forest, a woodland known for its abundance of alchemical reagents. It was also supposed to be incredibly frightening, though the Guide doubted that she would be so easily rattled as the average pony.\n\nThe Guide shut the book in front of her, letting out a long sigh. Ponyville and the Everfree forest would have to wait until the end of her trip. Now, the choice of destination lay before her."

hippone_jrnl_eq.13.t: "Free Passage Through a Red Land"
hippone_jrnl_eq.13.desc: "When the Guide had first passed the border separating Equestria and Stalliongrad, she had expected to feel something. Stalliongrad was the greatest stronghold of crypto-avian marksism on Equus, if not the world. Za'al-Maar's influence should have been invested heavily here, yet the Guide could sense nothing.\n\nPerhaps the influence of the great enemy was more subtle than she had anticipated.\n\nNevertheless, the Guide, alongside Starry Glory and the rest of her entourage, had been traveling north along the coastline for about a week. They had been trotting in the direction of a small village that had been mentioned several times in the tomes from Bales. When they finally arrived, they had managed to speak to one of the braver ponies residing there, a mare who introduced herself as Salty Breeze.\n\n"Yes, I know what it is that you are seeking," she said, speaking in between a stalk of barley. The Guide had been hailed by the mare when they were a small ways away outside of the village, curious as to why such a motley crew had come so far out into the middle of nowhere. When they had mentioned what they were after, her cheerful expression had grown somber. "It was a little over three months ago. Some of the local boys were out fishing, and they heard a big boom. Something struck a small island nearby, just a few miles off the coast there, and a tidal wave from the impact knocked their skiff over. Two of them, they didn’t make it back," she said. The mare hung her head low, giving a small sigh. "The rest of the boys say the island’s different now, cursed. They have also seen some strange boats around the area" At this, a look of genuine concern entered the pony’s face. "If you all are going out there, you must be careful, yes? No telling what might happen."\n\nThe Guide was shocked at the level of compassion that Salty Breeze had shown them. This was somepony who had willingly given themselves over to the enemy? She shook her head. It wasn’t important. They had their destination, and that was all that mattered."
hippone_jrnl_eq.13.a: "We'll be careful."

hippone_jrnl_misc.7.t: "The Tainted Isle"
hippone_jrnl_misc.7.desc: "The island lay completely still.\n\nGone was the song of the crickets that had been ever present on the mainland. The whisper of wind through the trees was absent, replaced only by the last gasp of a dying mare. Even the sound of the crashing of the waves grew silent as the party drew their anchors and landed on the island's shores, and all that remained was the sound of soft breathing, and the beating of the Guide's heart.\n\nIt grew obvious to the Guide that a great magical calamity had fallen upon the tiny islet, likely during the starfall that had brought them here. The land itself had seemed to take on an alien appearance. The grass lay flat on the ground, each blade seeming to point away from the epicenter of the fall. The trees grew at unusual angles, the branches forming fractal patterns of the trunks that they sprang from. The Guide could see no signs of any wildlife; there were no tracks, no droppings, not even a leaf out of place.\n\n"Well this is suitably ominous," Starry Glory quipped, a smirk on his face.\n\n"Quiet," the Guide snapped, "we do not have time for foolishness. The sooner that we get the Dust of Starfall, the sooner we can leave."\n\nOrdering two of her Equines of Silver to remain behind to guard the ship, she took the rest of the party towards the center of the island.\n\nThe closer that the party got to the center, however, the stranger the island seemed to become. The paths they took seemed to wander, and anypony who left sight of the main group often found themselves away from where they thought they were. The grass began to shimmer in the night sky, and the water collecting in the pools took on magical hues, inviting those who looked to peer closer into their depths.\n\nEventually, the Guide and her party reached the center of the island. The fallen star lay in a large crater, glowing faintly in the stillness of the night. Starry stepped forwards, but the Guide lay her hoof across his chest, her eyes widening."
hippone_jrnl_misc.7.a: "An Ursa Major lay sleeping around the star."

hippone_jrnl_misc.8.t: "The Fallen Star"
hippone_jrnl_misc.8.desc: ""Well now that is a problem," Starry Glory whispered, staring at the Ursa Major that lay sleeping below. He glanced to the Guide. "So? What do you think, do you have any voodoo magic to take that thing down?"\n\nThe Guide grimaced. "My potions may be powerful, but they're certainly not enough to take down an Ursa Major. No, the best thing to do is to sneak around it and collect the Dust of Starfall without waking the beast." She hummed, thinking for a moment, and turned fully to the thestral standing beside her. "I need you to fly me down there."\n\n"What?" Starry yelped. He gulped, glancing back down to the Ursa Major, still sleeping, thankfully, and continued in a more quiet tone. "Are you crazy? I can't carry you down there, you're too heavy." The Guide gave him a look, and the thestral looked away, stammering, "I mean, just-" he took a breath, "Why don't I just fly down there and grab it myself?"\n\n"You don't know what to get," the Guide said. Unspoken was the assertion that she simply didn't trust him. "It has to be me."\n\nGrimacing, the Thestral grabbed the guide under her hooves, and the Guide pretended to ignore the comments about her weight. The two flew into the pit, hovering over the rock, and the Guide collected a few motes of dust emanating from the star. Silently, she held the flask up to the thestral, who took it as his cue to leave. As he began to fly away, however, a strong wind blew through the pit, and the thestral lost his grip, dropping the Guide onto the head of the gargantuan monster.\n\nTumbling off the beast's snout, the Guide impacted the ground with a huff. Holding her breath, she could only watch as the great beast's eyes slowly opened, staring directly at her.\n\n"Run," she whispered.\n\nShe shot to her feet and scrambled out of the pit as quickly as her hooves would take her. "Run!" she shouted to the assembled equines. Not caring if they followed her or not, she glanced behind her as the creature stood to its full height, blotting out the moon. It let out a roar that shook the foundations of the very earth.\n\nThe Guide turned back. Racing down to where the ship had docked, she saw that the two zebras she had left behind had already begun to weigh the anchor, and was pulling out slowly. She took a running leap onto the boat and promptly collapsed, breathing heavily at the exertion. Starry Glory landed next to her, and she turned to him."

hippone_jrnl_gr.1.desc: ""We have arrived."\n\nThe Guide opened her eyes. It was time to begin the journey into the heart of Za'al-Maar's creations: The continent of Griffonia. She glanced at the Equine of Silver who had awoken her. Zethro was relatively short and softspoken, but he had proven himself more than capable on multiple occasions during the rise of the Ascendancy. The real reason that she had brought him, however, was that he had spent several years of his life traveling all around Griffonia before settling down in Hippone.\n\nWithout another word, the two zebras ascended to the boat's deck and took in the scenery of Seguro, a flourishing city on the coast of [413.owner.GetNameDef]. Ships were docking and departing all around them while large crowds of different creatures mingled with one another.\n\n"It's quite different from back home," mused Zethro before turning to face the Guide, "I'm not proud of my history here, but I hope that my knowledge of Griffonia will be of use to you."\n\n"Yes..." The Guide didn't meet his gaze, having noticed something that was setting off alarms in her head. Though the stain of the avian was not overwhelming here, she could spot a few griffons throughout the port. What had really grabbed her attention was a blasphemous sight: a griffon and a zebra were embracing one another, then closed their faces together as if they were...\n\n"I will be right back." Before Zethro could ask what she was doing, the Guide had already entered the midst of the crowd."

The two seemed to notice her as she got closer, though that did not slow her advance.\n\nThe griffon initially wore an expression of worry, then it turned into concern as he addressed the stranger storming towards him. "Are you all right? Can we help-" His words were cut off by a swift movement that saw a dagger now protruding from his throat. He gurgled and weakly reached for the blade, then collapsed. The zebra beside him gasped, not able to speak from the shocking event she just witnessed.\n\nThe Guide pressed the blade down to ensure the griffon's death. "Such filth has no place in this world. Oh ye who have poisoned the equine, I grant thee the fate you deserve." She retrieved the blade and turned towards the dead griffon's lover, "And you shall join him for rejecting your equinity!"\n\nThe other zebra screamed briefly before her life too came to an end. The crowd began to panic as they saw the murders. The Guide stood motionless, enjoying the righteous feeling of slaying the unclean. Just as some security had begun to take notice, Zethro arrived to usher the Guide away. "There will be time for killing avians later, we can't afford to cause scenes like this! We have to go!"\n\nThe Guide whipped her knife towards Zethro in anger, preparing to scold him for suggesting that she should have spared the griffon. However, she spotted what looked like the local authorities heading towards the two of them and thought better of it. She quickly put her knife away and nodded. "Very well. Let us make haste.""

hippone_jrnl_gr.2.desc: "The journey took the two zebras north through the mountains of Barrad. Though the harsh and sudden climate shifts were loathsome at best and hazardous at worse, their tenacity and willpower saw them through. After all, Zethro had assured the Guide that her first destination was worth any sacrifice to see at least once.\n\nAnd see it they did. Inside the land of Pònaidhean at the bottom of a narrow valley was a breathtaking sight: the city of Dail Mhòr, which was a radical departure from anything that the Guide had seen up to this point. Gone was all semblance of modern civilization, instead replaced largely by vast, extravagant monasteries and temples that stretched into the valley as far as the eye could see.\n\nZethro broke the awe-stricken silence. "The monks of this land are practiced in all sorts of arts, both physical and mystical. They live in harmony with each other and the wildlife, including the miniscule Breezies." He paused, seeming to hesitate, "That is why we're here, right? The Breezies?"\n\nAs the Guide opened her mouth to answer, she noticed a small group of floating critters not too far away. She smiled, "That's correct. Would those happen to be Breezies over there?"\n\nZethro squinted his eyes, then nodded, "Yes, though I would recommend caution. They can be troublesome if provoked."\n\n"Then I'll be quick." The Guide started off towards the Breezies, taking care to tread lightly so as to not draw too much attention to herself. She drew her knife, intending to quickly perform the deed, when... wait...\n\nShe had gotten close enough that she could see the Breezies clearly. Truthfully, she had never seen one before, but she knew that the Teacher required the wings of the creatures in front of her. What gave her pause was how... equine-like they were. These couldn't have been Cosmic Mistakes, they bore the shape of tiny, floating ponies.\n\nAfter a moment's hesitation, the Guide readied her knife, took a deep breath, and steeled herself."

He sat down next to a tree, making himself comfortable.\n\n"Perhaps after this is done, I could introduce you to him as thanks for your help so far."\n\n"I... that would be an honor."\n\nThe two had settled down next to a river north of the city of Ivanhorn. The territories of Wittenland were a treat to wander through, with many a talented pony showing the two travelers the wonders of Wittenlandic traditions. The best part was the local food, which was simply heavenly.\n\nHowever, their mission remained.

They'd have to find the next ingredient without Westerly's help.\n\nThe next few days were spent wandering around chasing rumors of where the mythical phoenix might live. So rare were the creatures that there were naught more than a few dozen confirmed sightings of them in recorded history... at least in the wild.\n\nAfter the fourth day of searching, exhaustion began to set in for Zethro, causing him to trip. "Maybe... maybe we'd be better off trying to find one in a- *cough* -a zoo somewhere?"\n\nThe Guide stopped to help Zethro get back on his hooves, "The phoenix is here, I know it. We have to keep searching." After patting him on the back, Zethro weakly nodded and continued searching with her.\n\nAfter a few more hours of fruitless searching, Zethro collapsed from heat exhaustion. The Guide rushed to his aid, cursing herself for pushing him too hard. She retrieved some water and carefully poured it down his throat, when suddenly...\n\nA bright, orange-red feather slowly fell in front of her, gently landing on top of Zethro's chest. As soon as it touched him, she felt a chilling warmth flow through him. Zethro's eyes shot open and he stood up as if he was perfectly healthy. "Woah!" he shouted, "What was that?! I feel amazing!"\n\nThe Guide sat speechless. She picked up the feather, then looked to the sky in hopes of finding where it came from. She caught a glimpse of something crimson flying behind the mountainside."
hippone_jrnl_misc_gr.2.desc_2: "To the zebras' mild disappointment, Westerly Leeward was not with the heavily armed squad. Said squad had explained that Westerly was preoccupied with happenings back in Jezeragrad and was unable to leave, so he sent one of his trusted spec-ops teams to assist "his favorite foreigner's student" with whatever she needed.\n\nAfter getting introductions and the mission briefing out of the way, the squad of eight ponies accompanied the Guide and Zethro to a rumored nesting location of the mythical phoenix. So rare were the creatures that there were naught more than a few dozen confirmed sightings of them in recorded history... at least in the wild.\n\nSoon enough, they arrived at a promising area. They settled into various hidden vantage points and began to wait, hoping that their intel was correct.\n\nAs the hours passed, some of them began to make hushed small talk with one another. One of the armed ponies turned to the Guide and whispered, "What do you need a phoenix feather for anyways?"\n\n"It is for the Teacher. He is working on a grand project, and I am gathering its vital components."\n\nThe pony turned his head, curious. "What sort of project?"\n\nThe Guide considered explaining the basics of the Ascendancy to the pony, but opted not to on account of how many other questions it would lead to. "Even I don't know what it is. But I trust him to right the wrongs in this world."\n\nBANG!\n\nA gunshot echoed throughout the mountains. The Guide saw a crimson-orange being plummet from the sky, feathers scattering everywhere. Just before it hit the ground, it ignited into flames. With a glorious screech, the phoenix stretched its wings out of the fire and corrected its fall, rising to fly once more into the sky."

However, Zethro paused to take another look around the place. The longer he looked, the more perplexed he became. "This architecture... it's not Wittenlandic."\n\nThe innkeeper coughed and chuckled, placing his hoof on an old desk, "You've got a sharp eye. I modeled this inn after my old house in Visaginas." The Guide stopped walking up the stairs, suddenly interested in listening to their conversation.\n\nZethro's eyes lit up. "The Vartai region! They always had such an interesting culture there..." His lighthearted expression vanished as he remembered one crucial detail, "But the Griffons ruined it, like they do to everything."\n\n"Yes, though..." The innkeeper's breathing became slightly ragged, "There are a few good ones."\n\n"Impossible."

It was peaceful; everypony was friends with everygriff and everygriff helped out everypony. That changed when a griffon named Pallas Dusktalon took control of Longsword. He and the 'Reformisten' he served began to implement several harsh policies towards ponies. It came to be known as the Longswordian Genocide, as Dusktalon sought nothing less than the total extermination of ponykind.\n\n"My family and I, along with hundreds of other ponies were brought to a concentration camp. The Reformisten told us that we were going to be deported, but everypony knew why we were really there: They were going to execute us. All of us. And we would have been executed too, had it not been for-"\n\n"Za'al-Maar's demons have hurt you."

I'm telling a story!" He paused, waiting for the Guide to respond. When she didn't, he continued. "As I was saying, we would have all been shot, but then a miracle happened: one of the Reformisten officers conspired to save us. No, don't open your mouths until I am done!\n\n"Her name was Raga Andris. She was rather not much older than you, young mare, and she was a very promising soldier in the Reformisten. Raga was well on her way to becoming a general when she was assigned to carry out the latest batch of executions. She oversaw our camp, and when the time came to line us up against the wall, she stopped. For a solid minute, we waited there, wondering what our fate would be. She stared directly at me and my family, who by the grace of Varėnė had kept us together to this point. Raga then suddenly ordered the other Reformisten griffons to leave, claiming that she wanted to do the deed herself.""

The innkeeper opened the desk and retrieved a photograph, offering it to Zethro and the Guide. The Guide took the photo. It depicted a young griffon and pony hugging one another. "I also found out that she used to be a close friend of my late son before she joined the Reformisten. Even though she made many terrible choices in life, in the end she chose to be a hero."\n\nThe Guide stared at the photo. This didn't make any sense. The creatures of Za'al-Maar aren't like this. It wasn't possible for them to be so selfless. There had to be something else, another factor. The stallion must have been lying...but he wasn't, she could tell. Her hooves shook. The story and photo were a maddening contradiction to everything she believed in. There wasn't-\n\n"You can keep the photo."\n\nThe Guide froze. Her eyes darted to the innkeeper, who simply smiled at her. Zethro sensed the tense atmosphere and quietly excused himself to go to sleep. After he hurried up the stairs, the innkeeper continued, "You have a lot of pain in your life. You look like the type that hides that pain by pretending to be powerful, by hurting those who disagree with you, but let me tell you: Real power is when you have every justification to kill, and you don't." The Guide was silent. "But hey, I'm just a tired, old stallion who talks too much. You have a good night, okay?""

Best to focus on the task at hoof.\n\nThe chirping of birds and the wildlife were eerily absent as they entered the Eygsic Forest. The gigantic winding trees curved into one another, forming an ominous covering that let only tiny amounts of light through. They were forced to use lanterns to see where they were going. Zethro found that he was having trouble keeping up with the Guide. Just before she left his field of view, he called out to her. "Wait! Don't you know what's in here?"\n\nThe Guide halted in her stride, then broke her long silence, "The next ingredient. It's ahead, I can feel it."\n\n"That's precisely why we need to be careful! The Eygsic Spiders are terrifyingly fierce, and you're going after the silk of one of their Queens!

Instead of answering, The Guide headed deeper into the forest. Zethro struggled after her, trying desperately not to lose sight of the Guide. Not too long after, he noticed that the trees they were passing had silk on them. He made the mistake of looking up, only to see dozens, perhaps hundreds of giant spiders crawling around on webs and tree branches above them. Though he was petrified to the bone, he didn't dare stop moving.\n\nThe Guide briefly paused at a small clearing, where a grand web was spun in front of her. It was taller than any building she'd ever seen, and in the center of it laid a behemoth of a spider surrounded by countless eggs. It sat perfectly still, watching her every move. The Guide approached a small section of the silky web and quickly cut off a part of it, then turned to leave as calmly as she entered."

The spec-ops team swiveled their weapons towards it, though they did not fire. The Guide leaned towards Zethro and whispered into his ear, "When I give the signal, follow me."\n\nZethro didn't know what the signal was meant to be, but he nodded anyways. After the forest became silent once more, the group continued onwards. Zethro made the mistake of looking up, only to see dozens, perhaps hundreds of gigantic spiders crawling around on webs and tree branches above them.

It was taller than any building the Guide had ever seen, and in the center of it laid a behemoth of a spider surrounded by countless eggs. It sat perfectly still, watching their every move.\n\nSuddenly, a gunshot rang out as one of the spec-ops members fired at a nearby spider that got too close for their liking. What followed was utter horror as numberless spiders began to descend upon the team. The Guide pulled Zethro away and began to run towards the Spider Queen's web. The spec-ops team unloaded their weapons into horde of spiders, but with every one they felled, dozens more appeared from the darkness.\n\nBy the time the Guide reached the bottom of the web, the gunfire had stopped. With a terrified Zethro in tow, she quickly cut off a piece of the silky web and turned to leave, making sure to move slowly and calmly through the masses of spiders."

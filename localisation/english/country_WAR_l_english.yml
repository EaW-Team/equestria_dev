 ### LEADER DESCRIPTIONS ###
 
 WAR_king_zarizel_ii:0 "King Barekzamal VII"
 WAR_king_zarizel_ii_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 24th of August, 984 in Zamivgazal\n\n§YBiography§!: The second son of Zamaliahon XV, Barekzamal had an idyllic childhood, free of struggle. While his brother - Zamaliahon - was subject to endless tutoring as the crown prince, Barekzamal spent his days playing with the foals of the nobility and galloping gleefully through the streets of Zamivgazal. His favourite playmate was Ummazanit Nazlayn, the daughter of a prominent noble. Although she was intended as a future bride for his brother, they were never officially engaged and she much preferred Barekzamal's company to that of his eccentric brother.\n\nWhen Zamaliahon was made king in 1001, he swiftly leapt into action. He formally renounced any intention of marrying in the near future, leaving Barekzamal and Ummazanit free to get married. The two soon sired their first foal, a colt named Hannizamal. However, since Barekzamal was technically his brother's successor, he did make an effort to educate himself on the basics of statecraft and governance. But there was no rush. After all, they were young and had their whole lives ahead of them. His brother would eventually find a nice mare and Barekzamal could live the rest of his life in bliss. Unfortunately, the gods had other plans for the young prince and in 1005 his precious world was turned upside down.\n\nAs the Storm King swept through the kingdom, Barekzamal and his family managed to escape, but his brother didn't and was slain in the Palace by the invaders. When Barekzamal found out, he was overwhelmed by grief, weeping for hours on end. After the conqueror was slain, Barekzamal returned to Zamivgazal a changed person. He quickly set to work, trying to keep the nation afloat. Although he had some success, for the most part his policies were ineffective as his inexperience betrayed him. Now, he sits uneasy on the throne as the threat of revolt grows. While not as unpopular as his father was, he definitely has his fair share of opposition. The fate of the nation rests on his haunches and it will take monumental effort on his part to keep it - and his throne - from falling out of his grasp. But Barekzamal is determined to bring Warzena into a brighter future, where he can smile with his family once more.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Kessel"

 WAR_taniiaton:0 "Zaniiaton"
 WAR_taniiaton_desc:0 "#TODO - Currently in her late 20s, daughter of a poor laborer in Zammar, she has led a difficult life. She's so poor she doesn't even have a last name. Constantly surrounded by urban laborers and peasants struggling to make ends meet, she has become acutely aware of their suffering. Managed to find a worn-out copy of the Marksist manifesto when she was around high school age and read it religiously. She eventually managed to make contact with other Marksists and quickly became the leader of their movement, organizing it like no one had before. Her goal is to bring the revolution to Zonicia and liberate its people from bourgeois exploitation.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Stephen Sen"
 WAR_benoam_zaadeh:0 "Bennoam Shimzel" 
 WAR_benoam_zaadeh_desc:0 "#TODO - A charming stallion in his mid-30s, Shimzel is the son of a middle-class worker from Zimash. He harbored an interest in history from an early age, especially ancient Warzenan history. It was during his time in university that he became enamored with the idea of creating a united Hazrumenia, with Warzena at its center. After graduating he began to draw a small but loyal following thanks to his charisma and sophistication. He eventually solidifed his ideals into a manifesto and drew in even more followers. Serving as CAMO's PR person, he allowed them to survive despite overwhelming odds and secured his power base. He and his followers will ensure that the dream of a united Hazrumenia becomes a reality, no matter what.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Ryan"
 WAR_itthozamal_ankeper:0 "Itthozamal Ankeper" 
 WAR_itthozamal_ankeper_desc:0 "#TODO- Nearing his 60s, Ankeper is the son of a well-off merchant family in Zamivgazal. The hardships of the mid-10th century imprinted themselves on him and his family began to suffer as Warzena's leadership grew ever more incompetent. When he entered higher education, he was drawn to groups that were critical of the monarchy, which were subsequently outlawed by the monarchy. Ankeper banded with others to form the WRL, an anti-monarchist club oriented around creating a democratic Zonician republic in the spirit of Zinuzel Zidalid. He met his current husband during the club's early days and the two wed a few years later. He was a prominent leader in CAMO owing to his seniority and passion. His health has begun to wane in recent years, but that won't stop him from finally bringing Zidalid's vision to life.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: DeerTrax"
 WAR_imzanit_azpin:0 "Imzanit Azpin" 
 WAR_imzanit_azpin_desc:0 "#TODO- A lovely young mare in her mid-20s, Azpin was born to pro-republican laborers in Askalion who later migrated to Zamivgazal. She was drawn to politics from a young age, driver by a burning desire to make people's lives better. This unbridled optimism, bordering on childish naivete, drew the attention of many within the WRL during her tenure at a republican-owned shop in Zamivgazal. She even caught the eyes of Ankeper, the WRL's leader, who took her in as a protege, recognizing that he needed a capable successor to entrust his vision too. Inexperienced, idealistic, and dedicated to realizing her mentor's vision, she is generally optimistic, but a little too cautious sometimes. Now at the helm of the republic, she will ensure that Ankeper's trust was not misplaced and that the WRL's efforts were not in vain.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Moonatik"

 WAR_road_to_recovery:0 "The Road To Recovery..."
 WAR_road_to_recovery_desc:0 "To say Warzena's situation is bad would be a gross understatement. However, sitting around on our rumps all day complaining won't do anyone any good and the country must stand up and begin to look towards the future once more."
 WAR_is_not_easy:0 "...Isn't An Easy One"
 WAR_is_not_easy_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, all the romantic bravado in the world isn't enough to hide the monumental challenges that face us as we attempt to rebuild the nation. But, it does work as solid motivation to keep the people going as we struggle for a brighter future."
 WAR_stop_the_bleeding:0 "Stop The Bleeding"
 WAR_stop_the_bleeding_desc:0 "Currently on its last legs and being kept barely afloat by Hippogriffian aid, the economy is in a particularly sorry state. We must take any measures necessary to stop the economy from collapsing outright, even if they're only temporary."
 WAR_the_peoples_hearts:0 "The People's Hearts"
 WAR_the_peoples_hearts_desc:0 "The Warzenan commonfolk have suffered the most from the events of the past few years and they have been almost completely demoralized. We must temper the people's hearts, to ease the pain of what came before and to prepare them for what is to follow."
 WAR_assess_the_damage:0 "Assess The Damage"
 WAR_assess_the_damage_desc:0 "Even though the abysmal state of the nation is clear to anyone who looks, the real question is how bad the damage truly is. We must assess the nation to truly understand the harm done and come up with the most effective course of action as quickly as possible."
 WAR_a_crucial_hour:0 "A Crucial Hour"
 WAR_a_crucial_hour_desc:0 "A crucial hour has befallen Warzena: will she stick to a status quo spanning the millennia, or will she start anew in this ever changing world?"
 WAR_faith_in_king:0 "Faith In The King"
 WAR_faith_in_king_desc:0 "It seems that tradition has managed to persevere once more. Now all of Warzena looks towards King Barekzamal to be the king he needs to be and the leader they believe he can be."
 WAR_a_hasty_prayer:0 "A Hasty Prayer"
 WAR_a_hasty_prayer_desc:0 "Although he has managed to keep his throne, the King has nevertheless become overburdened by stress. Hopefully, the support of the clergy and the gods will prove sufficient to aid him in these trying times."
 WAR_appease_the_rabble:0 "Appease The Rabble"
 WAR_appease_the_rabble_desc:0 "The people are uppity and a palpable tension hangs in the air. That isn't to say that their qualms are unjustified, as much of the current situation is the result of incompetent leadership. Nevertheless, if we do not assuage them soon, CAMO may be able to regain its waning momentum."
 WAR_emergency_measures:0 "Emergency Measures"
 WAR_emergency_measures_desc:0 "Although we have managed to prevent the country from collapsing outright, the situation is still tenuous at best and without further measures, may spiral completely out of our control. Even if they are temporary, these policies will ensure that the country can keep its bearings until a more permanent solution is implemented."
 WAR_traitors_among_us:0 "The Traitors Among Us..."
 WAR_traitors_among_us_desc:0 "Although we would like to believe that the royal court can be trusted, we must accept the harsh reality that there are traitors and backstabbers among us, with even the king's closest advisors being potential impostors relaying information to our enemies."
 WAR_all_around_us:0 "...And All Around Us"
 WAR_all_around_us_desc:0 "All across the country, there is a vast network of those opposed to the monarchy, consisting of a myriad of different people, coming from different walks of life. They blend in with the crowds and are nearly undetectable. But, they are not invincible. If the main agents of dissidence can be tracked down and neutralized, then the beast they built will surely follow."
 WAR_proper_coronation:0 "A Proper Coronation"
 WAR_proper_coronation_desc:0 "After 3 years of devastation and misery, Warzena is finally able to witness the coronation of her king.

 WAR_win_the_cities:0 "Win the Cities"
 WAR_win_the_cities_desc:0 "Even though Warzena is by no means an urbanized country, its cities are still the main centers of power. Currently, they host a significant amount of opposition, consisting primarily of urban nobles and conservative clergy. If we are to maintain our position, we must ensure that the cities follow our lead and not the other way around."
 WAR_secure_king:0 "Secure the Royals"
 WAR_secure_king_desc:0 "While we have managed to overthrow the monarchy itself, we can't rest on our laurels just yet. As long as the ex-royals remain out of our grasp, the restorationist movement has a figure to motivate them to continue resisting our rule. Therefore, we must move to secure the king and his family as quickly as possible, before they slip out of our control forever."
 WAR_maintain_the_country:0 "Maintain the Country"
 WAR_maintain_the_country_desc:0 "For the longest time, Warzena's extensive rural regions have been our refuge, having saved our movement from certain death many times. However, also found in the country are the landed aristocracy, who will do anything in their power to oppose us. Thus, if we are to preserve our sanctuary, this hindrance must be removed posthaste."
 WAR_the_last_meeting:0 "The Last Meeting"
 WAR_the_last_meeting_desc:0 "As the internal situation stabilizes, CAMO's leaders have decided to reconvene to determine their next steps. With the loss of their common enemy, many of the factions have begun to squabble amongst themselves, straining CAMO's cohesion. Amidst the infighting and debates, only one thing remains certain: this meeting will determine whose vision will shape the nation's future."
 
 ## Zaniiaton Tree ##
 WAR_zaniiaton_prevails:0 "Zaniiaton Prevails"
 WAR_zaniiaton_prevails_desc:0 "Following CAMO's final meeting, Zaniiaton and the upstart WCP have managed to scrape their way to the top in the ensuing power struggle.

The WRL now stands at the helm, ready to usher in a new era of freedom and democracy for the people of Warzena."
 WAR_first_parliament:0 "The First Parliament"
 WAR_first_parliament_desc:0 "Warzena has never had a strong democratic tradition, as any representation its monarchs offered was token at best. If we are to truly empower the people, we must provide them with an appropriate institution. Although it may not be easy, establishing a proper representative body will be a huge step in building a true democratic spirit."
 WAR_legitimizing_the_republic:0 "Legitimizing the Republic"
 WAR_legitimizing_the_republic_desc:0 "With the end of the monarchy, our diplomatic standing is tenuous at best and we are seen as little more than upstart usurpers. If we are to successfully navigate the treachery of foreign diplomacy, we must secure foreign recognition for our new government."
 WAR_preserving_the_republic:0 "Preserving the Republic"
 WAR_preserving_the_republic_desc:0 "Although we have managed to deal with most opposition, our position is not secure yet. After all, democracy is a concept quite alien for most Warzenans. Therefore, if our republic is to last, we must ensure that the people come to cherish it as much as we do."
 WAR_king_future:0 "The Past King's Future"
 WAR_king_future_desc:0 "During the tumultuous first months following CAMO's initial coup, king Barekzamal VII and his family were captured and placed under house arrest.

 WAR_matter_of_hippos:0 "The Matter of Foreign Aid"
 WAR_matter_of_hippos_desc:0 "In recent years, the hippogriffs have provided us with invaluable support, both material and otherwise. However, with the recent political upheaval, the status of this aid has come into question. It is high time that we settled this matter once and for all, so that we may confidently look to the future."
 WAR_dreams_of_zonicia:0 "Dreams of a United Zonicia"
 WAR_dreams_of_zonicia_desc:0 "For nearly 200 years, Zinuzel Zidalid's vision of a united Zonicia has remained unfulfilled, seemingly left behind to rot away in the past. But we have not forgotten, for Zidalid's spirit still burns brightly within us! We are the inheritors of his will, and we will ensure that the dream of a unified Zonicia finally becomes a reality!"
 WAR_the_new_coalition:0 "The New Coalition"
 WAR_the_new_coalition_desc:0 "With CAMO gone, many of its more radical elements have become increasingly concerning to our government. To ensure that we keep our mandate, we must ally ourselves with the more moderate members of the political extremes and push out their radical peers."
 WAR_dispel_the_shadow:0 "Dispel the Shadow"
 WAR_dispel_the_shadow_desc:0 "Although he has lain dead for several years now, the Storm King's haunting presence still looms over our people, creating a sense of general unease that permeates the nation. If we are to build a better future, we must cast off this lingering ghost and reinvigorate our people's spirits."
 WAR_fund_public_education:0 "Fund Public Education"
 WAR_fund_public_education_desc:0 "A democracy is only as strong as its people and wisdom is the greatest of strengths the people can have. Therefore, it is only sensible that we create an extensive public education system to ensure that our populace is able to uphold the institutions of our republic."
 WAR_expand_zamivgazal_uni:0 "Expand the University of Zamivgazal"
 WAR_expand_zamivgazal_uni_desc:0 "The nation's oldest institution of tertiary education, the University of Zamivgazal has fallen on hard times as of late, suffering from inadequate supply and staff shortages. We must address these issues if we are to provide the foundation needed to cultivate a new generation of trailblazing thinkers and innovators."
 WAR_support_scientific_institutes:0 "Support Scientific Institutes"
 WAR_support_scientific_institutes_desc:0 "We must put our best and brightest to good use if we are to remain on the cutting edge of research. The most optimal way of achieving this is by investing in new research institutes to ensure that they have the resources needed to survive their early growing pains and show results down the line."
 WAR_economic_recovery_plan:0 "Economic Recovery Plan"
 WAR_economic_recovery_plan_desc:0 "Warzena's economy was already crumbling before the Storm King came; he was simply the nail in the coffin. Economic matters were too contentious to discuss in the days of CAMO rule, but now, with a unified mandate in parliament behind us, we can begin to draft a proper economic policy that will bring the nation out of its stupor."
 WAR_strengthen_our_forts:0 "Strengthen Our Fortifications"
 WAR_strengthen_our_forts_desc:0 "Subject to years of neglect and decay, the current state of Warzena's static defenses can be described as pitiful, at best. If we are to defend the core of our nation from enemy assault, we must strengthen and expand our defensive line to ensure that no enemy takes even an inch of our land."
 WAR_expand_military_rd:0 "Expand Military R&D"
 WAR_expand_military_rd_desc:0 "In this age of industrialized warfare, a nation's innovative capability is just as vital as its logistics infrastructure. By integrating our scientific potential into the military-industrial complex, we can ensure that our armed forces possess as much of a technological and tactical advantage as possible."
 WAR_a_pragmatic_ally:0 "A Pragmatic Ally"
 WAR_a_pragmatic_ally_desc:0 "While relations between our nations have certainly cooled following the abolition of the monarchy, Hippogriffia still remains of great importance to us. With their advanced technology and capable military, it is crucial that we maintain friendly relations so that our republic may yet live to see another day."
 WAR_subsidize_entrepreneurs:0 "Subsidize Entrepreneurs"
 WAR_subsidize_entrepreneurs_desc:0 "Although new factories are being built on a regular basis, it is simply not enough to support the nation. By offering support to enterprising businesszebras, we can greatly increase our industrial output while also providing additional employment and more goods for both domestic and foreign markets."
 WAR_boost_military_production:0 "Boost Military Production"
 WAR_boost_military_production_desc:0 "At present, our military's greatest weakness is a crippling lack of supply, with shortages in materiel and vital support equipment. We must increase the scale of our manufacturing capabilities to ensure that our forces are well-equipped and ready to face any threat to our republic."
 WAR_the_looming_threat:0 "The Looming Threat"
 WAR_the_looming_threat_desc:0 "Initially nothing more than an infrequent nuisance and the stuff of old mares' tales, it has become abundantly clear in recent years that the neighboring Chiropterrans are a far more potent danger than we presumed. We must ready ourselves to face them if, nay when, they decide to strike."
 WAR_head_house_towns:0 "A Head House in Every Town"
 WAR_head_house_towns_desc:0 "If we are to bring Warzena into the modern age, we must create a means of quickly ferrying people, goods, and troops around the country. Creating an extensive railway network is the most cost-effective method to achieve this while thoroughly interconnecting our cities and the back-country in between."
 WAR_the_postwar_order:0 "The Postwar Order"
 WAR_the_postwar_order_desc:0 "Now that peace has returned to North Zebrica, we must assess the situation and decide our next steps. Undoubtedly, the foremost priority is to deal with the recently acquired lands and ensure their peaceful integration into the republic. Only then we can finally turn our attention towards loftier ambitions."
 WAR_tobuck_accord:0 "The Tobuck Accord"
 WAR_tobuck_accord_desc:0 "With the defeat of Chiropterra, the issue of Tobuck has once again become a point of contention between us and Zarantia. However, as we have little interest in the city of Tobuck itself, it may be possible to quietly resolve the matter. By working with the Zarantians, we can reach an agreement that leaves both sides satisfied."
 WAR_negotiate_for_zumidia:0 "Negotiate For Zumidia"
 WAR_negotiate_for_zumidia_desc:0 "The first step in achieving our dream of a united Zonicia is to reunite with our brethren in Zumidia. Currently held by Hippogriffia, a nation whose military greatly outshines our own, using force is not an option. Instead, we will approach them diplomatically and inquire an appropriate price. It may hurt initially, but it is a sacrifice we are willing to make."
 WAR_southern_forts:0 "Southern Fortifications"
 WAR_southern_forts_desc:0 "With the integration of the lands acquired from Chiropterra nearly complete, our next priority is to bolster the region's defenses. Alongside granting enhanced protection from outisde attackers, it also allows us to exert better control over the area and deter those who might take issue with our continued presence there."
 WAR_integrate_rail_networks:0 "Integrate the Rail Networks"
 WAR_integrate_rail_networks_desc:0 "Although we have managed to bring new territories into the republic, their infrastructure has remained disconnected from ours. If we are to truly incorporate these regions into our nation, then we must bring together the various systems and lines into one unifying rail network."
 WAR_establish_zumidian_ar:0 "Establish the Zumidian AR"
 WAR_establish_zumidian_ar_desc:0 "With the transfer of Zumidia to our control, we are now one step closer to achieving our dream. In order to properly administer the region, we will establish an autonomous republic, which will allow the Zumidians to be more involved in the democratic process while also serving as a model for future territories. "
 WAR_southern_dev:0 "Encourage Southern Development"
 WAR_southern_dev_desc:0 "After much work, we have finally managed to establish ourselves in the southern provinces and any lingering opposition has begun to fade away.

 WAR_ursagrad_shipyards:0 "Shipyards of Ursagrad"
 WAR_ursagrad_shipyards_desc:0 "A crucial factor in realizing our dream is possessing a fleet capable of fending off the Colthaginians. Thankfully, we have access to an isolated section of the Green Bay; the perfect place to center our naval production. By expanding the dockyards at Ursagrad, we can begin to grow and train our new fleet away from prying eyes."
 WAR_fortify_aurez_hills:0 "Fortify the Aurez Hills"
 WAR_fortify_aurez_hills_desc:0 "In advancing our ambitions, conflict with Colthage seems ever likelier. Therefore, it is imperative that our border is well defended. Zumidia's Aurez Hills serve as an excellent natural barrier and by constructing lines of advanced fortifications, we can augment those defensive capabilities, ensuring that we can repel any enemy assault."
 WAR_support_zumidian_industry:0 "Support Zumidian Industry"
 WAR_support_zumidian_industry_desc:0 "Years of political turmoil and uncertainty have resulted in Zumidia's industrial sector being somewhat lacking in comparison to our own.

 WAR_grand_objective:0 "The Grand Objective"
 WAR_grand_objective_desc:0 "The time has come. We have bolstered our economy, expanded our infrastructure, mustered our forces, and built new ships and aircraft. In order to achieve our dream, we must strike now while we have the best chance at victory. The heart of Zonicia awaits!"
 WAR_neuter_quaggatai:0 "Neuter the Quaggatai"
 WAR_neuter_quaggatai_desc:0 "With most of Zonicia now under our control, a new issue has arisen. The Quaggatai, the scourge of the steppes, still remain on our southern border. Although they are significantly weaker now, who knows what the future may bring. The best option is to strike first and prevent them from being a threat ever again."
 WAR_issue_of_karalpaka:0 "The Issue of Kar-Alpaka"
 WAR_issue_of_karalpaka_desc:0 "The port of Kar-Alpaka and the surrounding hinterland lie at the easternmost edges of Zonicia. Part of Coltva since time immemorial, the region was seized by the llamas as Colthage suffered from instability. We must demand the return of Kar-Alpaka from its occupiers and bring its people under our rightful rule."
 WAR_integrate_central_zonicia:0 "Integrate Central Zonicia"
 WAR_integrate_central_zonicia_desc:0 "Incorporating the Zonician heartlands into the republic will be a daunting task, but one that will be extremely fruitful. Ensuring that the great cities of Colthage and Hippone follow our mandate will give us great legitimacy in pursuing the Zonician dream."
 WAR_panzonician_railroad:0 "The Pan-Zonician Railroad"
 WAR_panzonician_railroad_desc:0 "If we are to call ourselves the unifiers of Zonicia, we must be able to bring together this vast land. In order to achieve this, we will construct a grand railway spanning the nation, connecting our greatest cities with each other and bringing our people together like never before."
 WAR_eastern_provinces:0 "The Eastern Provinces"
 WAR_eastern_provinces_desc:0 "Located at the edges of Zonicia, Coltva and Coltdar have always been rather distinct. Integrating them into a pan-Zonician state will certainly prove challenging, especially with their history of regionalism. By granting them the autonomy offered to Zumidia, we may yet prevail in bringing our eastern cousins into the fold."
 WAR_realize_zidalids_vision:0 "Realize Zidalid's Vision"
 WAR_realize_zidalids_vision_desc:0 "After years of struggle, sacrifice, and stubborn persistence, we have done it. The dream of generations has finally been brought to fruition as all Zonicia now stands united, just as Zinuzel Zidalid first envisioned nearly 200 years ago.\n\nGlory to the Republic! Glory to Zonicia!"

 WAR_shimzel_triumphs_desc:0 "In the wake of CAMO's collapse, Bennoam Shimzel and his HSNP have managed to eke out a victory amidst the chaos. Using a combination of fear and diplomacy, they were able to successfully outmaneuver their competition. With this first triumph, the dream of Hazrumenia is now one step closer to fruition."

 ## Great Rebuilding Tree
 WAR_great_rebuilding:0 "The Great Rebuilding"
 WAR_great_rebuilding_desc:0 "Now that our government has stabilised, we must turn our efforts to our devastated and outdated economy. The Great Rebuilding will be Warzena's rise from the ashes. The road will be long and hard, but the grandest temples are built one stone at a time."
 WAR_worship_hippogriff_hooves:0 "Work With The Hippogriffs"
 WAR_worship_hippogriff_hooves_desc:0 "Intervention from Hippogriffia has been instrumental in keeping our realm intact. Further Hippogriff involvement would greatly hasten our modernisation efforts. Though, their influence in our country would increase considerably."
 WAR_own_industry:0 "Standing On Our Own"
 WAR_own_industry_desc:0 "We are forever grateful to our friends in Hippogriffia, but if we want to reach our true potential, then our people must stand on their own four hooves. We need more domestic production, to give them work and income. Only that way can Warzena recover."
 WAR_increase_mining:0 "Open Up Mining"
 WAR_increase_mining_desc:0 "There is a wealth of untapped minerals laying right beneath our hooves. Utilising Hippogriff expertise and logistics, we could expand our mining operations throughout the lowlands, nearly doubling our current output."
 WAR_synthetic_stuff:0 "Synthetic Resources"

 WAR_sever_economic_ties:0 "Sever Economic Ties"
 WAR_sever_economic_ties_desc:0 "The time has come to end the foreign aid programmes. They brought a great deal of good, but they were never long-term solutions. It will take more work, but by developing our domestic industrial sector, we can mitigate foreign influence in our economy."
 WAR_knicknacks_and_medicine:0 "Shoes, Medicine, And Candy"
 WAR_knicknacks_and_medicine_desc:0 "We have enormous stockpiles of everyday goods, like shoes, work clothing, medicine, and sugar, in Zamivgazal. Perhaps if we distributed these throughout our more poverty-stricken regions, the people would see that we have their best interests at heart."
 WAR_auction_our_souls:0 "Resource Rights For Technology"
 WAR_auction_our_souls_desc:0 "Hippogriffia is willing to provide us with technical knowledge and training in a various scientific fields. In exchange, they want temporary resource extraction charters. This could be an opportunity for us to narrow the scientific gap between our nations."

 WAR_formalize_cooperation_desc:0 "Hippogriffia's extensive aid has earned them a great deal of goodwill from our people, many already see them as our protectors, or even allies. Perhaps, since their economic interests align with ours, it's time to take steps towards making this a reality."
 WAR_use_radar:0 "Peering Through The Aether"

 WAR_modern_rifles:0 "The Modern Rifle"
 WAR_modern_rifles_desc:0 "Infantry are the backbone of any military, and the rifle is the main tool of infantry. Our muskets and breech-loaders simply will not cut it in modern warfare. Thankfully, our procurement officers have found gunsmiths capable of producing reliable bolt-action rifles. We should offer them contracts."
 WAR_tax_the_corporations:0 "Tax The Corporations"
 WAR_tax_the_corporations_desc:0 "The Great Rebuilding initiatives have been spearheaded by foreign investors and businesses, their tax breaks allowed them to build strong enterprises that expanded our industry. Now that growth has stabilised, it is time to implement a more appropriate tax policy."

 WAR_cowards_no_longer_desc:0 "When the Storm King attacked, we tried to fight back, but our fear was too strong and we cowered like chickens before his approaching armada.

 WAR_traitors_and_lunatics:0 "Traitors And Lunatics"
 WAR_traitors_and_lunatics_desc:0 "There is no doubt that the greatest threat Warzena currently faces is the one posed by the brooding denizens of Chiropterra. Launching raids into our frontier since time immemorial, they have since grown bolder and more frenzied, yet simultaneously even more secretive. We must prepare to defend our nation in case the bats decide to do something beyond a simple raid."
 WAR_southern_bulwark:0 "The Southern Bulwark"
 WAR_southern_bulwark_desc:0 "Although the Zumidian mandate covers our northern flank, the south lies concerningly exposed. With threats mounting from the Chiropterran mountains, it has become imperative that we shore up our defenses to thwart any invasions that seek to end our sovereignty."
 WAR_refit_defenses:0 "Refit Our Defenses"
 WAR_refit_defenses_desc:0 "Prior Warzenan kings had built several rudimentary defensive structures across the country, but they have since fallen into disarray and the few that are still functional would be woefully incapable of impeding an enemy advance. It is crucial that we upgrade our old defenses, so that they can face the fury of modern warfare."
 WAR_reach_out_to_zarantia:0 "Reach Out To The Zarantians"
 WAR_reach_out_to_zarantia_desc:0 "Warzena's current standing with Zarantia can be described as tenuous at best, as the Warzenans and Imazeebs have butted heads several times during the past century. However, the existential threat posed by Chiropterra has deemed it necessary to cast aside our old animosities in favor of cooperation, so that both nations can be free."
 WAR_tobuck_resistance:0 "The Tobuckian Resistance"
 WAR_tobuck_resistance_desc:0 "Although Tobuck was never particularly fond of our rule, they despise their current occupiers even more.

 WAR_fortify_menuch:0 "Fortify The Menuch"
 WAR_fortify_menuch_desc:0 "The Menuch, lifeblood of Warzena, is one of the nation's most strategically vital resources.

 WAR_zumidian_contacts:0 "Zumidian Contacts"
 WAR_zumidian_contacts_desc:0 "As fellow Zonicians, Warzena has always had amiable relations with the Zumidians to the north. Now, united against a common enemy, our ties have grown even closer.

 WAR_border_fortifications_desc:0 "Even if we do not have a long history of cooperation, Hippogriffia has nevertheless become one of Warzena's principal allies, thanks in no small part to the aid offered following the Storm King's defeat. It would be wise to maintain these newly forged bonds, as they may prove useful sooner rather than later."
 WAR_tank_project:0 "Deepen Our Bonds"
 WAR_tank_project_desc:0 "With the situation having stabilized and the country returned to relative peace, it is an opportune moment to expand our relationship with the hippogriffs beyond that of simple philanthropy. Closer diplomatic ties would mean expanded access to advanced Hippogriffian technology and military tactics. However, we must be careful, lest Aris lose interest once it feels that its business here is done."

 WAR_propose_an_alliance_desc:0 "As the situation grows ever drearier in North Zebrica, it has become obvious that simple friendly relations will not be enough to protect Warzena from the threats looming on its frontier. A formalized military alliance will be crucial for Warzena's survival in the tumultuous years to come."
 WAR_joint_training_exercises_real:0 "Joint Training Exercises"
 WAR_joint_training_exercises_real_desc:0 "The Hippogriffian armed forces, although not the most elite fighting force in the world, are still leagues beyond anything Warzena's military can offer. A series of joint military exercises will prove invaluable towards improving the capability of our armed forces while also providing the hippogriffs an opportunity to keep their own military sharp."
 WAR_roads_from_seas:0 "Roads From The Sea"
 WAR_roads_from_seas_desc:0 "Along with much of its consumer goods, Warzena imports nearly a quarter of its military equipment from Hippogriffia. Ensuring the safe transport of these goods is of the utmost importance. Fortunately, we can accommodate for any disruptions by refitting our ports to integrate them with the existing Seaquestrian logistic infrastructure network and expanding the capacity of our coastal railroads."
 WAR_matter_of_tobuck:0 "The Spoils Of War"
 WAR_matter_of_tobuck_desc:0 "The defeat of Chiropterra and her allies, although cause for much celebration, has also opened several questions, namely concerning the occupied territories.

 WAR_the_past_avenged_desc:0 "After a millennia of ceaseless raids and terror, the Chiropterran threat has finally been neutered. As the post-victory euphoria swells and recedes, we must put down our arms and build a new peace. And the first step in that process is deciding the fate of the Chiropterrans now living within our borders, to ensure that the horrors of the past are never repeated."
 WAR_trans_warzenan_railway:0 "A Trans-Warzenan Railway"
 WAR_trans_warzenan_railway_desc:0 "Although our heartlands are well connected by rail, the same cannot be said for our new acquisitions. Their isolation from our network prevents us from fully integrating them into the realm and could potentially result in supply shortages or worse. As such, the King has proposed the construction of a new railway that would span the entirety of the country and unite our kingdom."
 WAR_old_bonds_reforged:0 "Old Bonds Reforged"
 WAR_old_bonds_reforged_desc:0 "With the cessation of conflict in the region, the King has launched an ambitious diplomatic program, aimed at securing friendly relations with our neighbors. His first objectives are the Zarantians and Maregyptians, whose ties with Warzena are centuries old. If we can rekindle the ancient bonds of friendship, we will be one step closer to a true North Zebrican peace."
 WAR_invest_in_new_provinces:0 "Invest in the New Provinces"
 WAR_invest_in_new_provinces_desc:0 "Following the defeat of Chiropterra, we occupied a significant part of their country. Unsurprisingly, this has quickly become a problem, as our new subjects are very hostile to us and rebuke any attempts at peace or cooperation. If we are to rebuild our new lands and incorporate their denizens, we must make a concerted effort to bridge the gap between our peoples."
 WAR_treaty_of_everlasting_friendship:0 "Treaty of Everlasting Friendship"
 WAR_treaty_of_everlasting_friendship_desc:0 "If recent events have proved anything, it is that the hippogriffs are invaluable allies of Warzena.

Now, our ambassadors will meet with the hippogriffs to sign a historic treaty that will preserve our people's friendship for all eternity!"
 WAR_great_port_again:0 "A Great Port Once More"
 WAR_great_port_again_desc:0 "The port of Miharzehir was once the pride of Warzena and our gate to the world. However, the rule of the false Tobuckian republic and the subsequent Chiropterran occupation have left it as a shadow of its former self. With the restoration of our rightful rule, we must do right by our subjects and restore Miharzehir to its rightful place as our greatest port."
 WAR_a_bright_future:0 "A Bright Future"
 WAR_a_bright_future_desc:0 "After the Storm King devastated Warzena, many believed that there was no hope left, that the country was destined for a future of destitution and misery. But Barekzamal refused to give up and, despite all the challenges hurled at him, he has persevered and now Warzena is thriving like never before. We may have endured great suffering, but our foals will know only of joy."
 WAR_an_eternal_peace:0 "An Eternal Peace"
 WAR_an_eternal_peace_desc:0 "A few years ago, North Zebrica was a powderkeg, ready to blow from the tiniest spark. And it did. But from the ashes of that explosion, a new peace has blossomed. Diplomats from across the region have gathered in Zamivgazal to construct a new order, devoid of pain and bloodshed. We will ensure that the next generation never has to pick up arms, nor perish in some wretched trench far from home."
 WAR_a_new_day:0 "A New Day"
 WAR_a_new_day_desc:0 "If you told someone a decade ago that Warzena would be a shining beacon of affluence, they would've laughed or denied it. And yet, it's the truth. Now, in this age of unprecedented peace and prosperity, Warzena is preparing to thank the zebra who worked so tirelessly for it, King Barekzamal. But before he can join the festivities, there's someone he needs to talk to first."

 WAR_resistance_funds:0 "Fund The Resistance"

 WAR_exiled_soldiers_desc:0 "Every day, more and more of our valiant soldiers are escaping the occupation to join the government in exile.

 WAR_exiled_generals:0 "Exiled Officers"
 WAR_exiled_generals_desc:0 "Now that our military needs have changed, we have many exiled officers with little to do. Our allied general staff could make good use of them in their administration, which would also display the continued cooperation between our governments."

 WAR_backbone_of_army:0 "The Backbone of the Army"
 WAR_backbone_of_army_desc:0 "The army, the largest component of the military and the primary defender of the nation, is currently hindered by a crippling crutch. The majority of the weapons our troops have access to are outdated and barely functioning, at best.

 WAR_backbone_of_navy:0 "The Backbone of the Navy"
 WAR_backbone_of_navy_desc:0 "Although not as powerful as it once was, the Warzenan Navy is still the guardian of our waters, protecting merchants and allowing them to safely engage in trade.

This must be addressed as soon as possible if we wish to continue fielding an effective navy."
 WAR_submarine_construction:0 "Undersea Blockade"
 WAR_submarine_construction_desc:0 "As technology advances and naval warfare evolves, it has become more apparent than ever that submarines are a crucial lynchpin of modern marine combat.

 WAR_more_dockyards:0 "Increase Naval Output"
 WAR_more_dockyards_desc:0 "Although we have managed to improve the quality of our navy in recent years, those efforts will all be in vain if we have no means of actually building new models and retrofitting obsolete ones.

 WAR_CAS_experiment:0 "Experiment with CAS"

 WAR_first_battleships_desc:0 "With the revitalization of our military, many have begun to wonder if it is time to develop our navy into a true high seas fleet by building a flotilla of capital ships.

 WAR_backbone_of_airforce:0 "The Backbone of the Airforce"
 WAR_backbone_of_airforce_desc:0 "Not as deep-rooted as the army or the navy, our airforce is token at best, and would barely be capable of guarding our skies. We must promote the development of new fighter plane models so that our air force may more capably defend the nation from aerial assault."
 WAR_doctrinal_advancements:0 "Doctrinal Advancements"
 WAR_doctrinal_advancements_desc:0 "Equipment and ponypower are only half the equation for a successful military.

As such, we must pursue the development of solid military doctrines so that our forces will fight at their best."
 WAR_new_artillery:0 "New Artillery Types"

 WAR_rapid_heavy_industry:0 "Rapid Heavy Industry"
 WAR_rapid_heavy_industry_desc:0 "Our current production rates are simply not sufficient enough to deal with the demands of a proper modern military.

 WAR_supporting_army:0 "Supporting the Army"
 WAR_supporting_army_desc:0 "An army can not fight on an empty stomach, nor can soldiers fight without bandages and communication. We must make sure that our troops are always well supplied with the most advanced support equipment available to us."
 WAR_mechanized_spear:0 "Mechanized Spear"
 WAR_mechanized_spear_desc:0 "Mechanized vehicles are an excellent way to augment our military's fighting capabilities, since they are more maneuverable than tanks, but are better defended than normal trucks, and investing in them will prove to be a great boon for our troops."
 WAR_motorizing_logistics:0 "Motorizing Logistics"
 WAR_motorizing_logistics_desc:0 "Logistics are crucial for guaranteeing the success of our army, and we can never allow them to fall behind.

 WAR_tank_experiment:0 "The Tank Experiment"
 WAR_tank_experiment_desc:0 "Although not particularly viable for us, it may still be prudent to dedicate some resources into tank research. These armored vehicles are perfect for fending off enemy attacks, especially if they can not pierce them, which is highly useful for our small army."
 WAR_seize_trains:0 "Seize Trains"
 WAR_seize_trains_desc:0 "Trains are critical for ensuring the smooth flow of material to the front, and it is apparent that our production levels are falling short of demand. As messy as it may be, it is necessary for us to seize some civilian trains in order to bolster our supply network."

 WAR_true_bombers_desc:0 "While we have worked to keep our fighter models up to date, the same can not be said for our bombers, which, in their current state, could be considered experimental, at best.

The fallout of the Storm King's invasion has served to further stir up the already volatile political climate, as discontent with the ruling system has grown to levels heretofore unheard of and more people are becoming disillusioned with the current state of affairs, swelling CAMO's ranks and bolstering the organization's support network."

 warzena.2.t:0 "A Nation Paralyzed"
 warzena.2.d:0 "The last 200 years have not been kind to Warzena.\n\nAlthough its liberation from the Quaggatai seemed to promise a return to its ancient status quo of isolation and prosperity, fate had other plans for the little kingdom. With the disappearance of the trade route that had run through it, the economy was left crippled and any attempts at reforms were only mildly successful, at best. Meanwhile, the Imazeeb, infuriated by taxes imposed on goods passing through Warzenan ports, took the opportunity to seize the port of Tobuck for themselves, dealing another hefty blow to the economy. During the latter half of the 10th century, the nation languished under a string of negligent and incompetent kings, whose advisors only sought to enrich themselves. This caused anti-monarchist sentiment to fester, as calls for reform were ignored, and its proponents penalized, culminating in the formation of the Coalition of Anti-Monarchy Organizations, or CAMO for short, in the late 970s.\n\nWhen Zamaliahon XVI came to the throne, it seemed that things were finally looking up for Warzena. Under his leadership, the economy's decline began to slow, while new industries began to take root. Many began to wonder if Warzena would finally be able to get back on its legs. Unfortunately, they wouldn't get to find out as, in 1005, the Storm King attacked. His vast armada obliterated the kingdom's meager defenses, and soon, he had seized control of the country. The Second Temple was stripped of its valuables and the structure destroyed afterwards. The king was killed during a raid on the Royal Palace, seemingly snuffing out the country's last hope.\n\nThe conqueror would be slain only a few months later at the fateful battle of Ain Trotgourait, liberating the countless peoples that he had subjugated. But the country was now in ruins. Barekzamal VII, the late king's brother, was never meant to rule, and his inexperience has made the nation's problems all the more glaring. The economy is clinging on to life with Hippogriffian aid, but no one knows how long it can last like this. Zamivgazal lies in ruins, along with many parts of the countryside, and national morale is at an all-time low. All the while, CAMO has grown more popular than ever, as countless commoners flock to their cause, which promises a solution to the country's woes. Either way, it would take a miracle to heal this broken nation, and many are unsure if it can be done."

 warzena.3.t:0 "The Road Ahead"
 warzena.3.d:0 "The country is currently plagued by countless maladies, ranging from widespread economic downturn to local food shortages. The nation's cities are littered with rubble and crowded with the destitute, while the countryside is marred by busted roads and fields left fallow.\n\nIn order to alleviate this, the King's advisors have proposed a series of measures that would promote general recovery, with an emphasis on restoring the nation's urban centers and encouraging industrial development. Some in the court raised concerns about the proposal being too focused on the cities, and too neglectful of rural areas. After some heated debate, it was eventually passed to the King, who just barely managed to convince the dissenters that revitalizing the industrial sector was critical for long-term recovery, but made sure to incorporate extra provisions for rural recovery nonetheless.\n\nSimultaneously, CAMO's leaders have come up with a plan of their own to help reverse the nation's plight. Their efforts are on a smaller scale than anything the King could do, but their dedication is all that matters. Their main focus is the revitalization of their supporter base in the countryside, where CAMO members have been sent to assist in the reparation of local infrastructure and promote the replanting of fields so that food can make its way towards their urban allies. Although the plan is somewhat crude, with some more ambitious elements having been cut due to compromise, the organization's leaders are able to agree on it, and it will hopefully serve them well in garnering support for their cause.\n\nWith both plans being put into effect, ultimately, only one can truly capture the attention of the nation. It soon becomes clear that the more influential of the two was..."
 warzena.3.a:0 "...the Royal Court's recovery measures."
 warzena.3.b:0 "...CAMO's grassroots efforts."
 warzena.4.t:0 "The Challenges That Await Us"
 warzena.4.d:0 "Reversing the nation's fortunes is going to be by no means easy. It will be an uphill battle from start to finish, something both the King and CAMO are quite aware of.\n\nTo smooth over the process of recovery, the Royal Court has suggested passing further economic reforms in order to rejuvenate the economy. More specifically, their proposal calls for investments into entrepreneurial ventures in order to stimulate the economy with new jobs and increased production. The King also managed to introduce a stipulation for providing money to those that were hit hardest, such as laborers and artisans, so that they can contribute to the economy, but also to quell the growing tide of unrest by placating the people.\n\nCAMO's efforts are much more focused, involving a series of rallies in order to improve morale, as well as gatherings where commoners can mingle and forge strong bonds of community in order to overcome the lingering trauma from 1005. Meanwhile, CAMO's wealthier members will use their connections to sympathetic elites, as well as their own coffers, to provide for those suffering the most so that they can hopefully make their way out of poverty and achieve a comfortable standard of living.\n\nThe times ahead are challenging, but hard work is always rewarded, and in the end..."
 warzena.4.a:0 "...the royal stimulus is successful."
 warzena.4.b:0 "...CAMO's cooperation pulls through."
 warzena.5.t:0 "Bandaging The Wounds"
 warzena.5.d:0 "As is well known to every Warzenan, the economy is in a dire state, with thousands left without work or access to basic necessities. Hippogriffian aid is providing a vital lifeline, but it isn't universally well-received, despite the empirical benefits.\n\nThe Royal Court, and the King in particular, hope to reach out to the hippogriffs in order to secure more aid. Although it carries the risk of rejection, the King is confident that they can win over the hippogriffs and secure more much-needed construction materials and advisors.\n\nCAMO hopes to lessen the nation's reliance on the hippogriffs, believing it to be an unnecessary crutch. The head of the Warzenan Republican League, Itthozamal Ankeper, although not an anti-hippogriff himself, does believe that reducing the nation's reliance on them as early as possible is crucial towards a proper economic recovery and securing the future health of the economy. To that end, he has proposed a series of investment and reconstruction efforts in order to ease local economies and restore certain parts of the country to pre-Storm King productivity, which will be achieved by means of the WRL's, and his personal, connections to more liberal entrepreneurs in the country.\n\nAfter just a few weeks, the economy has shown signs of recovery, thanks in large part to..."

The people have been demoralized, and the whole nation is reeling from the trauma.\n\nThe king is not the most popular figure, and many blame him for the country's problems. Even so, he isn't as universally despised as his father or grandfather, and he has enough tact and charm to please most people he meets. Although the Royal Court is somewhat hesitant about it, the king believes that the best way to restore faith in the crown is to mingle with the public and make himself more presentable.\n\nBennoam Shimzel, leader of the ultranationalist Hazrumenian Social Nationalist Party, is well regarded for his oratory skills, despite his more radical tendencies, while his literary background offers a pleasant eloquence to his diction that is unmatched by any of his peers. As such, he intends to host a series of rallies in order to drive support for CAMO's cause, and potentially his own party as well. CAMO's success hinges on popular support, and if they don't secure it as quickly as possible, Warzena may be forced to languish under the yoke of monarchist oppression for another two millennia.\n\nWhoever controls the people's hearts ultimately controls the nation, and by the end..."
 warzena.6.a:0 "...the King has won the people over."
 warzena.6.b:0 "...Shimzel's words capture their spirits."
 warzena.7.t:0 "The Lay Of The Land"
 warzena.7.d:0 "Following an emergency survey, the damage done to the nation has become clear. The nation's cities have been damaged extensively, with large swathes of buildings reduced to rubble, forcing hundreds onto the streets. The nascent industrial sector has been strangled in its crib, while several local institutions have collapsed. Things aren't any better in the countryside, where acres of farmland were either razed or left to fallow, while thousands of farmers were forced to relocate to the cities, overloading the already overburdened relief infrastructure.\n\nThe King hopes to improve the situation by subsidizing farmers and encouraging migration into the country in order to repopulate it so that agricultural production can be increased. The hope is that, by providing housing and food security, he can stabilize the realm and ease dissent.\n\nCAMO's plans are equally as ambitious, with proposals to fund new industrial operations being spearheaded by Zaniiaton, the young leader of the Warzenan Communist Party. By providing additional work for the nation's proletariat, she hopes to improve their quality of life, while also using it as a testing ground for her ideology.\n\nBoth efforts are ambitious, and each side is hedging their bets, but eventually..."
 warzena.7.a:0 "...the King's rural gamble pays off."
 warzena.7.b:0 "...Zaniiaton's industrial initiative bears fruit."
 warzena.8.t:0 "A Crucial Hour"
 warzena.8.d:0 "Ever since 1005, a palpable tension has hung over the nation, so thick you could cut it with a knife. It has simmered over the years, as CAMO worked in secret, preparing to overthrow the king for the good of all Warzenans. Meanwhile, the king himself, who was in way over his head, struggled to keep the peace and institute the reforms the nation so desperately needed. Now, the tension has reached a boiling point, as CAMO readies for the final strike. The king is prepared to do anything necessary to keep his throne and stop the country from falling into chaos.\n\nThe entire nation waits with baited breath, and the fate of the country now rests on a knife's edge."

 warzena.9.a:0 "The throne lives to see another day."
 warzena.10.t:0 "A Hasty Prayer"
 warzena.10.d:0 "Every passing moment drew all of Warzena closer to the nation's future, from its every span of ancient homeland to every denizen to its lone king pacing to and fro in his chamber. The stars and moon had already begun to illuminate the night and all but the busiest of Warzena had retired to sleep, yet still the zebra remained awake.\n\nKing Barekzamal heaved a sigh and gazed over the luminant rooftops of Zamivgazal from his window. Everyzebra had done so much to restore Warzena, and still so much more remained. Though soon, perhaps admittedly even a bit too soon, the nation would be led unto its future with him officially taking the reins. Was this what his late brother felt when he had ascended the throne? All the kings and queens before?\n\nKing Barekzamal smiled. To say all of this was daunting was the understatement of history.\n\nFinally, there was a knock on the door, and Barekzamal called for the invited guests. Quietly, the zebra wondered if he should've adorned something more regal than a modestly fashioned nightgown, but worries soon vanished upon the sight of the small contingent of priests entering and bowing with the barest of ornate robes.\n\n"Good evening, your highness," the head priest spoke, "forgive our lack of proper apparel, we were informed your request was urgent."\n\nThe king returned the courtesy in kind. "Of course, so as long as you all forgive mine."\n\nHe tactfully waited a few moments for their smiles to sink in before bowing his head. "I have summoned all of you here because Warzena will soon embark upon its future, and what lies ahead will undoubtedly determine the destiny of our kingdom. This has troubled me throughout, and I wish, well, to pray, for our future and Warzena's."\n\nOne of the priests spoke nonchalantly. "Hmm, since we're already up, we might as well."\n\nBarekzamal gave a laugh of approval before any of the more stringent priests admonished the remark, moving to begin the impromptu prayer session." #Ardent Custodian

This poses a significant liability for us, and many are reluctant to get further entangled in North Zebrican affairs as it is. On the other claw, however, leaving Warzena defenseless will only be delaying the inevitable, and possibly leave Zumidia's western border completely exposed.

Despite reluctance on the part of the court, the report was broadcast to the nation, causing an air of unease and uncertainty to quickly settle over it as many wondered about the country's future, while those that had disapproved of the hippogriffs from the beginning felt vindicated in their stance."

Despite the euphemistic language, it was clear to everyone that Aris had demanded Warzena become a subjugated vassal state. Now, it seemed, no matter what Warzena chose, it would be stripped of its sovereignty for good.

Encouraged by tax breaks and subsidies, they eagerly moved into the kingdom, which allowed its ailing economy to recover. Following the integration of Warzena into our sphere, the companies have only grown more, but now it seems that there is a bit of friction. Warzena has recently lodged a formal request to impose taxes on the Hippogriffian corporations operating in their country.\n\nThey claim that, with the recovery of their economy, they no longer need to encourage growth via subsidies and must implement sensible tax policies. The corporations have protested in turn, saying that this would harm business and labelling it a betrayal. It is quite impudent of a satellite state to make such demands, and it would be negligent to indulge them. However, Warzena needs to strengthen its economy, and allowing it to properly tax the corporations would allow it to do so. After all, is strengthening our allies not one of our most important priorities?"

While the Warzenans have since enjoyed unprecedented prosperity and privilege within the Hippogriff Hegemony, personal freedoms are nonexistant and independence is a bad joke. Fed a steady diet of propaganda about Warzenan superiority to other zebras by Arisian media, many ironically flocked to the anti-hippogriff CAMO ultranationalists.\n\nThese contradictions were bound to explode. [WAR.GetLeader], though little more than a figurehead, had become a symbol of both harmonist intransigence and hippogriff collaboration. On a hot day in a visit to a small village, three shots rang out.\n\nThe King was only hit once, but it was days before anycreature knew he would survive his wound, and weeks before he was let out of the Arisian hospital he was treated at. When he returned, he no longer recognized Warzena.\n\nOutrage at the would-be assassin and other CAMO ultranationalists was channeled into a ruthless purge. Family members denounced each other for anti-Arisian activity. The syncretist religious movement promoted by the hippogriffs -which saw the Warzenan and hippogriff gods as one and the same- finally gained traction, as service after service was held praying for the King.\n\n[WAR.GetLeader] had been transformed into a symbol of faith and national endurance, but in the interests of his protection he was not to leave the palace again except under heavy hippogriff guard."

The King probably didn't draft it, but whoever did was a zebra after his own heart. He'd have to meet them, whoever they were. Still, there were practical considerations.\n\nCeding Tobuck fully to Warzenan administration was not part of his plan at all; Tobuck was to be exploited more thoroughly, rather than given the special treatment due to Warzenans. And besides, they were mostly ponies: while ceding Tobuck would bolster Warzenan pride, it could dilute their national-racial character in the long run. It might even give them ideas. Ideas of independence.\n\nOn the other claw, the Warzenans could probably handle it cheaper and more easily. Some part of Crack did want to reward this kind of thinking from his favourite subjects.

For his lack of experience as a ruler, he was very aware that there were still those who sought to undermine and treasonously subvert his authority. The members of CAMO had somehow received too many undisclosed details on his future plans for the kingdom, and as a result, were able to present commendable counterproposals. Now with him slated to officially become the head of Warzena and many of their plans rejected, Barekzamal pondered how soon until CAMO or others began considering more extreme measures, if they weren't already.\n\nThe King continued to slowly shift his gaze. His eyes were briefly met by another pair already glancing his way before their owner quickly returned their attention back to the debate between court members. Exactly how much of the royal court were for or against him? How many were indifferent? How many could be swayed and how many would need to be taken care of?\n\nThe royal zebra adjusted to a more comfortable position in his seat. A precedence would have to be made quickly and carefully.

Municipal leaders and police commissioners had arrived and they were expecting him to approve of their door-bucking campaign. Barekzamal gathered himself. He waved the messenger away while he made the slow and tenuous walk to the throne room.\n\nHe cautiously opened the doors with false confidence. The zebras of the room bowed. The king begrudgingly took a seat on the throne, his stomach turning at what was to come. Intrusive thoughts unfolded in his mind as he contemplated the situation. They had been on the brink once before. Since then, they have worked tirelessly to cure their blighted kingdom. The bleak sacrifices made in the past led them to this point. If he called the raids off, it might cascade and force them back to the edge. There was no option other than to bloody the hooves of the monarchy once more.\n\nHe delivered his decision to the small crowd.

The aroma of freshly cooking foods permeated the atmosphere, deliciously blending the scents of individual dishes into the fervent bouquet of a grandiose feast. Exuberant foals galloped in play through the lavishly decorated streets and weaved through the crowds making their way closer and closer to the capital's center. Here gathered the multitudes of Warzena, eager as ever to be present and witnessing true history in the making.\n\nThe only ones who looked less than pleased were the many guards patrolling the streets and stationed throughout the King's domicile, though if asked why, the general consensus would be because they weren't off-duty to enjoy the celebrations.\n\nAll the clamor in the central square fell into hushes and prayers at the sight of Warzena's highest priest stepping out onto the royal balcony. She soon beckoned forth and the boisterous rhythm of the royal orchestra rang out to thundering drums. With a last holy gesture, she stepped aside, and from behind stepped forth their official ruler.\n\nKing Barekzamal VII lifted a hoof and waved with a smile towards the crowd below unbridled in celebration.

In particular, the leaders of CAMO's more extreme factions have apparently become more aggressive, having been freed of the restraint of their moderate counterparts. On the one hoof, this lack of coordination is useful in preventing these elements from being able to front an effective opposition to our authority. On the other hoof however, it has made them much more cautious, which, combined with the aforementioned aggression, has made them a particularly painful thorn in our side.\n\nThe most active of the radicals are the WCP and the HSNP, the forefront of CAMO's radical left and right wing movements, respectively. Zaniiaton, head of the WCP, was one of the few CAMO members we were completely unable to trail, as she seems to blend into the countryside, like a ghost in the shadows. It seems that she has grown even more discreet, staking out careful, but effective, raids on our posts and towns. If she is not dealt with soon, unrest may begin to grow in the rural regions. Meanwhile, the HSNP's Bennoam Shimzel is a character that we have had no problem tracking, but his connections to officials have kept him safe, while his remaining followers, zealous in their devotion, have always managed to skirt him away to safety when all else failed. Should this continue, Shimzel may yet be able to regain his footing and continue to challenge our rule.\n\nMeanwhile, CAMO's other factions have not entirely disappeared either. Although Itthozamal Ankeper, former head of the WRL, has been dealt with, many of his allies have managed to escape and have since banded with other moderate elements to form the League for a Free Warzena, which has continued to operate in secret. Although not as bellicose as their erstwhile radical allies, the LFW is still a problem that will have to be dealt with, lest all our hard work is undone and our sacrifices made futile."

However, although we have solved many of our nation's old woes, new ones are beginning to crop up. The most prominent is the animosity of...", he paused, trying to find the right words,"... our new subjects. That is why I have summoned you today.

Send in the troops and give them no mercy!"\n\nThis outcry was punctuated by several shocked gasps, hushed murmurs, and even a few nods in agreement. The room devolved into violent bickering, and Barekzamal barely managed to restore order. Facing the stallion, he said, "And why would you suggest such a thing? Should we not treat them as fairly as any subject?" The stallion replied, "Why do they deserve our kindness? They are heartless beasts, every last one of them! They abducted our people, pillaged our homes, destroyed our families. And you want to give them mercy?! I'm sorry, your Majesty, but I can't accept that."\n\nBarekzamal pondered this. Yes, the Chiropterrans hadn't been the most amicable of neighbors. But, to repay that with more malice would be short sighted, and that's not what anyone needed right now. Facing the stallion again, Barekzamal spoke, "You are right. The Chiropterrans have given us much pain over the centuries. But to return with just as much hatred would only make things worse. I feel that, if we want to truly be at peace, we must let go of that hate." Turning back to the court, he spoke, "I propose that we demilitarize the nation, to ease the tension.

Fortunately, they had agreed, and now, he was determined to make this work, especially with the Zarantians, with whom relations were already tense. He had declined to participate in the actual meeting, believing that his presence would create undue pressure on the diplomats. As the last of the attendees settled in, Barekzamal could only wait and hope that it went well.\n\nAfter several excruciating hours, Barekzamal was surprised to see a secretary at the door beckoning him to enter. After making his way to the meeting room, he was suddenly met with cheers and well wishes from the foreign delegations. Taken aback, he was led to a seat, and a young Warzenan ambassador summarized the meeting's results to him. What she told him made him happier than he could ever imagine. Not only had his diplomats been able to reach a rapport with the delegations, but they had also managed to secure several lucrative international trading agreements and, to top it off, official treatices of non-aggression!

She barely had a chance to speak before being met by his hostility, as the elder proceeded to steadily work his way through a truly splendid catalogue of insults, where 'old hag' had been only the start, but Gerzanit stood her ground with great calm and patience. She eventually managed to defuse the situation by explaining that they were there in a gesture of good faith. Her words alone had maybe not had too much of an impact, but the crates of food, clothing, fuel, and tools, as well as a large collection of toys for the children, had helped a lot. It had, however, taken Gerzanit dismissing her soldiers as a sign of trust to make the curmudgeonly old thestral listen.\n\nOnce that was sorted, she directed the rest of the mission to begin distributing goods to the group, who were pleased by the treats the mission had brought. The sound of lively chatter drew out the rest of the residents, who had hidden before the mission arrived. An earth pony filly, who had noticed the toys earlier, timidly approached the stallion passing them out, and pointed to a small plush doll.\n\n"C-c-could I-i have that one?

The whole view is rather idyllic, which makes it all the more unbelievable that a little over five years ago, this place looked like a ghost town. But now the streets, once full of nothing but rubble and despair, are alive with smiles and hope. Never before has Zamivgazal prospered this much, nor its denizens been so happy. And if one were to ask the reason for their joy, no doubt they would say, "Gods praise the King."\n\nEven if Barekzamal himself won't say it, the people are more than happy to laud his reform efforts and shrewd leadership as the primary reasons for Warzena's prosperity and continued survival. Some even call him the greatest king Warzena has ever seen. The nation loves its king, and it seems that the gods do as well. It seems that peaceful moments such as these are due to become just another afternoon in Zamivgazal."

 warzena.43.t:0 "North Zebrican Cooperation Conference"
 warzena.43.d:0 "The chatter and shuffling in the conference hall began to die down as the official starting time approached, while the last few attendees finished trickling in. This conference, one of the largest of its kind to ever be hosted in the country, and possibly the whole region, was the amalgamation of nearly a year of hard work. Gathered in this giant hall near the heart of Zamivgazal, purpose-built for the occasion, were dozens of ambassadors, diplomats, and assorted officials from across North Zebrica. Among them were diplomatic legations from Hippogriffia, Colthage, and Chiropterra, alongside representatives for Zarantia and Zumidia, and even emissaries from the Quaggatai and isolationist Macawia.\n\nDespite their differences, those present were united by one overarching purpose: the creation of a true peace in North Zebrica. For the past decade, the region had been subjected to catastrophe, bloodshed, and tragedy, something everyone present was acutely aware of. The meeting opened with a speech from King Barekzamal himself, thanking everyone for their attendance, and inviting them to let go of their grudges so that they could build a peaceful future together. After the applause died down, the conference commenced, and the hall quickly filled with the sound of deliberation and discussion, which was broken up only by speeches from delegates and breaks for meals and religious ceremonies. Eventually, after nearly three days of debate, the conference ratified a series of treatices that were to serve as the blueprint for a new age of peace and harmony in North Zebrica.\n\nAfterwards, the king delivered his concluding speech, lauding everyone for their efforts and expressing his enthusiasm for the future, which was met with raucous applause. It was followed up with an official ceremony that was broadcast across regional radio, and a lavish banquet adorned with countless local delicacies. With the conference's formal conclusion, the attendees departed with a sense of accomplishment and joy, and an air of good feelings remained over the city for weeks."
 warzena.43.a:0 "Our neighbors are wonderful."
 warzena.44.t:0 "Good Morning Brother"
 warzena.44.d:0 "The sun was just starting to peek over the horizon as Barekzamal made his way through the cemetery grounds. For the past few years the place had been overgrown and decrepit, but the groundskeepers, per his request, were able to salvage it after a week of hard work. As he approached his destination, Barekzamal took in the tranquil atmosphere and the beauty of the olive tree growing above the modest obelisk that he had arrived at. He carefully set down the offerings and other objects at its base and, after a quick prayer, looked up to properly face it. His eyes were drawn not to the epitaph inscribed into its marble surface, but to the name of the one it was commemorating: Zamaliahon, the Sixteenth of His Name. His late brother.\n\n"It's been a while since we last spoke, hasn't it. I've been busy lately, so I haven't had much time to spare. We hosted an international conference here recently, it was remarkable! A success beyond my wildest dreams. With this, I believe that we are one step closer to making true peace a reality. And of course, you'll be happy to hear that things are going just as well domestically. The people are thriving, poverty is basically gone, and the economy is booming. The streets are more alive than I ever remember them being. Ah, but I'm sure you don't want to hear the same old spiel again. The real reason I came here was a little more personal."\n\nBarekzamal took a breath before exclaiming, "We're having another child! Ummazanit actually found out a few months ago, but she figured telling you early would be bad luck or something. But of course, you're the first one I've told. If it's a son, we're planning to name him after you. I hope you'll like that. Regardless, we're both very happy."\n\nBarekzamal then paused, seemingly deep in thought, before beginning again, "I really do wish you were here to see all this. It's been very difficult without you, and everyday I find myself wondering how things would've happened if I hadn't lost you. How they should've happened."\n\nBarekzamal stopped to catch his breath, his voice shaky and his eyes tearing up. After a brief second, he managed to push through, "But there's no use in speculation. I'm still here, and so is the kingdom. It wasn't easy, but I've done my best to honor your legacy. I swear to you brother, I will make you proud. Just keep watching."\n\nWith that, Barekzamal performed the closing rites and bade his brother farewell. Walking towards the rising sun, he felt strangely relieved as a soft smile came upon his face."

 warzena.45.d:0 "#TODO - Pretty much what it says on the tin. Open with discussing the difficulties in arranging the parliament to begin with. There's no dedicated building yet, so they have to meet in the town assembly hall for now. After all those preparations, only half of those who said they would attend actually show up. Nevertheless, Ankeper opens the parliament's first session and what follows is a rather unorganized series of debates, which jump from topic to topic very quickly. Despite the chaos, there is a glimmer of hope as the delegates slowly begin to get more organized.

After a series of debates and various proposals, the MPs boil it down to two options: exile or integration. Both options are weighed, with the former weakening restorationist groups but also being unpopular since the king is a rather sympathetic figure (remember: Warzenans dislike the INSTITUTION of monarchy, not the king himself), while the latter would be more risky but would look good from a PR point of view.

Otherwise describe how most of the more radical parties either wither away or align in coalitions with the WCP and HSNP, which themselves are diminishing in influence and popularity. This has given the URP has a strong grip on parliament, although there are other moderate parties that have become more prominent as the more radical parties decline, including isolationist and pro-capital parties."

Transferring it to Warzena would mean less strain on the Hippogriff military and bureaucracy while also ensuring the best possible treatment for the Zumidians.

While his brother, Zamaliahon, was subject to endless tutoring as the crown prince, Barekzamal spent his days playing with the foals of the nobility, and galloping gleefully through the streets of Zamivgazal. His favourite playmate was Ummazanit Nazlayn, the daughter of a prominent noble. Although she was intended as a future bride for his brother, they were never officially engaged, and she much preferred Barekzamal's company to that of his eccentric brother.\n\nWhen Zamaliahon was made king in 1001, he swiftly leapt into action. He formally renounced any intention of marrying in the near future, leaving Barekzamal and Ummazanit free to get married. The two soon sired their first foal, a colt named Hannizamal. However, since Barekzamal was technically his brother's successor, he did make an effort to educate himself on the basics of statecraft and governance. But there was no rush. After all, they were young, and had their whole lives ahead of them. His brother would eventually find a nice mare and Barekzamal could live the rest of his life in bliss. Unfortunately, the gods had other plans for the young prince, and in 1005, his precious world was turned upside down.\n\nAs the Storm King swept through the kingdom, Barekzamal and his family managed to escape, but his brother didn't, and was slain in the Palace by the invaders. When Barekzamal found out, he was overwhelmed by grief, weeping for hours on end. After the conqueror was slain, Barekzamal returned to Zamivgazal a changed person. He quickly set to work, trying to keep the nation afloat. Although he had some success, for the most part, his policies were ineffective as his inexperience betrayed him. This culminated in the successful CAMO coup of 1007, which saw Barekzamal lose his throne. However, in a show of good grace, the new government allowed him to remain in the country, and even offered him an advisory role. Now, Barekzamal continues to do his best for the people of Warzena, not as their king, but as one of them."

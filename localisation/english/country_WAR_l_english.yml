 ### LEADER DESCRIPTIONS ###
 
 WAR_king_zarizel_ii:0 "King Barekzamal VII"
 WAR_king_zarizel_ii_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 24th of August, 984 in Zamivgazal\n\n§YBiography§!: The second son of Zamaliahon XV, Barekzamal had an idyllic childhood, free of struggle. While his brother, Zamaliahon, was subject to endless tutoring as the crown prince, Barekzamal spent his days playing with the foals of the nobility, and galloping gleefully through the streets of Zamivgazal. His favourite playmate was Ummazanit Nazlayn, the daughter of a prominent noble. Although she was intended as a future bride for his brother, they were never officially engaged, and she much preferred Barekzamal's company to that of his eccentric brother.\n\nWhen Zamaliahon was made king in 1001, he swiftly leapt into action. He formally renounced any intention of marrying in the near future, leaving Barekzamal and Ummazanit free to get married. The two soon sired their first foal, a colt named Hannizamal. However, since Barekzamal was technically his brother's successor, he did make an effort to educate himself on the basics of statecraft and governance. But there was no rush. After all, they were young, and had their whole lives ahead of them. His brother would eventually find a nice mare and Barekzamal could live the rest of his life in bliss. Unfortunately, the gods had other plans for the young prince, and in 1005, his precious world was turned upside down.\n\nAs the Storm King swept through the kingdom, Barekzamal and his family managed to escape, but his brother didn't, and was slain in the Palace by the invaders. When Barekzamal found out, he was overwhelmed by grief, weeping for hours on end. After the conqueror was slain, Barekzamal returned to Zamivgazal a changed person. He quickly set to work, trying to keep the nation afloat. Although he had some success, for the most part, his policies were ineffective as his inexperience betrayed him. Now, he sits uneasy on the throne as the threat of revolt grows. While not as unpopular as his father was, he definitely has his fair share of opposition. The fate of the nation rests on his haunches, and it will take monumental effort on his part to keep it, and his throne, from falling out of his grasp. But Barekzamal is determined to bring Warzena into a brighter future, where he can smile with his family once more."

 WAR_reeling_from_shock:0 "Reeling From The Shock"
 WAR_reeling_from_shock_desc:0 "The Storm King's invasion has left the nation shell-shocked, and many are unsure of where to go. The king is doing his best to keep the peace, but his opposition see it as their time to strike and bring change to this ancient kingdom."
 WAR_road_to_recovery:0 "The Road To Recovery..."
 WAR_road_to_recovery_desc:0 "To say Warzena's situation is bad would be a gross understatement. However, sitting around on our rumps all day complaining won't do anyone any good, and the country must stand up and begin to look towards the future once more."
 WAR_is_not_easy:0 "...Isn't An Easy One"
 WAR_is_not_easy_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, all the romantic bravado in the world isn't enough to hide the monumental challenges that face us as we attempt to rebuild the nation. But, it does work as solid motivation to keep the people going as we struggle for a brighter future."
 WAR_stop_the_bleeding:0 "Stop The Bleeding"
 WAR_stop_the_bleeding_desc:0 "Currently on its last legs and being kept barely afloat by Hippogriffian aid, the economy is in a particularly sorry state. We must take any measures necessary to stop the economy from collapsing outright, even if they're only temporary."
 WAR_the_peoples_hearts:0 "The People's Hearts"
 WAR_the_peoples_hearts_desc:0 "The Warzenan commonfolk have suffered the most from the events of the past few years, and they have been almost completely demoralized. We must temper the people's hearts, to ease the pain of what came before, and to prepare them for what is to follow."
 WAR_assess_the_damage:0 "Assess The Damage"
 WAR_assess_the_damage_desc:0 "Even though the abysmal state of the nation is clear to anyone who looks, the real question is how bad the damage truly is. We must assess the nation to truly understand the harm done and come up with the most effective course of action as quickly as possible."
 WAR_a_crucial_hour:0 "A Crucial Hour"
 WAR_a_crucial_hour_desc:0 "A crucial hour has befallen Warzena: will she stick to a status quo spanning the millennia, or will she start anew in this ever changing world?"
 WAR_faith_in_king:0 "Faith In The King"
 WAR_faith_in_king_desc:0 "It seems that tradition has managed to persevere once more, and all of Warzena now looks towards King Barekzamal to be the king he needs to be, and the leader they believe he can be."
 WAR_a_hasty_prayer:0 "A Hasty Prayer"
 WAR_a_hasty_prayer_desc:0 "Although he has managed to keep his throne, the King has nevertheless become overburdened by stress. Hopefully, the support of the clergy and the gods will prove sufficient to aid him in these trying times."
 WAR_appease_the_rabble:0 "Appease The Rabble"
 WAR_appease_the_rabble_desc:0 "The people are uppity, and a palpable tension hangs in the air. That isn't to say that their qualms are unjustified, as much of the current situation is the result of incompetent leadership. Nevertheless, if we do not assuage them soon, CAMO may be able to regain its waning momentum."
 WAR_emergency_measures:0 "Emergency Measures"
 WAR_emergency_measures_desc:0 "Although we have managed to prevent the country from collapsing outright, the situation is still tenuous at best, and without further measures, may spiral completely out of our control. Even if they are temporary, these policies will ensure that the country can keep its bearings until a more permanent solution is implemented."
 WAR_traitors_among_us:0 "The Traitors Among Us..."
 WAR_traitors_among_us_desc:0 "Although we would like to believe that the royal court can be trusted, we must accept the harsh reality that there are traitors and backstabbers among us, with even the king's closest advisors being potential impostors relaying information to our enemies."
 WAR_all_around_us:0 "...And All Around Us"
 WAR_all_around_us_desc:0 "All across the country, there is a vast network of those opposed to the monarchy, consisting of a myriad of different people, coming from different walks of life. They blend in with the crowds, and are nearly undetectable. But, they are not invincible. If the main agents of dissidence can be tracked down and neutralized, then the beast they built will surely follow."
 WAR_proper_coronation:0 "A Proper Coronation"
 WAR_proper_coronation_desc:0 "After 3 years of devastation and misery, Warzena is finally able to witness the coronation of her king. While he may not have been intended for the throne, it is now his, and it is now up to him to use its powers to guide the country towards a better and brighter future."
 
 ## CAMO Opening ##
 WAR_a_fresh_start:0 "A Fresh Start"
 WAR_a_fresh_start_desc:0 "Millennia of tradition have failed Warzena for too long, and this catastrophe was the final straw. Now, a ragtag band of visionaries is at the helm, ready to lead Warzena in a new direction, and hopefully, to a brighter future."

 ## Great Rebuilding Tree
 WAR_great_rebuilding:0 "The Great Rebuilding"
 WAR_great_rebuilding_desc:0 "Now that our government has stabilised, we must turn our efforts to our devastated and outdated economy. The Great Rebuilding will be Warzena's rise from the ashes. The road will be long and hard, but the grandest temples are built one stone at a time."
 WAR_worship_hippogriff_hooves:0 "Work With The Hippogriffs"
 WAR_worship_hippogriff_hooves_desc:0 "Intervention from Hippogriffia has been instrumental in keeping our realm intact. Further Hippogriff involvement would greatly hasten our modernisation efforts. Though, their influence in our country would increase considerably."
 WAR_own_industry:0 "Standing On Our Own"
 WAR_own_industry_desc:0 "We are forever grateful to our friends in Hippogriffia, but if we want to reach our true potential, then our people must stand on their own four hooves. We need more domestic production, to give them work and income. Only that way can Warzena recover."
 WAR_increase_mining:0 "Open Up Mining"
 WAR_increase_mining_desc:0 "There is a wealth of untapped minerals laying right beneath our hooves. Utilising Hippogriff expertise and logistics, we could expand our mining operations throughout the lowlands, nearly doubling our current output."
 WAR_synthetic_stuff:0 "Synthetic Resources"
 WAR_synthetic_stuff_desc:0 "Fuel is the lifeblood of a modern economy, and essential to a modern military. We lack natural oil, but there are Hippogriff refining companies that could produce enough fuel to keep things running. Perhaps we should offer them a contract?"
 WAR_address_illiteracy:0 "Address Illiteracy"
 WAR_address_illiteracy_desc:0 "Education reform has long been on our agenda. By establishing adult learning centres and expanding the reach of our public schools, we can begin to improve our citizens' literacy and numeracy."
 WAR_address_poverty:0 "Address Poverty"
 WAR_address_poverty_desc:0 "A sizeable amount of our unskilled workers are unemployed. We could prioritise creating entry-level jobs in Rebuilding projects to keep these workers above the poverty line, as well as promoting national unity."
 WAR_sever_economic_ties:0 "Sever Economic Ties"
 WAR_sever_economic_ties_desc:0 "The time has come to end the foreign aid programmes. They brought a great deal of good, but they were never long-term solutions. It will take more work, but by developing our domestic industrial sector, we can mitigate foreign influence in our economy."
 WAR_knicknacks_and_medicine:0 "Shoes, Medicine, And Candy"
 WAR_knicknacks_and_medicine_desc:0 "We have enormous stockpiles of everyday goods, like shoes, work clothing, medicine, and sugar, in Zamivgazal. Perhaps if we distributed these throughout our more poverty-stricken regions, the people would see that we have their best interests at heart."
 WAR_auction_our_souls:0 "Resource Rights For Technology"
 WAR_auction_our_souls_desc:0 "Hippogriffia is willing to provide us with technical knowledge and training in a various scientific fields. In exchange, they want temporary resource extraction charters. This could be an opportunity for us to narrow the scientific gap between our nations."
 WAR_invest_in_radio:0 "Invest In Radio"
 WAR_invest_in_radio_desc:0 "Investing in FM Radio would not only be a boon to our military's cohesion, but would also allow us to easily broadcast information to our rural citizens."
 WAR_industrialize:0 "The Industrialisation Issue"
 WAR_industrialize_desc:0 "Even before the Storm King's wars, our nation was woefully lacking in machinery, instead reliant on cottage industries and outdated factories. Under our new plan, we can restructure our industry to properly utilise machine tools and modern production line methods."
 WAR_new_gun_factories:0 "New Gun Factories"

 WAR_rapid_buildup:0 "Rapid Buildup"

 WAR_formalize_cooperation:0 "Formalise Cooperation"
 WAR_formalize_cooperation_desc:0 "Hippogriffia's extensive aid has earned them a great deal of goodwill from our people, many already see them as our protectors, or even allies. Perhaps, since their economic interests align with ours, it's time to take steps towards making this a reality."
 WAR_use_radar:0 "Peering Through The Aether"
 WAR_use_radar_desc:0 "Long-range detection completely changes the way we look at warfare. Our military minds are insistent on investing in this new technology, as it gives us a way to peer through the fog of war."
 WAR_modern_rifles:0 "The Modern Rifle"
 WAR_modern_rifles_desc:0 "Infantry are the backbone of any military, and the rifle is the main tool of infantry. Our muskets and breech-loaders simply will not cut it in modern warfare. Thankfully, our procurement officers have found gunsmiths capable of producing reliable bolt-action rifles. We should offer them contracts."
 WAR_tax_the_corporations:0 "Tax The Corporations"
 WAR_tax_the_corporations_desc:0 "The Great Rebuilding initiatives have been spearheaded by foreign investors and businesses, their tax breaks allowed them to build strong enterprises that expanded our industry. Now that growth has stabilised, it is time to implement a more appropriate tax policy."
 WAR_roads_and_railroads:0 "Roads And Railroads"
 WAR_roads_and_railroads_desc:0 "Our limited infrastructure has long impeded growth in our towns and rural regions. By expanding our road network and reorganising our Department of Transport, we can increase the interconnectivity of our nation, as well as preparing for future improvements."
 WAR_open_for_business:0 "Open For Business"
 WAR_open_for_business_desc:0 "Now that our infrastructure and industrial methods have been expanded, we can finally tap into the mineral resources in the lowlands. These mines will give us many of the materials we need to maintain a modern military and economy."
 WAR_rebuilding_complete:0 "The Rebuilding Complete"
 WAR_rebuilding_complete_desc:0 "It has been a long and arduous path, but thanks to our efforts, we have taken the rubble that the Storm King left behind and built it into a nation. Now we stand proud, for our children will grow up in a new, modern realm."
 
 ## Royalist Political Tree
 WAR_dealing_with_CAMO:0 "Cleaning The Mess"
 WAR_dealing_with_CAMO_desc:0 "Although the main body of resistance has been dealt with, the agents of discord remain active. Many elements that were kept in check by CAMO leadership have grown bolder and even more radical, which has not aided the situation."
 WAR_find_the_socialists:0 "Purge The Radicals"
 WAR_find_the_socialists_desc:0 "It is imperative that we neutralize the more radical anti-monarchy elements, before they have the chance to cause too much trouble."
 WAR_paramilitary_guerrillas:0 "Paramilitary Guerrillas"
 WAR_paramilitary_guerrillas_desc:0 "Warzena has no shortage of radical elements that are itching to fight the invaders. All they need is some equipment. But caution is necessary, lest they end up taking all the credit."
 WAR_find_the_nonaligned:0 "Flush Out The Remnants"
 WAR_find_the_nonaligned_desc:0 "The remaining leaders of CAMO have gone into hiding, but they cannot escape us forever. They must be hunted down and pacified, to prevent them from reclaiming their lost momentum."

 WAR_find_the_fascists_desc:0 "The traitors are on their last legs, and one final push should be all we need to quell any remaining elements of discontent."
 WAR_strike_a_deal:0 "Strike Up A Deal"

 WAR_salvage_the_economy:0 "Picking Up The Pieces"
 WAR_salvage_the_economy_desc:0 "The economy has suffered blow after blow in the past few years, and is hanging on by a thread. It is high time that we properly addressed it."
 WAR_intelligence_funds:0 "Intelligence Funds"
 WAR_intelligence_funds_desc:0 "If the last decade has made anything clear, it is that the nation's intelligence is in a very sorry state. Caught unawares over and over, it is clear that more resources must be devoted to the nation's intelligence network."
 WAR_the_storm_king_problem:0 "The Elephant In The Room"
 WAR_the_storm_king_problem_desc:0 "Despite our attempts to tiptoe around it, it is blatantly clear that we must face our fears and address the phantom menace that has hung over Warzena since 1005."
 WAR_peace_at_home:0 "Peace at Home..."
 WAR_peace_at_home_desc:0 "In these trying times, we must ensure the nation remains unified and stable, lest we give our enemies an easy opening with which to tear us apart."
 WAR_never_again:0 "Never Again"
 WAR_never_again_desc:0 "The horrors of 1005 have permanently etched themselves into the hearts of every Warzenan, but we are determined to never allow another Storm King to harm us again."
 WAR_ear_on_every_street:0 "An Ear On Every Street"
 WAR_ear_on_every_street_desc:0 "We must expand our intelligence network in order to better protect against any potential threats, from both within and without."
 WAR_more_storm_king:0 "Revive Our Industry"
 WAR_more_storm_king_desc:0 "At the start of the century, Warzena had a small, but growing, industrial sector. That all changed when the Storm King attacked. Now, with the situation back under control, it is time we begin to restore our industry, so it may reach its fullest potential."
 WAR_cowards_no_longer:0 "Cowards No Longer"
 WAR_cowards_no_longer_desc:0 "When the Storm King attacked, we tried to fight back, but our fear was too strong, and we cowered like chickens before his approaching armada. The Warzenan people have changed much since that fateful day, and are now more than willing to face their enemy to the bitter end."
 WAR_full_steam_ahead:0 "Full Steam Ahead"
 WAR_full_steam_ahead_desc:0 "With our industry going into full swing, aspiring entrepreneurs are more willing than ever to launch new ventures and experiment with new services and commodities."
 WAR_guns_and_more_guns:0 "The Question Of The Stolen Artefacts"

 WAR_never_forgive:0 "Never Forgive, Never Forget"
 WAR_never_forgive_desc:0 "Although it will hurt, we must accept the loss of our treasures, and learn to cherish what we have. The people may not like it, but it is the reality we find ourselves in, and we must adapt accordingly."

 WAR_foreign_diplomacy:0 "Analyzing the Situation"
 WAR_foreign_diplomacy_desc:0 "Warzena has spent too much of her history isolating herself from the world, which has not always worked out in our favor. This time, Warzena must go out into the world and gauge her surroundings, so that she may assert her position in the neverending drama of international relations."
 WAR_joint_training_exercises:0 "Threats On All Sides"
 WAR_joint_training_exercises_desc:0 "As we examine the current political climate, it has become abundantly clear that the region has grown more hostile to our interests. Warzena must adapt and prepare to weather the coming storm, lest we are all washed away in the tides of history."
 WAR_peace_abroad:0 "...And Peace Abroad"
 WAR_peace_abroad_desc:0 "In order to ensure our survival, we must reach out towards foreign governments with similar ideals and make every effort to secure friendly relations, so that no harm shall come from beyond our nation's borders."
 WAR_traitors_and_lunatics:0 "Traitors And Lunatics"
 WAR_traitors_and_lunatics_desc:0 "There is no doubt that the greatest threat Warzena currently faces is the one posed by the brooding denizens of Chiropterra. Launching raids into our frontier since time immemorial, they have since grown bolder and more frenzied, yet simultaneously even more secretive. We must prepare to defend our nation in case the bats decide to do something beyond a simple raid."
 WAR_southern_bulwark:0 "The Southern Bulwark"
 WAR_southern_bulwark_desc:0 "Although the Zumidian mandate covers our northern flank, the south lies concerningly exposed. With threats mounting from the Chiropterran mountains, it has become imperative that we shore up our defenses to thwart any invasions that seek to end our sovereignty."
 WAR_refit_defenses:0 "Refit Our Defenses"
 WAR_refit_defenses_desc:0 "Prior Warzenan kings had built several rudimentary defensive structures across the country, but they have since fallen into disarray, and the few that are still functional would be woefully incapable of impeding an enemy advance. It is crucial that we upgrade our old defenses, so that they can face the fury of modern warfare."
 WAR_reach_out_to_zarantia:0 "Reach Out To The Zarantians"
 WAR_reach_out_to_zarantia_desc:0 "Warzena's current standing with Zarantia can be described as tenuous at best, as the Warzenans and Imazeebs have butted heads several times during the past century. However, the existential threat posed by Chiropterra has deemed it necessary to cast aside our old animosities in favor of cooperation, so that both nations can be free."
 WAR_tobuck_resistance:0 "The Tobuckian Resistance"
 WAR_tobuck_resistance_desc:0 "Although Tobuck was never particularly fond of our rule, they despise their current occupiers even more. In order to hamper our enemies' operations, we must aid the local resistance movements in any we can in order to cause as much disruption to the enemy as possible."
 WAR_fortify_menuch:0 "Fortify The Menuch"
 WAR_fortify_menuch_desc:0 "The Menuch, lifeblood of Warzena, is one of the nation's most strategically vital resources. If it were to fall under enemy control, the nation would be left extremely vulnerable. Bolstering its defenses is therefore critical in our efforts to prepare the nation for the eventuality of war."
 WAR_zumidian_contacts:0 "Zumidian Contacts"
 WAR_zumidian_contacts_desc:0 "As fellow Zonicians, Warzena has always had amiable relations with the Zumidians to the north. Now, united against a common enemy, our ties have grown even closer. Using our connections, we should be able to secure the help of several Zumidian groups in order to supplement our armed forces."
 WAR_border_fortifications:0 "Our Friends To The North"
 WAR_border_fortifications_desc:0 "Even if we do not have a long history of cooperation, Hippogriffia has nevertheless become one of Warzena's principal allies, thanks in no small part to the aid offered following the Storm King's defeat. It would be wise to maintain these newly forged bonds, as they may prove useful sooner rather than later."
 WAR_tank_project:0 "Deepen Our Bonds"
 WAR_tank_project_desc:0 "With the situation having stabilized and the country returned to relative peace, it is an opportune moment to expand our relationship with the hippogriffs beyond that of simple philanthropy. Closer diplomatic ties would mean expanded access to advanced Hippogriffian technology and military tactics. However, we must be careful, lest Aris lose interest once it feels that its business here is done."

 WAR_propose_an_alliance_desc:0 "As the situation grows ever drearier in North Zebrica, it has become obvious that simple friendly relations will not be enough to protect Warzena from the threats looming on its frontier. A formalized military alliance will be crucial for Warzena's survival in the tumultuous years to come."
 WAR_joint_training_exercises_real:0 "Joint Training Exercises"
 WAR_joint_training_exercises_real_desc:0 "The Hippogriffian armed forces, although not the most elite fighting force in the world, are still leagues beyond anything Warzena's military can offer. A series of joint military exercises will prove invaluable towards improving the capability of our armed forces while also providing the hippogriffs an opportunity to keep their own military sharp."
 WAR_roads_from_seas:0 "Roads From The Sea"
 WAR_roads_from_seas_desc:0 "Along with much of its consumer goods, Warzena imports nearly a quarter of its military equipment from Hippogriffia. Ensuring the safe transport of these goods is of the utmost importance. Fortunately, we can accommodate for any disruptions by refitting our ports to integrate them with the existing Seaquestrian logistic infrastructure network and expanding the capacity of our coastal railroads."
 WAR_matter_of_tobuck:0 "The Spoils Of War"
 WAR_matter_of_tobuck_desc:0 "The defeat of Chiropterra and her allies, although cause for much celebration, has also opened several questions, namely concerning the occupied territories. We should move to resolve these as quickly as possible, so that any new tensions don't have time to grow and rear their ugly heads."
 WAR_the_past_avenged:0 "The Past Avenged"
 WAR_the_past_avenged_desc:0 "After a millennia of ceaseless raids and terror, the Chiropterran threat has finally been neutered. As the post-victory euphoria swells and recedes, we must put down our arms and build a new peace. And the first step in that process is deciding the fate of the Chiropterrans now living within our borders, to ensure that the horrors of the past are never repeated."
 WAR_trans_warzenan_railway:0 "A Trans-Warzenan Railway"
 WAR_trans_warzenan_railway_desc:0 "Although our heartlands are well connected by rail, the same cannot be said for our new acquisitions. Their isolation from our network prevents us from fully integrating them into the realm, and could potentially result in supply shortages or worse. As such, the King has proposed the construction of a new railway that would span the entirety of the country and unite our kingdom."
 WAR_old_bonds_reforged:0 "Old Bonds Reforged"
 WAR_old_bonds_reforged_desc:0 "With the cessation of conflict in the region, the King has launched an ambitious diplomatic program, aimed at securing friendly relations with our neighbors. His first objectives are the Zarantians and Maregyptians, whose ties with Warzena are centuries old. If we can rekindle the ancient bonds of friendship, we will be one step closer to a true North Zebrican peace."
 WAR_invest_in_new_provinces:0 "Invest in the New Provinces"
 WAR_invest_in_new_provinces_desc:0 "Following the defeat of Chiropterra, we occupied a significant part of their country. Unsurprisingly, this has quickly become a problem, as our new subjects are very hostile to us, and rebuke any attempts at peace or cooperation. If we are to rebuild our new lands and incorporate their denizens, we must make a concerted effort to bridge the gap between our peoples."
 WAR_treaty_of_everlasting_friendship:0 "Treaty of Everlasting Friendship"
 WAR_treaty_of_everlasting_friendship_desc:0 "If recent events have proved anything, it is that the hippogriffs are invaluable allies of Warzena. They have stuck with us through thick and thin, and together, we crafted a new order of harmony and peace in North Zebrica. Now, our ambassadors will meet with the hippogriffs to sign a historic treaty that will preserve our people's friendship for all eternity!"
 WAR_great_port_again:0 "A Great Port Once More"
 WAR_great_port_again_desc:0 "The port of Miharzehir was once the pride of Warzena and our gate to the world. However, the rule of the false Tobuckian republic and the subsequent Chiropterran occupation have left it as a shadow of its former self. With the restoration of our rightful rule, we must do right by our subjects and restore Miharzehir to its rightful place as our greatest port."
 WAR_a_bright_future:0 "A Bright Future"
 WAR_a_bright_future_desc:0 "After the Storm King devastated Warzena, many believed that there was no hope left, that the country was destined for a future of destitution and misery. But Barekzamal refused to give up, and, despite all the challenges hurled at him, he has persevered, and now, Warzena is thriving like never before. We may have endured great suffering, but our foals will know only of joy."
 WAR_an_eternal_peace:0 "An Eternal Peace"
 WAR_an_eternal_peace_desc:0 "A few years ago, North Zebrica was a powderkeg, ready to blow from the tiniest spark. And it did. But from the ashes of that explosion, a new peace has blossomed. Diplomats from across the region have gathered in Zamivgazal to construct a new order, devoid of pain and bloodshed. We will ensure that the next generation never has to pick up arms, nor perish in some wretched trench far from home."

 WAR_a_new_day_desc:0 "If you told someone a decade ago that Warzena would be a shining beacon of affluence, they would've laughed or denied it. And yet, it's the truth. Now, in this age of unprecedented peace and prosperity, Warzena is preparing to thank the zebra who worked so tirelessly for it, King Barekzamal. But before he can join the festivities, there's someone he needs to talk to first."

 WAR_warzenan_military_desc:0 "Thanks in large part to our isolationist past, our military has not seen much improvement since the days of the Quaggatai. As a result, it lags woefully behind the forces of our neighbors. If we are to have a fighting chance in the upcoming struggle, we must invest in our military before it is too late."
 WAR_backbone_of_army:0 "The Backbone of the Army"
 WAR_backbone_of_army_desc:0 "The army, the largest component of the military and the primary defender of the nation, is currently hindered by a crippling crutch. The majority of the weapons our troops have access to are outdated and barely functioning, at best. Arms are the foundation on which a good army is built, and ours must be up to par if we want our army to have any semblance of efficacy."
 WAR_backbone_of_navy:0 "The Backbone of the Navy"
 WAR_backbone_of_navy_desc:0 "Although not as powerful as it once was, the Warzenan Navy is still the guardian of our waters, protecting merchants and allowing them to safely engage in trade. It is crucial that we look into improving our screens, so that our navy may continue to protect our shores."
 WAR_destroyer_construction:0 "Modernize Destroyers"
 WAR_destroyer_construction_desc:0 "For much of our modern history, destroyers have composed the bulk of the Warzenan Navy's tonnage. Even today, they form the majority of our fleet. Unfortunately, we have not been able to devote enough resources to keep them up to snuff, leaving our fleet burdened by obsolete ships. This must be addressed as soon as possible if we wish to continue fielding an effective navy."
 WAR_submarine_construction:0 "Undersea Blockade"
 WAR_submarine_construction_desc:0 "As technology advances and naval warfare evolves, it has become more apparent than ever that submarines are a crucial lynchpin of modern marine combat.

 WAR_more_dockyards:0 "Increase Naval Output"
 WAR_more_dockyards_desc:0 "Although we have managed to improve the quality of our navy in recent years, those efforts will all be in vain if we have no means of actually building new models and retrofitting obsolete ones.

 WAR_mine_warfare:0 "Mine Warfare"
 WAR_mine_warfare_desc:0 "The harsh truth is that our navy stands no chance in conventional open combat. In order to make up for this, we should invest into more furtive methods of securing victory.

 WAR_CAS_experiment:0 "Experiment with CAS"
 WAR_CAS_experiment_desc:0 "While our fighters clear the air of enemy aircraft, we must also actively support our troops fighting on the ground. By developing new aircraft models capable of supporting our army in ground operations, we can greatly increase their chance of victory."
 WAR_tactical_bomber_tests:0 "Testing Tactical Bombers"
 WAR_tactical_bomber_tests_desc:0 "While our air force is capable of fighting on the front itself, it does not currently possess the means to operate behind enemy lines.

 WAR_first_battleships:0 "The First Battleships"
 WAR_first_battleships_desc:0 "With the revitalization of our military, many have begun to wonder if it is time to develop our navy into a true high seas fleet by building a flotilla of capital ships. Although they were seen as impractical and expensive for the longest time, perhaps it is time for us to finally join the other great naval powers of the world with our own battleships."
 WAR_backbone_of_airforce:0 "The Backbone of the Airforce"
 WAR_backbone_of_airforce_desc:0 "Not as deep-rooted as the army or the navy, our airforce is token at best, and would barely be capable of guarding our skies. We must promote the development of new fighter plane models so that our air force may more capably defend the nation from aerial assault."

 WAR_doctrinal_advancements_desc:0 "Equipment and ponypower are only half the equation for a successful military. To field a truly effective fighting force, one must combine quality equipment and well trained troops with ideal doctrine, without which the former are completely useless. As such, we must pursue the development of solid military doctrines so that our forces will fight at their best."
 WAR_new_artillery:0 "New Artillery Types"
 WAR_new_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery has advanced much since the days of simple gunpowder cannons. Unfortunately, our military seems to have slept on this development, and our forces are now desperately lacking in firepower.

 WAR_naval_bombers:0 "Naval Bombers"
 WAR_naval_bombers_desc:0 "With our limited resources, and even more limited fuel reserves, it is clear that we cannot win in conventional naval warfare.

 WAR_rapid_heavy_industry:0 "Rapid Heavy Industry"
 WAR_rapid_heavy_industry_desc:0 "Our current production rates are simply not sufficient enough to deal with the demands of a proper modern military.

 WAR_mechanized_spear:0 "Mechanized Spear"
 WAR_mechanized_spear_desc:0 "Mechanized vehicles are an excellent way to augment our military's fighting capabilities, since they are more maneuverable than tanks, but are better defended than normal trucks, and investing in them will prove to be a great boon for our troops."
 WAR_motorizing_logistics:0 "Motorizing Logistics"
 WAR_motorizing_logistics_desc:0 "Logistics are crucial for guaranteeing the success of our army, and we can never allow them to fall behind. Thus, we must ensure the steady and rapid flow of supplies to the front by employing trucks in supply convoys, as their speed will prove very useful in the rapid delivery of vital supplies."
 WAR_tank_experiment:0 "The Tank Experiment"
 WAR_tank_experiment_desc:0 "Although not particularly viable for us, it may still be prudent to dedicate some resources into tank research. These armored vehicles are perfect for fending off enemy attacks, especially if they can not pierce them, which is highly useful for our small army."
 WAR_seize_trains:0 "Seize Trains"
 WAR_seize_trains_desc:0 "Trains are critical for ensuring the smooth flow of material to the front, and it is apparent that our production levels are falling short of demand. As messy as it may be, it is necessary for us to seize some civilian trains in order to bolster our supply network."
 WAR_army_reborn:0 "The Army Reborn"
 WAR_army_reborn_desc:0 "After years of effort and spending, it has finally paid off. Our army, once one of the worst in North Zebrica, has been able to catch up and establish itself as a true modern military, capable of engaging in today's industrialized warfare."
 WAR_find_crystals:0 "Dowse for Crystals"
 WAR_find_crystals_desc:0 "In recent years, more and more applications for magical crystals have been discovered.

 WAR_true_bombers:0 "Develop True Bombers"
 WAR_true_bombers_desc:0 "While we have worked to keep our fighter models up to date, the same can not be said for our bombers, which, in their current state, could be considered experimental, at best.

The ancient trade route from Maregypt, that had once passed through Warzena to reach the great cities of Zonicia, had been rendered obsolete by the invention of new ships that could travel vast distances by sea. This left Warzena stripped of its economic lifeblood, and the economy soon began to falter. The construction of the Second Temple in the 850s pushed the already unsteady economy to its limits, kickstarting 150 years of economic downturn and stagnation. The situation continued to worsen as succeeding rulers were unable to handle the issue, further exacerbated by the loss of Tobuck in 956.

 warzena.1.a:0 "That's horrible."
 warzena.2.t:0 "A Nation Paralyzed"
 warzena.2.d:0 "The last 200 years have not been kind to Warzena.\n\nAlthough its liberation from the Quaggatai seemed to promise a return to its ancient status quo of isolation and prosperity, fate had other plans for the little kingdom. With the disappearance of the trade route that had run through it, the economy was left crippled and any attempts at reforms were only mildly successful, at best. Meanwhile, the Imazeeb, infuriated by taxes imposed on goods passing through Warzenan ports, took the opportunity to seize the port of Tobuck for themselves, dealing another hefty blow to the economy. During the latter half of the 10th century, the nation languished under a string of negligent and incompetent kings, whose advisors only sought to enrich themselves. This caused anti-monarchist sentiment to fester, as calls for reform were ignored, and its proponents penalized, culminating in the formation of the Coalition of Anti-Monarchy Organizations, or CAMO for short, in the late 970s.\n\nWhen Zamaliahon XVI came to the throne, it seemed that things were finally looking up for Warzena. Under his leadership, the economy's decline began to slow, while new industries began to take root. Many began to wonder if Warzena would finally be able to get back on its legs. Unfortunately, they wouldn't get to find out as, in 1005, the Storm King attacked. His vast armada obliterated the kingdom's meager defenses, and soon, he had seized control of the country. The Second Temple was stripped of its valuables and the structure destroyed afterwards. The king was killed during a raid on the Royal Palace, seemingly snuffing out the country's last hope.\n\nThe conqueror would be slain only a few months later at the fateful battle of Ain Trotgourait, liberating the countless peoples that he had subjugated. But the country was now in ruins. Barekzamal VII, the late king's brother, was never meant to rule, and his inexperience has made the nation's problems all the more glaring. The economy is clinging on to life with Hippogriffian aid, but no one knows how long it can last like this. Zamivgazal lies in ruins, along with many parts of the countryside, and national morale is at an all-time low. All the while, CAMO has grown more popular than ever, as countless commoners flock to their cause, which promises a solution to the country's woes. Either way, it would take a miracle to heal this broken nation, and many are unsure if it can be done."

 warzena.3.t:0 "The Road Ahead"
 warzena.3.d:0 "The country is currently plagued by countless maladies, ranging from widespread economic downturn to local food shortages. The nation's cities are littered with rubble and crowded with the destitute, while the countryside is marred by busted roads and fields left fallow.\n\nIn order to alleviate this, the King's advisors have proposed a series of measures that would promote general recovery, with an emphasis on restoring the nation's urban centers and encouraging industrial development. Some in the court raised concerns about the proposal being too focused on the cities, and too neglectful of rural areas. After some heated debate, it was eventually passed to the King, who just barely managed to convince the dissenters that revitalizing the industrial sector was critical for long-term recovery, but made sure to incorporate extra provisions for rural recovery nonetheless.\n\nSimultaneously, CAMO's leaders have come up with a plan of their own to help reverse the nation's plight. Their efforts are on a smaller scale than anything the King could do, but their dedication is all that matters. Their main focus is the revitalization of their supporter base in the countryside, where CAMO members have been sent to assist in the reparation of local infrastructure and promote the replanting of fields so that food can make its way towards their urban allies. Although the plan is somewhat crude, with some more ambitious elements having been cut due to compromise, the organization's leaders are able to agree on it, and it will hopefully serve them well in garnering support for their cause.\n\nWith both plans being put into effect, ultimately, only one can truly capture the attention of the nation. It soon becomes clear that the more influential of the two was..."

It will be an uphill battle from start to finish, something both the King and CAMO are quite aware of.\n\nTo smooth over the process of recovery, the Royal Court has suggested passing further economic reforms in order to rejuvenate the economy. More specifically, their proposal calls for investments into entrepreneurial ventures in order to stimulate the economy with new jobs and increased production. The King also managed to introduce a stipulation for providing money to those that were hit hardest, such as laborers and artisans, so that they can contribute to the economy, but also to quell the growing tide of unrest by placating the people.\n\nCAMO's efforts are much more focused, involving a series of rallies in order to improve morale, as well as gatherings where commoners can mingle and forge strong bonds of community in order to overcome the lingering trauma from 1005. Meanwhile, CAMO's wealthier members will use their connections to sympathetic elites, as well as their own coffers, to provide for those suffering the most so that they can hopefully make their way out of poverty and achieve a comfortable standard of living.\n\nThe times ahead are challenging, but hard work is always rewarded, and in the end..."

Although it carries the risk of rejection, the King is confident that they can win over the hippogriffs and secure more much-needed construction materials and advisors.\n\nCAMO hopes to lessen the nation's reliance on the hippogriffs, believing it to be an unnecessary crutch. The head of the Warzenan Republican League, Itthozamal Ankeper, although not an anti-hippogriff himself, does believe that reducing the nation's reliance on them as early as possible is crucial towards a proper economic recovery and securing the future health of the economy. To that end, he has proposed a series of investment and reconstruction efforts in order to ease local economies and restore certain parts of the country to pre-Storm King productivity, which will be achieved by means of the WRL's, and his personal, connections to more liberal entrepreneurs in the country.\n\nAfter just a few weeks, the economy has shown signs of recovery, thanks in large part to..."

Even so, he isn't as universally despised as his father or grandfather, and he has enough tact and charm to please most people he meets. Although the Royal Court is somewhat hesitant about it, the king believes that the best way to restore faith in the crown is to mingle with the public and make himself more presentable.\n\nBennoam Shimzel, leader of the ultranationalist Hazrumenian Social Nationalist Party, is well regarded for his oratory skills, despite his more radical tendencies, while his literary background offers a pleasant eloquence to his diction that is unmatched by any of his peers. As such, he intends to host a series of rallies in order to drive support for CAMO's cause, and potentially his own party as well. CAMO's success hinges on popular support, and if they don't secure it as quickly as possible, Warzena may be forced to languish under the yoke of monarchist oppression for another 2 millennia.\n\nWhoever controls the people's heart's ultimately controls the nation, and by the end..."

Things aren't any better in the countryside, where acres of farmland were either razed or left to fallow, while thousands of farmers were forced to relocate to the cities, overloading the already overburdened relief infrastructure.\n\nThe King hopes to improve the situation by subsidizing farmers and encouraging migration into the country in order to repopulate it so that agricultural production can be increased. The hope is that, by providing housing and food security, he can stabilize the realm and ease dissent.\n\nCAMO's plans are equally as ambitious, with proposals to fund new industrial operations being spearheaded by Zaniiaton, the young leader of the Warzenan Communist Party.

Though soon, perhaps admittedly even a bit too soon, the nation would be led unto its future with him officially taking the reins. Was this what his late brother felt when he had ascended the throne? All the kings and queens before?\n\nKing Barekzamal smiled. To say all of this was daunting was the understatement of history.\n\nFinally, there was a knock on the door, and Barekzamal called for the invited guests. Quietly, the zebra wondered if he should've adorned something more regal than a modestly fashioned nightgown, but worries soon vanished upon the sight of the small contingent of priests entering and bowing with the barest of ornate robes.\n\n"Good evening, your highness," the head priest spoke, "forgive our lack of proper apparel, we were informed your request was urgent."\n\nThe king returned the courtesy in kind. "Of course, so as long as you all forgive mine."\n\nHe tactfully waited a few moments for their smiles to sink in before bowing his head. "I have summoned all of you here because Warzena will soon embark upon its future, and what lies ahead will undoubtedly determine the destiny of our kingdom. This has troubled me throughout, and I wish, well, to pray, for our future and Warzena's."\n\nOne of the priests spoke nonchalantly.

On the other claw, however, leaving Warzena defenseless will only be delaying the inevitable, and possibly leave Zumidia's western border completely exposed.

Following the integration of Warzena into our sphere, the companies have only grown more, but now it seems that there is a bit of friction. Warzena has recently lodged a formal request to impose taxes on the Hippogriffian corporations operating in their country.\n\nThey claim that, with the recovery of their economy, they no longer need to encourage growth via subsidies and must implement sensible tax policies. The corporations have protested in turn, saying that this would harm business and labelling it a betrayal. It is quite impudent of a satellite state to make such demands, and it would be negligent to indulge them.

[WAR.GetLeader], though little more than a figurehead, had become a symbol of both harmonist intransigence and hippogriff collaboration. On a hot day in a visit to a small village, three shots rang out.\n\nThe King was only hit once, but it was days before anycreature knew he would survive his wound, and weeks before he was let out of the Arisian hospital he was treated at. When he returned, he no longer recognized Warzena.\n\nOutrage at the would-be assassin and other CAMO ultranationalists was channeled into a ruthless purge. Family members denounced each other for anti-Arisian activity. The syncretist religious movement promoted by the hippogriffs -which saw the Warzenan and hippogriff gods as one and the same- finally gained traction, as service after service was held praying for the King.\n\n[WAR.GetLeader] had been transformed into a symbol of faith and national endurance, but in the interests of his protection he was not to leave the palace again except under heavy hippogriff guard."

The King probably didn't draft it, but whoever did was a zebra after his own heart. He'd have to meet them, whoever they were. Still, there were practical considerations.\n\nCeding Tobuck fully to Warzenan administration was not part of his plan at all; Tobuck was to be exploited more thoroughly, rather than given the special treatment due to Warzenans. And besides, they were mostly ponies: while ceding Tobuck would bolster Warzenan pride, it could dilute their national-racial character in the long run. It might even give them ideas. Ideas of independence.\n\nOn the other claw, the Warzenans could probably handle it cheaper and more easily. Some part of Crack did want to reward this kind of thinking from his favourite subjects.

On the other hoof however, it has made them much more cautious, which, combined with the aforementioned aggression, has made them a particularly painful thorn in our side.\n\nThe most active of the radicals are the WCP and the HSNP, the forefront of CAMO's radical left and right wing movements, respectively. Zaniiaton, head of the WCP, was one of the few CAMO members we were completely unable to trail, as she seems to blend into the countryside, like a ghost in the shadows. It seems that she has grown even more discreet, staking out careful, but effective, raids on our posts and towns. If she is not dealt with soon, unrest may begin to grow in the rural regions. Meanwhile, the HSNP's Bennoam Shimzel is a character that we have had no problem tracking, but his connections to officials have kept him safe, while his remaining followers, zealous in their devotion, have always managed to skirt him away to safety when all else failed. Should this continue, Shimzel may yet be able to regain his footing and continue to challenge our rule.\n\nMeanwhile, CAMO's other factions have not entirely disappeared either. Although Itthozamal Ankeper, former head of the WRL, has been dealt with, many of his allies have managed to escape and have since banded with other moderate elements to form the League for a Free Warzena, which has continued to operate in secret.

 warzena.38.d:0 "Barekzamal walked quietly towards the Royal Court's chamber room. He had hoped to create some kind of Parliament after the war, so that the people's voice could be heard and their ideas...he was going off track again. He had to stay focused. He was here for more pressing matters.\n\nAfter greeting his ministers and courtiers and settling into his seat, Barekzamal cut to the chase, "After so much struggle and bloodshed, our nation is finally at peace. However, although we have solved many of our nation's old woes, new ones are beginning to crop up. The most prominent is the animosity of...", he paused, trying to find the right words,"... our new subjects. That is why I have summoned you today. If we are to build a new peace, we must address this quickly." He was immediately beset by a flurry of suggestions as the court filled with debate. This was quickly cut short when a young stallion exclaimed, "Your Majesty, is it not obvious what we must do? We must eliminate the zealots as quickly as possible. Send in the troops and give them no mercy!"\n\nThis outcry was punctuated by several shocked gasps, hushed murmurs, and even a few nods in agreement. The room devolved into violent bickering, and Barekzamal barely managed to restore order. Facing the stallion, he said, "And why would you suggest such a thing? Should we not treat them as fairly as any subject?" The stallion replied, "Why do they deserve our kindness? They are heartless beasts, every last one of them! They abducted our people, pillaged our homes, destroyed our families. And you want to give them mercy?! I'm sorry, your Majesty, but I can't accept that."\n\nBarekzamal pondered this. Yes, the Chiropterrans hadn't been the most amicable of neighbors. But, to repay that with more malice would be short sighted, and that's not what anyone needed right now. Facing the stallion again, Barekzamal spoke, "You are right. The Chiropterrans have given us much pain over the centuries. But to return with just as much hatred would only make things worse. I feel that, if we want to truly be at peace, we must let go of that hate." Turning back to the court, he spoke, "I propose that we demilitarize the nation, to ease the tension. Then, we can bring about a true peace for all of our peoples". After a few seconds of stunned silence, the court quickly erupted into a chorus of cheers and applause. It wasn't going to be easy, but it was the right step to take."

 warzena.39.d:0 "The town hall at Miharzehir was bustling with activity, as secretaries frenzily shuttled documents and cooks double and triple checked the hors d'oeuvres. Meanwhile, Barekzamal watched over the final preparations with equal parts nervous apprehension and eager anticipation. For the first time since the Storm King's invasion, Miharzehir was to serve as Warzena's gate to the world, and Barekzamal was keen for this event to go off without a hitch.\n\nA few months earlier, he had petitioned the rulers of Zarantia and Maregypt to see if they would be willing to work out a diplomatic agreement between their nations and Warzena. Fortunately, they had agreed, and now, he was determined to make this work, especially with the Zarantians, with whom relations were already tense. He had declined to participate in the actual meeting, believing that his presence would create undue pressure on the diplomats. As the last of the attendees settled in, Barekzamal could only wait and hope that it went well.\n\nAfter several excruciating hours, Barekzamal was surprised to see a secretary at the door beckoning him to enter. After making his way to the meeting room, he was suddenly met with cheers and well wishes from the foreign delegations. Taken aback, he was led to a seat, and a young Warzenan ambassador summarized the meeting's results to him. What she told him made him happier than he could ever imagine. Not only had his diplomats been able to reach a rapport with the delegations, but they had also managed to secure several lucrative international trading agreements and, to top it off, official treatices of non-aggression! A monumental success exceeding all expectations! Elated beyond measure, Barekzamal spent the rest of the afternoon engaged in eager conversation with the diplomats, and personally bade them farewell as they departed. With this, he was now one step closer to ensuring the harmonious future his people deserved."

 warzena.40.d:0 "As the Warzenan mission pulled into Batsby, they were pleasantly surprised that their convoy had not been immediately fired upon by angry ex-Legionnaires. Of course, the fact that they could only see a dozen creatures gathered in the town square was still cause for concern, so their guards remained on high alert.\n\nThe head of the mission, a middle-aged zebra mare named Gerzanit, stepped out of the truck first, and slowly approached the old and scarred thestral stallion at the head of the group. She barely had a chance to speak before being met by his hostility, as the elder proceeded to steadily work his way through a truly splendid catalogue of insults, where 'old hag' had been only the start, but Gerzanit stood her ground with great calm and patience. She eventually managed to defuse the situation by explaining that they were there in a gesture of good faith. Her words alone had maybe not had too much of an impact, but the crates of food, clothing, fuel, and tools, as well as a large collection of toys for the children, had helped a lot. It had, however, taken Gerzanit dismissing her soldiers as a sign of trust to make the curmudgeonly old thestral listen.\n\nOnce that was sorted, she directed the rest of the mission to begin distributing goods to the group, who were pleased by the treats the mission had brought. The sound of lively chatter drew out the rest of the residents, who had hidden before the mission arrived. An earth pony filly, who had noticed the toys earlier, timidly approached the stallion passing them out, and pointed to a small plush doll.\n\n"C-c-could I-i have that one? M-my sister r-really likes those."\n\n"Sure kiddo, here you go." Muttering a brief thanks, the filly nervously dashed away. The stallion was soon swarmed by dozens of foals, all begging for toys. As the mission continued to mingle with the townsfolk, Gerzanit was very pleased to see everyone getting along, especially so when she spotted the old thestral hesitantly approach the mare handing out sweets."

 warzena.41.d:0 "Askalion's central station was buzzing with activity as trains loaded with zebra, hippogriff, and seapony dignitaries continued to pull in. The station had been connected to the Seaquestrian rail network only a few years ago, but it was already the busiest rail line in the whole country. The arriving diginitaries made their way through the illuminated streets of the city, adorned with banners welcoming the Hippogriffians, and full of friendly residents, who eagerly gave them gifts and warm welcomes.\n\nThe last of the dignitaries finally arrived at a grand banquet hall, built especially for the occasion, and fitted with special entrances to accommodate any seaponies arriving by fin. After everyone had settled in, the meeting began, as diplomats from both sides worked together to forge a new treaty, one that would ensure that the alliance between Warzena and Hippogriffia would last for centuries to come. Despite some minor disagreements over trade policy, the meeting went off without a hitch. After the last few details were ironed out, the meeting was adjourned, and the press was invited inside to broadcast the signing of the treaty to the people of both nations.\n\nWith the official business out of the way, the tables were rearranged and filled with all sorts of delicious dishes, ranging from traditional Warzenan cuisine to classic Hippogriffian staples. An orchestral band opened with the national anthems of both kingdoms, before filling the hall with the sound of classical tunes from the region. As the night went on, the dignitaries danced and conversed with each other, and the event concluded with everyone in high spirits. When the trains departed the following morning, the dignitaries were given a heartfelt farewell from the townsfolk, and the aura of good feelings remained over Askalion for the next week."

 warzena.42.d:0 "Zamivgazal's central square was abuzz with activity, as dozens of merchants clamored for the attention of passers-by in order to peddle their wares. The stalls were packed to the brim with all sorts of goods, both local and exotic, and surrounded by colorful tarps and posterboards promising great bargains. Nearby, construction was underway on a mixed-use building, which would accommodate shops on its ground floor, and plenty of affordable housing above. This was the first of its kind in the whole country, and people were eager to see what would come of it. There were even rumors that foreign companies had purchased lots to secure an opening into the burgeoning Warzenan market.\n\nAmidst all the commotion of the city center, the people go about their day, taking lunch breaks, meeting friends, or just enjoying the scenery. The whole view is rather idyllic, which makes it all the more unbelievable that a little over five years ago, this place looked like a ghost town. But now the streets, once full of nothing but rubble and despair, are alive with smiles and hope. Never before has Zamivgazal prospered this much, nor its denizens been so happy. And if one were to ask the reason for their joy, no doubt they would say, "Gods praise the King."\n\nEven if Barekzamal himself won't say it, the people are more than happy to laud his reform efforts and shrewd leadership as the primary reasons for Warzena's prosperity and continued survival. Some even call him the greatest king Warzena has ever seen. The nation loves its king, and it seems that the gods do as well. It seems that peaceful moments such as these are due to become just another afternoon in Zamivgazal."

 warzena.43.d:0 "The chatter and shuffling in the conference hall began to die down as the official starting time approached, while the last few attendees finished trickling in. This conference, one of the largest of its kind to ever be hosted in the country, and possibly the whole region, was the amalgamation of nearly a year of hard work. Gathered in this giant hall near the heart of Zamivgazal, purpose-built for the occasion, were dozens of ambassadors, diplomats, and assorted officials from across North Zebrica. Among them were diplomatic legations from Hippogriffia, Colthage, and Chiropterra, alongside representatives for Zarantia and Zumidia, and even emissaries from the Quaggatai and isolationist Macawia.\n\nDespite their differences, those present were united by one overarching purpose: the creation of a true peace in North Zebrica. For the past decade, the region had been subjected to catastrophe, bloodshed, and tragedy, something everyone present was acutely aware of. The meeting opened with a speech from King Barekzamal himself, thanking everyone for their attendance, and inviting them to let go of their grudges so that they could build a peaceful future together. After the applause died down, the conference commenced, and the hall quickly filled with the sound of deliberation and discussion, which was broken up only by speeches from delegates and breaks for meals and religious ceremonies. Eventually, after nearly three days of debate, the conference ratified a series of treatices that were to serve as the blueprint for a new age of peace and harmony in North Zebrica.\n\nAfterwards, the king delivered his concluding speech, lauding everyone for their efforts and expressing his enthusiasm for the future, which was met with raucous applause. It was followed up with an official ceremony that was broadcast across regional radio, and a lavish banquet adorned with countless local delicacies. With the conference's formal conclusion, the attendees departed with a sense of accomplishment and joy, and an air of good feelings remained over the city for weeks."

 ### LEADER DESCRIPTIONS ###

 WAR_king_zarizel_ii:0 "King Barekzamal VII"
 WAR_king_zarizel_ii_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 24th of August, 984 in Zamivgazal\n\n§YBiography§!: The second son of Zamaliahon XV, Barekzamal had an idyllic childhood, free of struggle. While his brother Zamaliahon was subject to endless tutoring as the crown prince, Barekzamal spent his days playing with the foals of the nobility, his favourite being Ummazanit Nazlayn, the daughter of a prominent noble.\n\nSoon after Zamaliahon was made king in 1001, Barekzamal and Ummazanit married and sired their first foal, a colt named Hannizamal. However, since Barekzamal was technically his brother's successor, he did make an effort to educate himself on the basics of statecraft and governance. But there was no rush. After all, they were young and had their whole lives ahead of them. His brother would eventually find a nice mare and Barekzamal could live the rest of his life in bliss. Unfortunately, the gods had other plans for the young prince and in 1005 his precious world was turned upside down.\n\nAs the Storm King swept through the kingdom, Barekzamal managed to escape, but his brother was killed in the Palace by the invaders. After the conqueror was slain, Barekzamal returned to Zamivgazal a changed person. He quickly set to work, trying to keep the nation afloat. Although he had some success, for the most part his policies were ineffective as his inexperience betrayed him. Now, he sits uneasy on the throne as the threat of revolt grows. The fate of the nation rests on his haunches and it will take monumental effort on his part to keep it - and his throne - from falling out of his grasp. But Barekzamal is determined to bring Warzena into a brighter future, where he can smile with his family once more.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Kessel"

 WAR_taniiaton:0 "Zaniiaton"
 WAR_taniiaton_desc:0 "#TODO - Currently in her late 20s, daughter of a poor laborer in Zammar, she has led a difficult life. She's so poor she doesn't even have a last name. Constantly surrounded by urban laborers and peasants struggling to make ends meet, she has become acutely aware of their suffering. Managed to find a worn-out copy of the Marksist manifesto when she was around high school age and read it religiously. She eventually managed to make contact with other Marksists and quickly became the leader of their movement, organizing it like no one had before. Her goal is to bring the revolution to Zonicia and liberate its people from bourgeois exploitation.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Stephen Sen"
 WAR_benoam_zaadeh:0 "Bennoam Shimzel"
 WAR_benoam_zaadeh_desc:0 "#TODO - A charming stallion in his mid-30s, Shimzel is the son of a middle-class worker from Zimash. He harbored an interest in history from an early age, especially ancient Warzenan history. It was during his time in university that he became enamored with the idea of creating a united Hazrumenia, with Warzena at its center. After graduating he began to draw a small but loyal following thanks to his charisma and sophistication. He eventually solidifed his ideals into a manifesto and drew in even more followers. Serving as CAMO's PR person, he allowed them to survive despite overwhelming odds and secured his power base. He and his followers will ensure that the dream of a united Hazrumenia becomes a reality, no matter what.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Ryan"
 WAR_itthozamal_ankeper:0 "Itthozamal Ankeper"
 WAR_itthozamal_ankeper_desc:0 "#TODO- Nearing his 60s, Ankeper is the son of a well-off merchant family in Zamivgazal. The hardships of the mid-10th century imprinted themselves on him and his family began to suffer as Warzena's leadership grew ever more incompetent. When he entered higher education, he was drawn to groups that were critical of the monarchy, which were subsequently outlawed by it. Ankeper banded with others to form the WRL, an anti-monarchist club oriented around creating a democratic Zonician republic in the spirit of Zinuzel Zidalid. He met his current husband during the club's early days and the two wed a few years later. He was a prominent leader in CAMO owing to his seniority and passion. His health has begun to wane in recent years, but that won't stop him from finally bringing Zidalid's vision to life.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: DeerTrax"
 WAR_imzanit_azpin:0 "Imzanit Azpin"
 WAR_imzanit_azpin_desc:0 "#TODO- A lovely young mare in her mid-20s, Azpin was born to pro-republican laborers in Askalion who later migrated to Zamivgazal. She was drawn to politics from a young age, driven by a burning desire to make people's lives better. This unbridled optimism, bordering on childish naivete, drew the attention of many within the WRL during her tenure at a republican-owned shop in Zamivgazal. She even caught the eyes of Ankeper, the WRL's leader, who took her in as a protege, recognizing that he needed a capable successor to entrust his vision to. Inexperienced, idealistic, and dedicated to realizing her mentor's dreams, she is generally optimistic, but a little too cautious sometimes. Now at the helm of the republic, she will ensure that Ankeper's trust was not misplaced and that the WRL's efforts were not in vain.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Moonatik"

 WAR_reeling_from_shock:0 "Reeling From The Shock"
 WAR_reeling_from_shock_desc:0 "The Storm King's invasion has left the nation shell-shocked and many are unsure of where to go. The king is doing his best to keep the peace, but his opposition see it as their time to strike and bring change to this ancient kingdom."
 WAR_road_to_recovery:0 "The Road To Recovery..."
 WAR_road_to_recovery_desc:0 "To say Warzena's situation is bad would be a gross understatement. However, sitting around on our rumps all day complaining won't do anyone any good and the country must stand up and begin to look towards the future once more."
 WAR_is_not_easy:0 "...Isn't An Easy One"
 WAR_is_not_easy_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, all the romantic bravado in the world isn't enough to hide the monumental challenges that face us as we attempt to rebuild the nation. But, it does work as solid motivation to keep the people going as we struggle for a brighter future."
 WAR_stop_the_bleeding:0 "Stop The Bleeding"
 WAR_stop_the_bleeding_desc:0 "Currently on its last legs and being kept barely afloat by Hippogriffian aid, the economy is in a particularly sorry state. We must take any measures necessary to stop the economy from collapsing outright, even if they're only temporary."
 WAR_the_peoples_hearts:0 "The People's Hearts"
 WAR_the_peoples_hearts_desc:0 "The Warzenan commonfolk have suffered the most from the events of the past few years and they have been almost completely demoralized. We must temper the people's hearts, to ease the pain of what came before and to prepare them for what is to follow."
 WAR_assess_the_damage:0 "Assess The Damage"
 WAR_assess_the_damage_desc:0 "Even though the abysmal state of the nation is clear to anyone who looks, the real question is how bad the damage truly is. We must assess the nation to truly understand the harm done and come up with the most effective course of action as quickly as possible."
 WAR_a_crucial_hour:0 "A Crucial Hour"
 WAR_a_crucial_hour_desc:0 "A crucial hour has befallen Warzena: will she stick to a status quo spanning the millennia, or will she start anew in this ever changing world?"
 WAR_faith_in_king:0 "Faith In The King"
 WAR_faith_in_king_desc:0 "It seems that tradition has managed to persevere once more. Now all of Warzena looks towards King Barekzamal to be the king he needs to be and the leader they believe he can be."
 WAR_a_hasty_prayer:0 "A Hasty Prayer"
 WAR_a_hasty_prayer_desc:0 "Although he has managed to keep his throne, the King has nevertheless become overburdened by stress. Hopefully, the support of the clergy and the gods will prove sufficient to aid him in these trying times."
 WAR_appease_the_rabble:0 "Appease The Rabble"
 WAR_appease_the_rabble_desc:0 "The people are uppity and a palpable tension hangs in the air. That isn't to say that their qualms are unjustified, as much of the current situation is the result of incompetent leadership. Nevertheless, if we do not assuage them soon, CAMO may be able to regain its waning momentum."
 WAR_emergency_measures:0 "Emergency Measures"
 WAR_emergency_measures_desc:0 "Although we have managed to prevent the country from collapsing outright, the situation is still tenuous at best and without further measures, may spiral completely out of our control. Even if they are temporary, these policies will ensure that the country can keep its bearings until a more permanent solution is implemented."
 WAR_traitors_among_us:0 "The Traitors Among Us..."
 WAR_traitors_among_us_desc:0 "Although we would like to believe that the royal court can be trusted, we must accept the harsh reality that there are traitors and backstabbers among us, with even the king's closest advisors being potential impostors relaying information to our enemies."
 WAR_all_around_us:0 "...And All Around Us"
 WAR_all_around_us_desc:0 "All across the country, there is a vast network of those opposed to the monarchy, consisting of a myriad of different people, coming from different walks of life. They blend in with the crowds and are nearly undetectable. But, they are not invincible. If the main agents of dissidence can be tracked down and neutralized, then the beast they built will surely follow."
 WAR_proper_coronation:0 "A Proper Coronation"
 WAR_proper_coronation_desc:0 "After 3 years of devastation and misery, Warzena is finally able to witness the coronation of her king. While he may not have been intended for the throne, it is now his and it is now up to him to use its powers to guide the country towards a better and brighter future."

 ## CAMO Opening ##
 WAR_a_fresh_start:0 "A Fresh Start"

 WAR_win_the_cities:0 "Win the Cities"
 WAR_win_the_cities_desc:0 "Even though Warzena is by no means an urbanized country, its cities are still the main centers of power. Currently, they host a significant amount of opposition, consisting primarily of urban nobles and conservative clergy. If we are to maintain our position, we must ensure that the cities follow our lead and not the other way around."
 WAR_secure_king:0 "Secure the Royals"
 WAR_secure_king_desc:0 "While we have managed to overthrow the monarchy itself, we can't rest on our laurels just yet. Even though the king and his family were successfully captured, their current placement in the palace is not exactly a secret. If we are to keep the restorationist movement from gaining any further traction, we must ensure that their guiding light is somewhere outside their reach."
 WAR_maintain_the_country:0 "Maintain the Country"
 WAR_maintain_the_country_desc:0 "For the longest time, Warzena's extensive rural regions have been our refuge, having saved our movement from certain death many times. However, also found in the country are the landed aristocracy, who will do anything in their power to oppose us. Thus, if we are to preserve our sanctuary, this hindrance must be removed posthaste."
 WAR_the_last_meeting:0 "The Last Meeting"
 WAR_the_last_meeting_desc:0 "As the internal situation stabilizes, CAMO's leaders have decided to reconvene to determine their next steps. With the loss of their common enemy, many of the factions have begun to squabble amongst themselves, straining CAMO's cohesion. Amidst the infighting and debates, only one thing remains certain: this meeting will determine whose vision will shape the nation's future."

 ## Zaniiaton Tree ##
 WAR_zaniiaton_prevails:0 "Zaniiaton Prevails"
 WAR_zaniiaton_prevails_desc:0 "Following CAMO's final meeting, Zaniiaton and the upstart WCP have managed to scrape their way to the top in the ensuing power struggle. Now the time has come for Warzena to embrace the revolution and Zaniiaton shall be the one to bring it.\nWorkers of Warzena, rejoice!"
 WAR_revolution_in_warzena:0 "The Revolution in Warzena"
 WAR_revolution_in_warzena_desc:0 "Although we now control much of the apparatus of state, many parts of the nation remain, at best, ambivalent to our cause. Reactionary resistance remains a threat in conservative areas, while many farmers treat us with suspicion. If the revolution is to spread, we must work to ensure its survival in Warzena first."
 WAR_sever_church_and_state:0 "Sever Temple And State"
 WAR_sever_church_and_state_desc:0 "For much of its history, Warzena's clergy has been very prominent, holding tremendous influence over its rulers and often guiding the affairs of state. Such meddling by power-hungry priests is the nation's greatest crutch and it must rid itself of their burdensome desires if any real progress is to be made."
 WAR_organize_the_unions:0 "Organize the Unions"
 WAR_organize_the_unions_desc:0 "Proper worker's unions are few and far between, with most groups being loose bands without any real goals. Thus, to truly liberate the workers, we must give them the means to empower themselves by providing effective leadership and more capable organizational structure."
 WAR_rural_proles:0 "The Rural Proletariat"
 WAR_rural_proles_desc:0 "Warzena is a mostly agrarian nation, with a large portion of the population living in rural areas. Of these, the overwhelming majority are peasants, forced to toil under the oppression of landlords and barons. Thus, it is only fair that we recognize their struggle and acknowledge them as fellow comrades."
 WAR_dismantle_bougie:0 "Dismantle the Bourgeoisie"
 WAR_dismantle_bougie_desc:0 "Despite being removed from power, the bourgeoisie remain a potent threat, fueling resistance and leading our comrades astray with lies. For the revolution to truly succeed, they must be brought down once and for all. Only then can we truly seize the means of production and be finally rid of their corruption."
 WAR_organic_collectivization:0 "Organic Collectivization"
 WAR_organic_collectivization_desc:0 "The issue of collectivization has become a hot topic, with many being split on how it should be implemented, ranging from total centralization to none whatsoever. The AWC has proposed a compromise, where farmers can begin the process themselves with only limited state oversight, which promises to reduce the downsides of either extreme."
 WAR_peoples_bureau_industry:0 "People's Bureau of Industry"
 WAR_peoples_bureau_industry_desc:0 "For all of its recent successes, the revolution still remains weakened by the fact that it occurred without the proper material conditions being present. To rectify this, a new state ministry will be created to oversee industrial development and bolster the revolution's foundations by fostering the necessary conditions."
 WAR_reach_comrades:0 "Reach Out to Comrades"
 WAR_reach_comrades_desc:0 "It is clear as day that it will be nigh-impossible to get any form of recognition from our neighbors, who view us with fear and distrust. Our only hope for receiving any kind of support is to connect with our comrades around the world and advocate for the potential of our revolution."
 WAR_contact_clubs:0 "Contact the Socialist Clubs"
 WAR_contact_clubs_desc:0 "While Hippogriffia may appear to be content with its status quo, there are dissident elements lurking just beneath the surface. Among these are the Socialist Clubs, which constitute the bulk of the nation's meek communist movement. If we can bring them to our side, we may be able to acquire a partnership of invaluable strength and immense usefulness."
 WAR_bidding_farewell:0 "Bidding Farewell"
 WAR_bidding_farewell_desc:0 "With the establishment of the revolution in Warzena, the hippogriffs have seen the writing on the wall and have begun to withdraw. Their support was crucial in the past but the nation is moving beyond the need for capitalist interference. The best we can do now is send them off with a smile and say our farewells on good terms."
 WAR_no_more_kings:0 "No More Kings!"
 WAR_no_more_kings_desc:0 "Warzena has suffered under the weight of kings for too long, whether they be native, Quaggatai or, more recently, yeti. It is time that the people rise up and cast off the shackles of autocratic oppression to take control of their own destiny.\n\nThe age of tyrants is over! The age of the workers has begun!"
 WAR_implement_septennial_guides:0 "Implement the Septennial Guidelines"
 WAR_implement_septennial_guides_desc:0 "If the nation is to attain modern standards of living and productivity, we must have an effective plan for doing so. While centralized efforts may be more productive initially, ultimately the best option in the long run is to incentivize producers to follow a series of guidelines over the course of seven years, which should be ample time for our efforts to bear fruit."
 WAR_defense_commissar:0 "Commissariat of Defense"
 WAR_defense_commissar_desc:0 "It has grown more and more apparent that the survival of the revolution rests on a knife's edge as reactionary threats continue to mount on our borders. In response to this, a branch of the PBI has been established to oversee the militarization of industry needed to support and strengthen our military when the need to defend the revolution arises."
 WAR_guns_of_revolution:0 "Guns of the Revolution"
 WAR_guns_of_revolution_desc:0 "As we continue to ready ourselves to battle against the revolution's enemies, our military has found itself facing several equipment shortages, especially in regards to arms. While repurposing civilian industries for military use may aid in addressing this deficit, the most effective option is to construct new arms factories that will produce more quality materiel more quickly."
 WAR_expand_transport_ministry:0 "Expand the Transportation Ministry"
 WAR_expand_transport_ministry_desc:0 "As the nation grows, it would be prudent to ensure that its transportation infrastructure expands with it. Our difficulties in doing so suggest that we must dedicate more resources to the relevant agencies so that our roads and rails remain in prime operating conditions."
 WAR_forgotten_port:0 "The Forgotten Port"
 WAR_forgotten_port_desc:0 "Although it has been part of Warzena for millennia, the northern port of Askalion has often been neglected in favor of its southern counterparts. To redress this injustice, we will repave the crumbling roads, refurbish the old harbor, and expand the dockyards so that we may breathe life back into the town and never leave it to rot again."
 WAR_create_oils:0 "Create the OILS"
 WAR_create_oils_desc:0 "Keeping our logistical systems running smoothly is vital, but we must also keep tabs on counterrevolutionary forces both in and outside the nation. In order to fulfill both objectives, the Office of Internal Logistics and Security has been inaugurated to ensure that the revolution is preserved at all costs."
 WAR_secularize_education:0 "Secularize Education"
 WAR_secularize_education_desc:0 "For countless centuries, education in Warzena has been dominated by the clergy, who often used it as a means to suppress the proletariat. Now that the revolution has come, education must likewise be liberated so that the people can achieve true wisdom and reject reactionary propaganda."
 WAR_found_new_institutes:0 "Found New Institutes"
 WAR_found_new_institutes_desc:0 "As more and more people flock to the new secular schools, we must make sure that they have somewhere to apply their intellect. By promoting the creation of new institutes of research and scientific exploration, we can ensure that our people lead the world in new advancements."

The WRL now stands at the helm, ready to usher in a new era of freedom and democracy for the people of Warzena."
 WAR_first_parliament:0 "The First Parliament"
 WAR_first_parliament_desc:0 "Warzena has never had a strong democratic tradition, as any representation its monarchs offered was token at best. If we are to truly empower the people, we must provide them with an appropriate institution. Although it may not be easy, establishing a proper representative body will be a huge step in building a true democratic spirit."
 WAR_legitimizing_the_republic:0 "Legitimizing the Republic"
 WAR_legitimizing_the_republic_desc:0 "With the end of the monarchy, our diplomatic standing is tenuous at best and we are seen as little more than upstart usurpers. If we are to successfully navigate the treachery of foreign diplomacy, we must secure foreign recognition for our new government."
 WAR_preserving_the_republic:0 "Preserving the Republic"
 WAR_preserving_the_republic_desc:0 "Although we have managed to deal with the most outward resistance, our position is still not fully secure.

 WAR_matter_of_hippos:0 "The Matter of Foreign Aid"
 WAR_matter_of_hippos_desc:0 "In recent years, the hippogriffs have provided us with invaluable support, both material and otherwise.

 WAR_dreams_of_zonicia_desc:0 "For nearly 200 years, Zinuzel Zidalid's vision of a united Zonicia has remained unfulfilled, seemingly left behind to rot away in the past.

 WAR_the_new_coalition:0 "The New Coalition"

If we are to build a better future, we must cast off this lingering ghost and reinvigorate our people's spirits."
 WAR_fund_public_education:0 "Fund Public Education"
 WAR_fund_public_education_desc:0 "A democracy is only as strong as its people and wisdom is the greatest of strengths the people can have.

 WAR_expand_zamivgazal_uni:0 "Expand the University of Zamivgazal"
 WAR_expand_zamivgazal_uni_desc:0 "The nation's oldest institution of tertiary education, the University of Zamivgazal has fallen on hard times as of late, suffering from inadequate supply and staff shortages. We must address these issues if we are to provide the foundation needed to cultivate a new generation of trailblazing thinkers and innovators."
 WAR_support_scientific_institutes:0 "Support Scientific Institutes"
 WAR_support_scientific_institutes_desc:0 "We must put our best and brightest to good use if we are to remain on the cutting edge of innovation. The most optimal way of achieving this is by investing in new research institutes to ensure that they have the resources needed to survive their early growing pains and show results down the line."
 WAR_economic_recovery_plan:0 "Economic Recovery Plan"
 WAR_economic_recovery_plan_desc:0 "Warzena's economy was already crumbling before the Storm King came; he was simply the nail in the coffin. Economic matters were too contentious to discuss in the days of CAMO rule, but now, with a unified mandate in parliament behind us, we can begin to draft a proper economic policy that will bring the nation out of its stupor."
 WAR_strengthen_our_forts:0 "Strengthen Our Fortifications"
 WAR_strengthen_our_forts_desc:0 "Subject to years of neglect and decay, the current state of Warzena's static defenses can be described as pitiful, at best. If we are to defend the core of our nation from enemy assault, we must strengthen and expand our defensive line to ensure that no enemy takes even an inch of our land."
 WAR_expand_military_rd:0 "Expand Military R&D"
 WAR_expand_military_rd_desc:0 "In this age of industrialized warfare, a nation's innovative capability is just as vital as its logistics infrastructure. By integrating our scientific potential into the military-industrial complex, we can ensure that our armed forces possess as much of a technological and tactical advantage as possible."
 WAR_a_pragmatic_ally:0 "A Pragmatic Ally"
 WAR_a_pragmatic_ally_desc:0 "While relations between our nations have certainly cooled following the abolition of the monarchy, Hippogriffia still remains of great importance to us. With their advanced technology and capable military, it is crucial that we maintain friendly relations so that our republic may yet live to see another day."
 WAR_subsidize_entrepreneurs:0 "Subsidize Entrepreneurs"
 WAR_subsidize_entrepreneurs_desc:0 "Although new factories are being built on a regular basis, it is simply not enough to support the nation. By offering support to enterprising businesszebras, we can greatly increase our industrial output while also providing additional employment and more goods for both domestic and foreign markets."
 WAR_boost_military_production:0 "Boost Military Production"
 WAR_boost_military_production_desc:0 "At present, our military's greatest weakness is a crippling lack of supply, with shortages in materiel and vital support equipment. We must increase the scale of our manufacturing capabilities to ensure that our forces are well-equipped and ready to face any threat to our republic."
 WAR_the_looming_threat:0 "The Looming Threat"
 WAR_the_looming_threat_desc:0 "Initially nothing more than an infrequent nuisance and the stuff of old mares' tales, it has become abundantly clear in recent years that the neighboring Chiropterrans are a far more potent danger than we presumed. We must ready ourselves to face them if, nay when, they decide to strike."
 WAR_head_house_towns:0 "A Head House in Every Town"
 WAR_head_house_towns_desc:0 "If we are to bring Warzena into the modern age, we must create a means of quickly ferrying people, goods, and troops around the country. Creating an extensive railway network is the most cost-effective method to achieve this while thoroughly interconnecting our cities and the back-country in between."
 WAR_the_postwar_order:0 "The Postwar Order"
 WAR_the_postwar_order_desc:0 "Now that peace has returned to North Zebrica, we must assess the situation and decide our next steps. Undoubtedly, the foremost priority is to deal with the recently acquired lands and ensure their peaceful integration into the republic. Only then we can finally turn our attention towards loftier ambitions."
 WAR_tobuck_accord:0 "The Tobuck Accord"
 WAR_tobuck_accord_desc:0 "With the defeat of Chiropterra, the issue of Tobuck has once again become a point of contention between us and Zarantia. However, as we have little interest in the city of Tobuck itself, it may be possible to quietly resolve the matter. By working with the Zarantians, we can reach an agreement that leaves both sides satisfied."
 WAR_negotiate_for_zumidia:0 "Negotiate For Zumidia"
 WAR_negotiate_for_zumidia_desc:0 "The first step in achieving our dream of a united Zonicia is to reunite with our brethren in Zumidia. Currently held by Hippogriffia, a nation whose military greatly outshines our own, using force is not an option. Instead, we will approach them diplomatically and inquire an appropriate price. It may hurt initially, but it is a sacrifice we are willing to make."
 WAR_southern_forts:0 "Southern Fortifications"
 WAR_southern_forts_desc:0 "With the integration of the lands acquired from Chiropterra nearly complete, our next priority is to bolster the region's defenses. Alongside granting enhanced protection from outside attackers, it also allows us to exert better control over the area and deter those who might take issue with our continued presence there."
 WAR_integrate_rail_networks:0 "Integrate the Rail Networks"
 WAR_integrate_rail_networks_desc:0 "Although we have managed to bring new territories into the republic, their infrastructure has remained disconnected from ours. If we are to truly incorporate these regions into our nation, then we must bring together the various systems and lines into one unifying rail network."
 WAR_establish_zumidian_ar:0 "Establish the Zumidian AR"
 WAR_establish_zumidian_ar_desc:0 "With the transfer of Zumidia to our control, we are now one step closer to achieving our dream. In order to properly administer the region, we will establish an autonomous republic, which will allow the Zumidians to be more involved in the democratic process while also serving as a model for future territories. "
 WAR_southern_dev:0 "Encourage Southern Development"
 WAR_southern_dev_desc:0 "After much work, we have finally managed to establish ourselves in the southern provinces and any lingering opposition has begun to fade away. In order to show our new citizens that we have their best interests at heart, we must invest in developing their war-torn lands and bringing them the prosperity they deserve."
 WAR_ursagrad_shipyards:0 "Shipyards of Ursagrad"
 WAR_ursagrad_shipyards_desc:0 "A crucial factor in realizing our dream is possessing a fleet capable of fending off the Colthaginians. Thankfully, we have access to an isolated section of the Green Bay; the perfect place to center our naval production. By expanding the dockyards at Ursagrad, we can begin to grow and train our new fleet away from prying eyes."
 WAR_fortify_aurez_hills:0 "Fortify the Aurez Hills"
 WAR_fortify_aurez_hills_desc:0 "In advancing our ambitions, conflict with Colthage seems ever likelier. Therefore, it is imperative that our border is well defended. Zumidia's Aurez Hills serve as an excellent natural barrier and by constructing lines of advanced fortifications, we can augment those defensive capabilities, ensuring that we can repel any enemy assault."
 WAR_support_zumidian_industry:0 "Support Zumidian Industry"
 WAR_support_zumidian_industry_desc:0 "Years of political turmoil and uncertainty have resulted in Zumidia's industrial sector being somewhat lacking in comparison to our own. Promoting industrial development in our sister republic will allow the region's economy to boom and for its people to flourish, with the added benefit of supplementing our military production."
 WAR_grand_objective:0 "The Grand Objective"
 WAR_grand_objective_desc:0 "The time has come. We have bolstered our economy, expanded our infrastructure, mustered our forces, and built new ships and aircraft. In order to achieve our dream, we must strike now while we have the best chance at victory. The heart of Zonicia awaits!"
 WAR_neuter_quaggatai:0 "Neuter the Quaggatai"
 WAR_neuter_quaggatai_desc:0 "With most of Zonicia now under our control, a new issue has arisen. The Quaggatai, the scourge of the steppes, still remain on our southern border. Although they are significantly weaker now, who knows what the future may bring. The best option is to strike first and prevent them from being a threat ever again."
 WAR_issue_of_karalpaka:0 "The Issue of Kar-Alpaka"
 WAR_issue_of_karalpaka_desc:0 "The port of Kar-Alpaka and the surrounding hinterland lie at the easternmost edges of Zonicia. Part of Coltva since time immemorial, the region was seized by the llamas as Colthage suffered from instability. We must demand the return of Kar-Alpaka from its occupiers and bring its people under our rightful rule."
 WAR_integrate_central_zonicia:0 "Integrate Central Zonicia"
 WAR_integrate_central_zonicia_desc:0 "Incorporating the Zonician heartlands into the republic will be a daunting task, but one that will be extremely fruitful. Ensuring that the great cities of Colthage and Hippone follow our mandate will give us great legitimacy in pursuing the Zonician dream."
 WAR_panzonician_railroad:0 "The Pan-Zonician Railroad"
 WAR_panzonician_railroad_desc:0 "If we are to call ourselves the unifiers of Zonicia, we must be able to bring together this vast land. In order to achieve this, we will construct a grand railway spanning the nation, connecting our greatest cities with each other and bringing our people together like never before."
 WAR_eastern_provinces:0 "The Eastern Provinces"
 WAR_eastern_provinces_desc:0 "Located at the edges of Zonicia, Coltva and Coltdar have always been rather distinct. Integrating them into a pan-Zonician state will certainly prove challenging, especially with their history of regionalism. By granting them the autonomy offered to Zumidia, we may yet prevail in bringing our eastern cousins into the fold."
 WAR_realize_zidalids_vision:0 "Realize Zidalid's Vision"
 WAR_realize_zidalids_vision_desc:0 "After years of struggle, sacrifice, and stubborn persistence, we have done it. The dream of generations has finally been brought to fruition as all Zonicia now stands united, just as Zinuzel Zidalid first envisioned nearly 200 years ago.\n\nGlory to the Republic! Glory to Zonicia!"

 WAR_great_rebuilding:0 "The Great Rebuilding"
 WAR_great_rebuilding_desc:0 "Now that our government has stabilised, we must turn our efforts to our devastated and outdated economy. The Great Rebuilding will be Warzena's rise from the ashes. The road will be long and hard, but the grandest temples are built one stone at a time."
 WAR_worship_hippogriff_hooves:0 "Work With The Hippogriffs"
 WAR_worship_hippogriff_hooves_desc:0 "Intervention from Hippogriffia has been instrumental in keeping our realm intact. Further Hippogriff involvement would greatly hasten our modernisation efforts. Though, their influence in our country would increase considerably."
 WAR_own_industry:0 "Standing On Our Own"
 WAR_own_industry_desc:0 "We are forever grateful to our friends in Hippogriffia, but if we want to reach our true potential, then our people must stand on their own four hooves. We need more domestic production, to give them work and income. Only that way can Warzena recover."
 WAR_increase_mining:0 "Open Up Mining"
 WAR_increase_mining_desc:0 "There is a wealth of untapped minerals laying right beneath our hooves. Utilising Hippogriff expertise and logistics, we could expand our mining operations throughout the lowlands, nearly doubling our current output."
 WAR_synthetic_stuff:0 "Synthetic Resources"
 WAR_synthetic_stuff_desc:0 "Fuel is the lifeblood of a modern economy, and essential to a modern military. We lack natural oil, but there are Hippogriff refining companies that could produce enough fuel to keep things running. Perhaps we should offer them a contract?"
 WAR_address_illiteracy:0 "Address Illiteracy"
 WAR_address_illiteracy_desc:0 "Education reform has long been on our agenda. By establishing adult learning centres and expanding the reach of our public schools, we can begin to improve our citizens' literacy and numeracy."
 WAR_address_poverty:0 "Address Poverty"
 WAR_address_poverty_desc:0 "A sizeable amount of our unskilled workers are unemployed. We could prioritise creating entry-level jobs in Rebuilding projects to keep these workers above the poverty line, as well as promoting national unity."
 WAR_sever_economic_ties:0 "Sever Economic Ties"
 WAR_sever_economic_ties_desc:0 "The time has come to end the foreign aid programmes. They brought a great deal of good, but they were never long-term solutions. It will take more work, but by developing our domestic industrial sector, we can mitigate foreign influence in our economy."
 WAR_knicknacks_and_medicine:0 "Shoes, Medicine, And Candy"
 WAR_knicknacks_and_medicine_desc:0 "We have enormous stockpiles of everyday goods, like shoes, work clothing, medicine, and sugar, in Zamivgazal. Perhaps if we distributed these throughout our more poverty-stricken regions, the people would see that we have their best interests at heart."
 WAR_auction_our_souls:0 "Resource Rights For Technology"
 WAR_auction_our_souls_desc:0 "Hippogriffia is willing to provide us with technical knowledge and training in a various scientific fields. In exchange, they want temporary resource extraction charters. This could be an opportunity for us to narrow the scientific gap between our nations."

 WAR_industrialize:0 "The Industrialisation Issue"

 WAR_formalize_cooperation:0 "Formalise Cooperation"
 WAR_formalize_cooperation_desc:0 "Hippogriffia's extensive aid has earned them a great deal of goodwill from our people, many already see them as our protectors, or even allies. Perhaps, since their economic interests align with ours, it's time to take steps towards making this a reality."
 WAR_use_radar:0 "Peering Through The Aether"
 WAR_use_radar_desc:0 "Long-range detection completely changes the way we look at warfare. Our military minds are insistent on investing in this new technology, as it gives us a way to peer through the fog of war."
 WAR_modern_rifles:0 "The Modern Rifle"
 WAR_modern_rifles_desc:0 "Infantry are the backbone of any military, and the rifle is the main tool of infantry. Our muskets and breech-loaders simply will not cut it in modern warfare. Thankfully, our procurement officers have found gunsmiths capable of producing reliable bolt-action rifles. We should offer them contracts."
 WAR_tax_the_corporations:0 "Tax The Corporations"
 WAR_tax_the_corporations_desc:0 "The Great Rebuilding initiatives have been spearheaded by foreign investors and businesses, their tax breaks allowed them to build strong enterprises that expanded our industry. Now that growth has stabilised, it is time to implement a more appropriate tax policy."
 WAR_roads_and_railroads:0 "Roads And Railroads"
 WAR_roads_and_railroads_desc:0 "Our limited infrastructure has long impeded growth in our towns and rural regions. By expanding our road network and reorganising our Department of Transport, we can increase the interconnectivity of our nation, as well as preparing for future improvements."
 WAR_open_for_business:0 "Open For Business"
 WAR_open_for_business_desc:0 "Now that our infrastructure and industrial methods have been expanded, we can finally tap into the mineral resources in the lowlands. These mines will give us many of the materials we need to maintain a modern military and economy."
 WAR_rebuilding_complete:0 "The Rebuilding Complete"
 WAR_rebuilding_complete_desc:0 "It has been a long and arduous path, but thanks to our efforts, we have taken the rubble that the Storm King left behind and built it into a nation. Now we stand proud, for our children will grow up in a new, modern nation."

 WAR_dealing_with_CAMO:0 "Cleaning The Mess"
 WAR_dealing_with_CAMO_desc:0 "Although the main body of resistance has been dealt with, the agents of discord remain active. Many elements that were kept in check by CAMO leadership have grown bolder and even more radical, which has not aided the situation."
 WAR_find_the_socialists:0 "Purge The Radicals"

 WAR_find_the_nonaligned:0 "Flush Out The Remnants"
 WAR_find_the_nonaligned_desc:0 "The remaining leaders of CAMO have gone into hiding, but they cannot escape us forever. They must be hunted down and pacified, to prevent them from reclaiming their lost momentum."

 WAR_intelligence_funds:0 "Intelligence Funds"

 WAR_the_storm_king_problem:0 "The Elephant In The Room"
 WAR_the_storm_king_problem_desc:0 "Despite our attempts to tiptoe around it, it is blatantly clear that we must face our fears and address the phantom menace that has hung over Warzena since 1005."
 WAR_peace_at_home:0 "Peace at Home..."

 WAR_cowards_no_longer_desc:0 "When the Storm King attacked, we tried to fight back, but our fear was too strong and we cowered like chickens before his approaching armada.

 WAR_traitors_and_lunatics_desc:0 "There is no doubt that the greatest threat Warzena currently faces is the one posed by the brooding denizens of Chiropterra.

 WAR_refit_defenses_desc:0 "Prior Warzenan kings had built several rudimentary defensive structures across the country, but they have since fallen into disarray and the few that are still functional would be woefully incapable of impeding an enemy advance.

 WAR_reach_out_to_zarantia_desc:0 "Warzena's current standing with Zarantia can be described as tenuous at best, as the Warzenans and Imazeebs have butted heads several times during the past century.

 WAR_tobuck_resistance:0 "The Tobuckian Resistance"
 WAR_tobuck_resistance_desc:0 "Although Tobuck was never particularly fond of our rule, they despise their current occupiers even more.

 WAR_border_fortifications_desc:0 "Even if we do not have a long history of cooperation, Hippogriffia has nevertheless become one of Warzena's principal allies, thanks in no small part to the aid offered following the Storm King's defeat. It would be wise to maintain these newly forged bonds, as they may prove useful sooner rather than later."
 WAR_tank_project:0 "Deepen Our Bonds"
 WAR_tank_project_desc:0 "With the situation having stabilized and the country returned to relative peace, it is an opportune moment to expand our relationship with the hippogriffs beyond that of simple philanthropy.

 WAR_joint_training_exercises_real_desc:0 "The Hippogriffian armed forces, although not the most elite fighting force in the world, are still leagues beyond anything Warzena's military can offer.

 WAR_roads_from_seas_desc:0 "Along with much of its consumer goods, Warzena imports nearly a quarter of its military equipment from Hippogriffia. Ensuring the safe transport of these goods is of the utmost importance.

 WAR_matter_of_tobuck:0 "The Spoils Of War"
 WAR_matter_of_tobuck_desc:0 "The defeat of Chiropterra and her allies, although cause for much celebration, has also opened several questions, namely concerning the occupied territories.

 WAR_the_past_avenged_desc:0 "After a millennia of ceaseless raids and terror, the Chiropterran threat has finally been neutered. As the post-victory euphoria swells and recedes, we must put down our arms and build a new peace. And the first step in that process is deciding the fate of the Chiropterrans now living within our borders, to ensure that the horrors of the past are never repeated."
 WAR_trans_warzenan_railway:0 "A Trans-Warzenan Railway"
 WAR_trans_warzenan_railway_desc:0 "Although our heartlands are well connected by rail, the same cannot be said for our new acquisitions. Their isolation from our network prevents us from fully integrating them into the realm and could potentially result in supply shortages or worse. As such, the King has proposed the construction of a new railway that would span the entirety of the country and unite our kingdom."
 WAR_old_bonds_reforged:0 "Old Bonds Reforged"
 WAR_old_bonds_reforged_desc:0 "With the cessation of conflict in the region, the King has launched an ambitious diplomatic program, aimed at securing friendly relations with our neighbors.

 WAR_invest_in_new_provinces:0 "Invest in the New Provinces"
 WAR_invest_in_new_provinces_desc:0 "Following the defeat of Chiropterra, we occupied a significant part of their country. Unsurprisingly, this has quickly become a problem, as our new subjects are very hostile to us and rebuke any attempts at peace or cooperation. If we are to rebuild our new lands and incorporate their denizens, we must make a concerted effort to bridge the gap between our peoples."
 WAR_treaty_of_everlasting_friendship:0 "Treaty of Everlasting Friendship"
 WAR_treaty_of_everlasting_friendship_desc:0 "If recent events have proved anything, it is that the hippogriffs are invaluable allies of Warzena.

Now, our ambassadors will meet with the hippogriffs to sign a historic treaty that will preserve our people's friendship for all eternity!"
 WAR_great_port_again:0 "A Great Port Once More"
 WAR_great_port_again_desc:0 "The port of Miharzehir was once the pride of Warzena and our gate to the world. However, the rule of the false Tobuckian republic and the subsequent Chiropterran occupation have left it as a shadow of its former self. With the restoration of our rightful rule, we must do right by our subjects and restore Miharzehir to its rightful place as our greatest port."
 WAR_a_bright_future:0 "A Bright Future"
 WAR_a_bright_future_desc:0 "After the Storm King devastated Warzena, many believed that there was no hope left, that the country was destined for a future of destitution and misery. But Barekzamal refused to give up and, despite all the challenges hurled at him, he has persevered and now Warzena is thriving like never before. We may have endured great suffering, but our foals will know only of joy."
 WAR_an_eternal_peace:0 "An Eternal Peace"
 WAR_an_eternal_peace_desc:0 "A few years ago, North Zebrica was a powderkeg, ready to blow from the tiniest spark. And it did. But from the ashes of that explosion, a new peace has blossomed.

We will ensure that the next generation never has to pick up arms, nor perish in some wretched trench far from home."
 WAR_a_new_day:0 "A New Day"
 WAR_a_new_day_desc:0 "If you told someone a decade ago that Warzena would be a shining beacon of affluence, they would've laughed or denied it. And yet, it's the truth. Now, in this age of unprecedented peace and prosperity, Warzena is preparing to thank the zebra who worked so tirelessly for it, King Barekzamal. But before he can join the festivities, there's someone he needs to talk to first."

 WAR_resistance_funds:0 "Fund The Resistance"

 WAR_warzenan_military_desc:0 "Thanks in large part to our isolationist past, our military has not seen much improvement since the days of the Quaggatai. As a result, it lags woefully behind the forces of our neighbors. If we are to have a fighting chance in the upcoming struggle, we must invest in our military before it is too late."
 WAR_backbone_of_army:0 "The Backbone of the Army"
 WAR_backbone_of_army_desc:0 "The army, the largest component of the military and the primary defender of the nation, is currently hindered by a crippling crutch. The majority of the weapons our troops have access to are outdated and barely functioning, at best. Arms are the foundation on which a good army is built, and ours must be up to par if we want our army to have any semblance of efficacy."
 WAR_backbone_of_navy:0 "The Backbone of the Navy"
 WAR_backbone_of_navy_desc:0 "Although not as powerful as it once was, the Warzenan Navy is still the guardian of our waters, protecting merchants and allowing them to safely engage in trade. It is crucial that we look into improving our screens, so that our navy may continue to protect our shores."
 WAR_destroyer_construction:0 "Modernize Destroyers"
 WAR_destroyer_construction_desc:0 "For much of our modern history, destroyers have composed the bulk of the Warzenan Navy's tonnage. Even today, they form the majority of our fleet. Unfortunately, we have not been able to devote enough resources to keep them up to snuff, leaving our fleet burdened by obsolete ships. This must be addressed as soon as possible if we wish to continue fielding an effective navy."
 WAR_submarine_construction:0 "Undersea Blockade"
 WAR_submarine_construction_desc:0 "As technology advances and naval warfare evolves, it has become more apparent than ever that submarines are a crucial lynchpin of modern marine combat. Able to strike at enemy convoys and vessels from out of sight, investing into a submarine flotilla is crucial for guaranteeing our future success at sea."
 WAR_more_dockyards:0 "Increase Naval Output"
 WAR_more_dockyards_desc:0 "Although we have managed to improve the quality of our navy in recent years, those efforts will all be in vain if we have no means of actually building new models and retrofitting obsolete ones. As such, it is prudent that we expand our naval production via the construction of new dockyards."
 WAR_mine_warfare:0 "Mine Warfare"
 WAR_mine_warfare_desc:0 "The harsh truth is that our navy stands no chance in conventional open combat. In order to make up for this, we should invest into more furtive methods of securing victory.

 WAR_CAS_experiment:0 "Experiment with CAS"
 WAR_CAS_experiment_desc:0 "While our fighters clear the air of enemy aircraft, we must also actively support our troops fighting on the ground. By developing new aircraft models capable of supporting our army in ground operations, we can greatly increase their chance of victory."
 WAR_tactical_bomber_tests:0 "Testing Tactical Bombers"
 WAR_tactical_bomber_tests_desc:0 "While our air force is capable of fighting on the front itself, it does not currently possess the means to operate behind enemy lines.

 WAR_first_battleships:0 "The First Battleships"
 WAR_first_battleships_desc:0 "With the revitalization of our military, many have begun to wonder if it is time to develop our navy into a true high seas fleet by building a flotilla of capital ships. Although they were seen as impractical and expensive for the longest time, perhaps it is time for us to finally join the other great naval powers of the world with our own battleships."
 WAR_backbone_of_airforce:0 "The Backbone of the Airforce"
 WAR_backbone_of_airforce_desc:0 "Not as deep-rooted as the army or the navy, our airforce is token at best, and would barely be capable of guarding our skies. We must promote the development of new fighter plane models so that our air force may more capably defend the nation from aerial assault."
 WAR_doctrinal_advancements:0 "Doctrinal Advancements"
 WAR_doctrinal_advancements_desc:0 "Equipment and ponypower are only half the equation for a successful military. To field a truly effective fighting force, one must combine quality equipment and well trained troops with ideal doctrine, without which the former are completely useless. As such, we must pursue the development of solid military doctrines so that our forces will fight at their best."
 WAR_new_artillery:0 "New Artillery Types"
 WAR_new_artillery_desc:0 "Artillery has advanced much since the days of simple gunpowder cannons. Unfortunately, our military seems to have slept on this development, and our forces are now desperately lacking in firepower.

 WAR_naval_bombers:0 "Naval Bombers"
 WAR_naval_bombers_desc:0 "With our limited resources, and even more limited fuel reserves, it is clear that we cannot win in conventional naval warfare.

We shall design aircraft capable of operating over water and dealing hefty damage to naval vessels in order to guarantee victory at sea."
 WAR_rapid_heavy_industry:0 "Rapid Heavy Industry"
 WAR_rapid_heavy_industry_desc:0 "Our current production rates are simply not sufficient enough to deal with the demands of a proper modern military.

Our best shot at achieving this is to swiftly construct new industrial developments that will augment our military production."
 WAR_supporting_army:0 "Supporting the Army"
 WAR_supporting_army_desc:0 "An army can not fight on an empty stomach, nor can soldiers fight without bandages and communication. We must make sure that our troops are always well supplied with the most advanced support equipment available to us."
 WAR_mechanized_spear:0 "Mechanized Spear"
 WAR_mechanized_spear_desc:0 "Mechanized vehicles are an excellent way to augment our military's fighting capabilities, since they are more maneuverable than tanks, but are better defended than normal trucks, and investing in them will prove to be a great boon for our troops."
 WAR_motorizing_logistics:0 "Motorizing Logistics"
 WAR_motorizing_logistics_desc:0 "Logistics are crucial for guaranteeing the success of our army, and we can never allow them to fall behind. Thus, we must ensure the steady and rapid flow of supplies to the front by employing trucks in supply convoys, as their speed will prove very useful in the rapid delivery of vital supplies."
 WAR_tank_experiment:0 "The Tank Experiment"
 WAR_tank_experiment_desc:0 "Although not particularly viable for us, it may still be prudent to dedicate some resources into tank research. These armored vehicles are perfect for fending off enemy attacks, especially if they can not pierce them, which is highly useful for our small army."
 WAR_seize_trains:0 "Seize Trains"
 WAR_seize_trains_desc:0 "Trains are critical for ensuring the smooth flow of material to the front, and it is apparent that our production levels are falling short of demand. As messy as it may be, it is necessary for us to seize some civilian trains in order to bolster our supply network."
 WAR_army_reborn:0 "The Army Reborn"
 WAR_army_reborn_desc:0 "After years of effort and spending, it has finally paid off. Our army, once one of the worst in North Zebrica, has been able to catch up and establish itself as a true modern military, capable of engaging in today's industrialized warfare."

 WAR_find_crystals_desc:0 "In recent years, more and more applications for magical crystals have been discovered.

 WAR_true_bombers:0 "Develop True Bombers"
 WAR_true_bombers_desc:0 "While we have worked to keep our fighter models up to date, the same can not be said for our bombers, which, in their current state, could be considered experimental, at best.

 WAR_atomic_goals:0 "Atomic Aims"
 WAR_atomic_goals_desc:0 "As more and more research has been done on crystals, combined with new discoveries in physics, many have begun to theorize of the possibility of a great crystal-nuclear weapon.

This soon culminated in the formation of the Coalition of Anti-Monarchy Organizations (CAMO), an underground resistance movement that seeks to overthrow the monarchy and completely reshape Warzena. The fallout of the Storm King's invasion has served to further stir up the already volatile political climate, as discontent with the ruling system has grown to levels heretofore unheard of and more people are becoming disillusioned with the current state of affairs, swelling CAMO's ranks and bolstering the organization's support network."

 WAR_devastated_economy:0 "Devastated Economy"
 WAR_devastated_economy_desc:0 "When Warzena broke free of Quaggatai rule, it found itself in a precarious position. The ancient trade route from Maregypt, that had once passed through Warzena to reach the great cities of Zonicia, had been rendered obsolete by the invention of new ships that could travel vast distances by sea. This left Warzena stripped of its economic lifeblood and the economy soon began to falter. The construction of the Second Temple in the 850s pushed the already unsteady economy to its limits, kickstarting 150 years of economic downturn and stagnation. The situation continued to worsen as succeeding rulers were unable to handle the issue, further exacerbated by the loss of Tobuck in 956. Although the start of the 11th century seemed to promise a reversal of the kingdom's fortunes, the Storm King's invasion shattered those hopes and has left the economy in complete freefall.

 warzena.1.d:0 "A powerful hurricane glanced off the edge of our coastline. Inland flooding led to many deaths, and our roads lie buried in mud."
 warzena.1.a:0 "That's horrible."
 warzena.2.t:0 "A Nation Paralyzed"
 warzena.2.d:0 "The last 200 years have not been kind to Warzena.\n\nAlthough its liberation from the Quaggatai seemed to promise a return to its ancient status quo of isolation and prosperity, fate had other plans for the little kingdom. With the disappearance of the trade route that had run through it, the economy was left crippled and any attempts at reforms were only mildly successful, at best. Meanwhile, the Imazeeb, infuriated by taxes imposed on goods passing through Warzenan ports, took the opportunity to seize the port of Tobuck for themselves, dealing another hefty blow to the economy. During the latter half of the 10th century, the nation languished under a string of negligent and incompetent kings, whose advisors only sought to enrich themselves. This caused anti-monarchist sentiment to fester, as calls for reform were ignored, and its proponents penalized, culminating in the formation of the Coalition of Anti-Monarchy Organizations, or CAMO for short, in the late 970s.\n\nWhen Zamaliahon XVI came to the throne, it seemed that things were finally looking up for Warzena. Under his leadership, the economy's decline began to slow, while new industries began to take root. Many began to wonder if Warzena would finally be able to get back on its legs. Unfortunately, they wouldn't get to find out as, in 1005, the Storm King attacked. His vast armada obliterated the kingdom's meager defenses, and soon, he had seized control of the country. The Second Temple was stripped of its valuables and the structure destroyed afterwards. The king was killed during a raid on the Royal Palace, seemingly snuffing out the country's last hope.\n\nThe conqueror would be slain only a few months later at the fateful battle of Ain Trotgourait, liberating the countless peoples that he had subjugated. But the country was now in ruins. Barekzamal VII, the late king's brother, was never meant to rule, and his inexperience has made the nation's problems all the more glaring. The economy is clinging on to life with Hippogriffian aid, but no one knows how long it can last like this. Zamivgazal lies in ruins, along with many parts of the countryside, and national morale is at an all-time low. All the while, CAMO has grown more popular than ever, as countless commoners flock to their cause, which promises a solution to the country's woes. Either way, it would take a miracle to heal this broken nation, and many are unsure if it can be done."
 warzena.2.a:0 "May Zal and Zanit protect us in these trying times."
 warzena.3.t:0 "The Road Ahead"
 warzena.3.d:0 "The country is currently plagued by countless maladies, ranging from widespread economic downturn to local food shortages. The nation's cities are littered with rubble and crowded with the destitute, while the countryside is marred by busted roads and fields left fallow.\n\nIn order to alleviate this, the King's advisors have proposed a series of measures that would promote general recovery, with an emphasis on restoring the nation's urban centers and encouraging industrial development. Some in the court raised concerns about the proposal being too focused on the cities, and too neglectful of rural areas. After some heated debate, it was eventually passed to the King, who just barely managed to convince the dissenters that revitalizing the industrial sector was critical for long-term recovery, but made sure to incorporate extra provisions for rural recovery nonetheless.\n\nSimultaneously, CAMO's leaders have come up with a plan of their own to help reverse the nation's plight. Their efforts are on a smaller scale than anything the King could do, but their dedication is all that matters. Their main focus is the revitalization of their supporter base in the countryside, where CAMO members have been sent to assist in the reparation of local infrastructure and promote the replanting of fields so that food can make its way towards their urban allies. Although the plan is somewhat crude, with some more ambitious elements having been cut due to compromise, the organization's leaders are able to agree on it, and it will hopefully serve them well in garnering support for their cause.\n\nWith both plans being put into effect, ultimately, only one can truly capture the attention of the nation. It soon becomes clear that the more influential of the two was..."
 warzena.3.a:0 "...the Royal Court's recovery measures."
 warzena.3.b:0 "...CAMO's grassroots efforts."
 warzena.4.t:0 "The Challenges That Await Us"
 warzena.4.d:0 "Reversing the nation's fortunes is going to be by no means easy. It will be an uphill battle from start to finish, something both the King and CAMO are quite aware of.\n\nTo smooth over the process of recovery, the Royal Court has suggested passing further economic reforms in order to rejuvenate the economy. More specifically, their proposal calls for investments into entrepreneurial ventures in order to stimulate the economy with new jobs and increased production. The King also managed to introduce a stipulation for providing money to those that were hit hardest, such as laborers and artisans, so that they can contribute to the economy, but also to quell the growing tide of unrest by placating the people.\n\nCAMO's efforts are much more focused, involving a series of rallies in order to improve morale, as well as gatherings where commoners can mingle and forge strong bonds of community in order to overcome the lingering trauma from 1005. Meanwhile, CAMO's wealthier members will use their connections to sympathetic elites, as well as their own coffers, to provide for those suffering the most so that they can hopefully make their way out of poverty and achieve a comfortable standard of living.\n\nThe times ahead are challenging, but hard work is always rewarded, and in the end..."
 warzena.4.a:0 "...the royal stimulus is successful."
 warzena.4.b:0 "...CAMO's cooperation pulls through."
 warzena.5.t:0 "Bandaging The Wounds"
 warzena.5.d:0 "As is well known to every Warzenan, the economy is in a dire state, with thousands left without work or access to basic necessities. Hippogriffian aid is providing a vital lifeline, but it isn't universally well-received, despite the empirical benefits.\n\nThe Royal Court, and the King in particular, hope to reach out to the hippogriffs in order to secure more aid. Although it carries the risk of rejection, the King is confident that they can win over the hippogriffs and secure more much-needed construction materials and advisors.\n\nCAMO hopes to lessen the nation's reliance on the hippogriffs, believing it to be an unnecessary crutch. The head of the Warzenan Republican League, Itthozamal Ankeper, although not an anti-hippogriff himself, does believe that reducing the nation's reliance on them as early as possible is crucial towards a proper economic recovery and securing the future health of the economy. To that end, he has proposed a series of investment and reconstruction efforts in order to ease local economies and restore certain parts of the country to pre-Storm King productivity, which will be achieved by means of the WRL's, and his personal, connections to more liberal entrepreneurs in the country.\n\nAfter just a few weeks, the economy has shown signs of recovery, thanks in large part to..."
 warzena.5.a:0 "...the King's talks with the hippogriffs."
 warzena.5.b:0 "...Ankeper's localized initiatives."
 warzena.6.t:0 "The People's Hearts"
 warzena.6.d:0 "The Storm King's invasion has left the nation scarred, both physically and figuratively, with the latter being especially damaging. The people have been demoralized, and the whole nation is reeling from the trauma.\n\nThe king is not the most popular figure, and many blame him for the country's problems. Even so, he isn't as universally despised as his father or grandfather, and he has enough tact and charm to please most people he meets. Although the Royal Court is somewhat hesitant about it, the king believes that the best way to restore faith in the crown is to mingle with the public and make himself more presentable.\n\nBennoam Shimzel, leader of the ultranationalist Hazrumenian Social Nationalist Party, is well regarded for his oratory skills, despite his more radical tendencies, while his literary background offers a pleasant eloquence to his diction that is unmatched by any of his peers. As such, he intends to host a series of rallies in order to drive support for CAMO's cause, and potentially his own party as well. CAMO's success hinges on popular support, and if they don't secure it as quickly as possible, Warzena may be forced to languish under the yoke of monarchist oppression for another two millennia.\n\nWhoever controls the people's hearts ultimately controls the nation, and by the end..."
 warzena.6.a:0 "...the King has won the people over."
 warzena.6.b:0 "...Shimzel's words capture their spirits."
 warzena.7.t:0 "The Lay Of The Land"
 warzena.7.d:0 "Following an emergency survey, the damage done to the nation has become clear. The nation's cities have been damaged extensively, with large swathes of buildings reduced to rubble, forcing hundreds onto the streets. The nascent industrial sector has been strangled in its crib, while several local institutions have collapsed. Things aren't any better in the countryside, where acres of farmland were either razed or left to fallow, while thousands of farmers were forced to relocate to the cities, overloading the already overburdened relief infrastructure.\n\nThe King hopes to improve the situation by subsidizing farmers and encouraging migration into the country in order to repopulate it so that agricultural production can be increased. The hope is that, by providing housing and food security, he can stabilize the realm and ease dissent.\n\nCAMO's plans are equally as ambitious, with proposals to fund new industrial operations being spearheaded by Zaniiaton, the young leader of the Warzenan Communist Party. By providing additional work for the nation's proletariat, she hopes to improve their quality of life, while also using it as a testing ground for her ideology.\n\nBoth efforts are ambitious, and each side is hedging their bets, but eventually..."
 warzena.7.a:0 "...the King's rural gamble pays off."
 warzena.7.b:0 "...Zaniiaton's industrial initiative bears fruit."
 warzena.8.t:0 "A Crucial Hour"
 warzena.8.d:0 "#TODO - This event is getting a massive overhaul to imbue Warzena with a stronger narrative, as well as to make it more fleshed out in general to meet EaW standards. Describe how, despite years of tension and simmering discontent, the king has managed to placate enough of the population to avoid disaster and remain on the throne. This doesn't have to be too lengthy, but enough to capture both how close he got to losing it all and the optimism that his steadily-growing competence is inspiring. Finish the event by mentioning an advisor bringing a report to the king regarding suspected anti-monarchist elements, which the king orders to be investigated with the utmost urgency and extreme caution."

 war_alt.8.t:0 "A Crucial Hour"
 war_alt.8.d:0 "#TODO - This event will focus on the actual CAMO coup and how each major leader within it plays their part to pull it off. The opening paragraph can be pretty short, discussing how the coup opens. You can take some liberties, but the general gist should be that CAMO is trying to do this as quickly and with as little bloodshed as possible. Then have 3 paragraphs, one for each leader and their respective faction. Ideally, the paragraph order goes: Zaniiaton, Ankeper, Shimzel. The first paragraph would thus discuss Zaniiaton and the WCP blocking roads to the Royal Palace and ensuring nobles and soldiers are not able to act. The next paragraph would discuss Ankeper and the WRL activating their contacts - sympathetic nobles and merchants - to make the Palace as vulnerable as possible and to ensure the King is in a position to be captured without a fight. Then, the third paragraph would have Shimzel and the HSNP securing the outside of the Palace proper with the aid of their allies in the military. The last paragraph(s) would then discuss a mix of CAMO forces entering the palace and securing the King and major royal officials swiftly and without any deaths (if you want, you can mention briefly that there were only a few injured between both the CAMO members and the royal guards), before wrapping up with the people of Zamivgazal waking up to news of the king's abdication and the establishment of an interim government by CAMO leadership."

This event should serve as an addendum to event 8, with an emphasis on what the King now plans to do to begin addressing the issues that continue to plague the nation. As a reminder, the events prior involved the institution of very temporary measures to keep things afloat, with event 8 acting to cap that chain with the king cementing his position. Now he must look to the future and begin planning real changes and long-term solutions to the country's problems."

 warzena.10.d:0 "Every passing moment drew all of Warzena closer to the nation's future, from its every span of ancient homeland to every denizen to its lone king pacing to and fro in his chamber. The stars and moon had already begun to illuminate the night and all but the busiest of Warzena had retired to sleep, yet still the zebra remained awake.\n\nKing Barekzamal heaved a sigh and gazed over the luminant rooftops of Zamivgazal from his window. Everyzebra had done so much to restore Warzena, and still so much more remained. Though soon, perhaps admittedly even a bit too soon, the nation would be led unto its future with him officially taking the reins. Was this what his late brother felt when he had ascended the throne? All the kings and queens before?\n\nKing Barekzamal smiled. To say all of this was daunting was the understatement of history.\n\nFinally, there was a knock on the door, and Barekzamal called for the invited guests. Quietly, the zebra wondered if he should've adorned something more regal than a modestly fashioned nightgown, but worries soon vanished upon the sight of the small contingent of priests entering and bowing with the barest of ornate robes.\n\n"Good evening, your highness," the head priest spoke, "forgive our lack of proper apparel, we were informed your request was urgent."\n\nThe king returned the courtesy in kind. "Of course, so as long as you all forgive mine."\n\nHe tactfully waited a few moments for their smiles to sink in before bowing his head. "I have summoned all of you here because Warzena will soon embark upon its future, and what lies ahead will undoubtedly determine the destiny of our kingdom. This has troubled me throughout, and I wish, well, to pray, for our future and Warzena's."\n\nOne of the priests spoke nonchalantly. "Hmm, since we're already up, we might as well."\n\nBarekzamal gave a laugh of approval before any of the more stringent priests admonished the remark, moving to begin the impromptu prayer session." #Ardent Custodian

 warzena.15.d:0 "In recent years, close cooperation between our countries has allowed Hippogriffian companies to establish themselves in Warzena. Encouraged by tax breaks and subsidies, they eagerly moved into the kingdom, which allowed its ailing economy to recover. Following the integration of Warzena into our sphere, the companies have only grown more, but now it seems that there is a bit of friction. Warzena has recently lodged a formal request to impose taxes on the Hippogriffian corporations operating in their country.\n\nThey claim that, with the recovery of their economy, they no longer need to encourage growth via subsidies and must implement sensible tax policies. The corporations have protested in turn, saying that this would harm business and labelling it a betrayal. It is quite impudent of a satellite state to make such demands, and it would be negligent to indulge them. However, Warzena needs to strengthen its economy, and allowing it to properly tax the corporations would allow it to do so. After all, is strengthening our allies not one of our most important priorities?"

 warzena.20.d:0 "Tension had been building in Warzena ever since the king's controversial decision to submit to Aris. While the Warzenans have since enjoyed unprecedented prosperity and privilege within the Hippogriff Hegemony, personal freedoms are nonexistant and independence is a bad joke. Fed a steady diet of propaganda about Warzenan superiority to other zebras by Arisian media, many ironically flocked to the anti-hippogriff CAMO ultranationalists.\n\nThese contradictions were bound to explode. [WAR.GetLeader], though little more than a figurehead, had become a symbol of both harmonist intransigence and hippogriff collaboration. On a hot day in a visit to a small village, three shots rang out.\n\nThe King was only hit once, but it was days before anycreature knew he would survive his wound, and weeks before he was let out of the Arisian hospital he was treated at. When he returned, he no longer recognized Warzena.\n\nOutrage at the would-be assassin and other CAMO ultranationalists was channeled into a ruthless purge. Family members denounced each other for anti-Arisian activity. The syncretist religious movement promoted by the hippogriffs -which saw the Warzenan and hippogriff gods as one and the same- finally gained traction, as service after service was held praying for the King.\n\n[WAR.GetLeader] had been transformed into a symbol of faith and national endurance, but in the interests of his protection he was not to leave the palace again except under heavy hippogriff guard."

The King probably didn't draft it, but whoever did was a zebra after his own heart. He'd have to meet them, whoever they were. Still, there were practical considerations.\n\nCeding Tobuck fully to Warzenan administration was not part of his plan at all; Tobuck was to be exploited more thoroughly, rather than given the special treatment due to Warzenans. And besides, they were mostly ponies: while ceding Tobuck would bolster Warzenan pride, it could dilute their national-racial character in the long run. It might even give them ideas. Ideas of independence.\n\nOn the other claw, the Warzenans could probably handle it cheaper and more easily. Some part of Crack did want to reward this kind of thinking from his favourite subjects.

For his lack of experience as a ruler, he was very aware that there were still those who sought to undermine and treasonously subvert his authority. The members of CAMO had somehow received too many undisclosed details on his future plans for the kingdom, and as a result, were able to present commendable counterproposals. Now with him slated to officially become the head of Warzena and many of their plans rejected, Barekzamal pondered how soon until CAMO or others began considering more extreme measures, if they weren't already.\n\nThe King continued to slowly shift his gaze. His eyes were briefly met by another pair already glancing his way before their owner quickly returned their attention back to the debate between court members. Exactly how much of the royal court were for or against him? How many were indifferent? How many could be swayed and how many would need to be taken care of?\n\nThe royal zebra adjusted to a more comfortable position in his seat. A precedence would have to be made quickly and carefully. Though from what his friends had said about him before this whole kingship ordeal, King Barekzamal VII believed he had just enough charisma and amicability to take care of it; or at least to ensure the filtration started properly." #Ardent Custodian

Municipal leaders and police commissioners had arrived and they were expecting him to approve of their door-bucking campaign. Barekzamal gathered himself. He waved the messenger away while he made the slow and tenuous walk to the throne room.\n\nHe cautiously opened the doors with false confidence. The zebras of the room bowed. The king begrudgingly took a seat on the throne, his stomach turning at what was to come. Intrusive thoughts unfolded in his mind as he contemplated the situation. They had been on the brink once before. Since then, they have worked tirelessly to cure their blighted kingdom. The bleak sacrifices made in the past led them to this point. If he called the raids off, it might cascade and force them back to the edge. There was no option other than to bloody the hooves of the monarchy once more.\n\nHe delivered his decision to the small crowd.

The aroma of freshly cooking foods permeated the atmosphere, deliciously blending the scents of individual dishes into the fervent bouquet of a grandiose feast. Exuberant foals galloped in play through the lavishly decorated streets and weaved through the crowds making their way closer and closer to the capital's center. Here gathered the multitudes of Warzena, eager as ever to be present and witnessing true history in the making.\n\nThe only ones who looked less than pleased were the many guards patrolling the streets and stationed throughout the King's domicile, though if asked why, the general consensus would be because they weren't off-duty to enjoy the celebrations.\n\nAll the clamor in the central square fell into hushes and prayers at the sight of Warzena's highest priest stepping out onto the royal balcony. She soon beckoned forth and the boisterous rhythm of the royal orchestra rang out to thundering drums. With a last holy gesture, she stepped aside, and from behind stepped forth their official ruler.\n\nKing Barekzamal VII lifted a hoof and waved with a smile towards the crowd below unbridled in celebration. Despite having held the position long before today, he couldn't deny the symbolic grandeur of the coronation and all that it meant for Warzena.

In particular, the leaders of CAMO's more extreme factions have apparently become more aggressive, having been freed of the restraint of their moderate counterparts. On the one hoof, this lack of coordination is useful in preventing these elements from being able to front an effective opposition to our authority. On the other hoof however, it has made them much more cautious, which, combined with the aforementioned aggression, has made them a particularly painful thorn in our side.\n\nThe most active of the radicals are the WCP and the HSNP, the forefront of CAMO's radical left and right wing movements, respectively. Zaniiaton, head of the WCP, was one of the few CAMO members we were completely unable to trail, as she seems to blend into the countryside, like a ghost in the shadows. It seems that she has grown even more discreet, staking out careful, but effective, raids on our posts and towns. If she is not dealt with soon, unrest may begin to grow in the rural regions. Meanwhile, the HSNP's Bennoam Shimzel is a character that we have had no problem tracking, but his connections to officials have kept him safe, while his remaining followers, zealous in their devotion, have always managed to skirt him away to safety when all else failed. Should this continue, Shimzel may yet be able to regain his footing and continue to challenge our rule.\n\nMeanwhile, CAMO's other factions have not entirely disappeared either. Although Itthozamal Ankeper, former head of the WRL, has been dealt with, many of his allies have managed to escape and have since banded with other moderate elements to form the League for a Free Warzena, which has continued to operate in secret. Although not as bellicose as their erstwhile radical allies, the LFW is still a problem that will have to be dealt with, lest all our hard work is undone and our sacrifices made futile."

We are not a kingdom of land, we are a kingdom of people, and our people simply cannot be stamped out by military boots.

Many in the court hope that we can acquire more sophisticated arms blueprints in order to improve the quality of our armed forces.

These militaristic factions have been joined by a clique interested in procuring more advanced manufacturing methods in order to streamline our production lines and expand our industrial output.\n\nUltimately, it seems that we may only have the capacity to lobby for just one advancement, so we should choose with abundant discretion.

He was here for more pressing matters.\n\nAfter greeting his ministers and courtiers and settling into his seat, Barekzamal cut to the chase, "After so much struggle and bloodshed, our nation is finally at peace. However, although we have solved many of our nation's old woes, new ones are beginning to crop up. The most prominent is the animosity of...", he paused, trying to find the right words,"... our new subjects. That is why I have summoned you today. If we are to build a new peace, we must address this quickly." He was immediately beset by a flurry of suggestions as the court filled with debate. This was quickly cut short when a young stallion exclaimed, "Your Majesty, is it not obvious what we must do? We must eliminate the zealots as quickly as possible. Send in the troops and give them no mercy!"\n\nThis outcry was punctuated by several shocked gasps, hushed murmurs, and even a few nods in agreement. The room devolved into violent bickering, and Barekzamal barely managed to restore order. Facing the stallion, he said, "And why would you suggest such a thing? Should we not treat them as fairly as any subject?" The stallion replied, "Why do they deserve our kindness? They are heartless beasts, every last one of them! They abducted our people, pillaged our homes, destroyed our families. And you want to give them mercy?! I'm sorry, your Majesty, but I can't accept that."\n\nBarekzamal pondered this. Yes, the Chiropterrans hadn't been the most amicable of neighbors. But, to repay that with more malice would be short sighted, and that's not what anyone needed right now. Facing the stallion again, Barekzamal spoke, "You are right. The Chiropterrans have given us much pain over the centuries. But to return with just as much hatred would only make things worse. I feel that, if we want to truly be at peace, we must let go of that hate." Turning back to the court, he spoke, "I propose that we demilitarize the nation, to ease the tension. Then, we can bring about a true peace for all of our peoples". After a few seconds of stunned silence, the court quickly erupted into a chorus of cheers and applause.

Fortunately, they had agreed, and now, he was determined to make this work, especially with the Zarantians, with whom relations were already tense. He had declined to participate in the actual meeting, believing that his presence would create undue pressure on the diplomats. As the last of the attendees settled in, Barekzamal could only wait and hope that it went well.\n\nAfter several excruciating hours, Barekzamal was surprised to see a secretary at the door beckoning him to enter. After making his way to the meeting room, he was suddenly met with cheers and well wishes from the foreign delegations. Taken aback, he was led to a seat, and a young Warzenan ambassador summarized the meeting's results to him. What she told him made him happier than he could ever imagine. Not only had his diplomats been able to reach a rapport with the delegations, but they had also managed to secure several lucrative international trading agreements and, to top it off, official treatices of non-aggression!

Elated beyond measure, Barekzamal spent the rest of the afternoon engaged in eager conversation with the diplomats, and personally bade them farewell as they departed.

 warzena.40.d:0 "As the Warzenan mission pulled into Batsby, they were pleasantly surprised that their convoy had not been immediately fired upon by angry ex-Legionnaires. Of course, the fact that they could only see a dozen creatures gathered in the town square was still cause for concern, so their guards remained on high alert.\n\nThe head of the mission, a middle-aged zebra mare named Gerzanit, stepped out of the truck first, and slowly approached the old and scarred thestral stallion at the head of the group. She barely had a chance to speak before being met by his hostility, as the elder proceeded to steadily work his way through a truly splendid catalogue of insults, where 'old hag' had been only the start, but Gerzanit stood her ground with great calm and patience. She eventually managed to defuse the situation by explaining that they were there in a gesture of good faith. Her words alone had maybe not had too much of an impact, but the crates of food, clothing, fuel, and tools, as well as a large collection of toys for the children, had helped a lot. It had, however, taken Gerzanit dismissing her soldiers as a sign of trust to make the curmudgeonly old thestral listen.\n\nOnce that was sorted, she directed the rest of the mission to begin distributing goods to the group, who were pleased by the treats the mission had brought. The sound of lively chatter drew out the rest of the residents, who had hidden before the mission arrived. An earth pony filly, who had noticed the toys earlier, timidly approached the stallion passing them out, and pointed to a small plush doll.\n\n"C-c-could I-i have that one? M-my sister r-really likes those."\n\n"Sure kiddo, here you go." Muttering a brief thanks, the filly nervously dashed away. The stallion was soon swarmed by dozens of foals, all begging for toys. As the mission continued to mingle with the townsfolk, Gerzanit was very pleased to see everyone getting along, especially so when she spotted the old thestral hesitantly approach the mare handing out sweets."

 warzena.41.d:0 "Askalion's central station was buzzing with activity as trains loaded with zebra, hippogriff, and seapony dignitaries continued to pull in. The station had been connected to the Seaquestrian rail network only a few years ago, but it was already the busiest rail line in the whole country. The arriving dignitaries made their way through the illuminated streets of the city, adorned with banners welcoming the Hippogriffians, and full of friendly residents, who eagerly gave them gifts and warm welcomes.\n\nThe last of the dignitaries finally arrived at a grand banquet hall, built especially for the occasion, and fitted with special entrances to accommodate any seaponies arriving by fin. After everyone had settled in, the meeting began, as diplomats from both sides worked together to forge a new treaty, one that would ensure that the alliance between Warzena and Hippogriffia would last for centuries to come. Despite some minor disagreements over trade policy, the meeting went off without a hitch. After the last few details were ironed out, the meeting was adjourned, and the press was invited inside to broadcast the signing of the treaty to the people of both nations.\n\nWith the official business out of the way, the tables were rearranged and filled with all sorts of delicious dishes, ranging from traditional Warzenan cuisine to classic Hippogriffian staples. An orchestral band opened with the national anthems of both kingdoms, before filling the hall with the sound of classical tunes from the region. As the night went on, the dignitaries danced and conversed with each other, and the event concluded with everyone in high spirits. When the trains departed the following morning, the dignitaries were given a heartfelt farewell from the townsfolk, and the aura of good feelings remained over Askalion for the next week."

The stalls were packed to the brim with all sorts of goods, both local and exotic, and surrounded by colorful tarps and posterboards promising great bargains. Nearby, construction was underway on a mixed-use building, which would accommodate shops on its ground floor, and plenty of affordable housing above. This was the first of its kind in the whole country, and people were eager to see what would come of it. There were even rumors that foreign companies had purchased lots to secure an opening into the burgeoning Warzenan market.\n\nAmidst all the commotion of the city center, the people go about their day, taking lunch breaks, meeting friends, or just enjoying the scenery. The whole view is rather idyllic, which makes it all the more unbelievable that a little over five years ago, this place looked like a ghost town. But now the streets, once full of nothing but rubble and despair, are alive with smiles and hope. Never before has Zamivgazal prospered this much, nor its denizens been so happy. And if one were to ask the reason for their joy, no doubt they would say, "Gods praise the King."\n\nEven if Barekzamal himself won't say it, the people are more than happy to laud his reform efforts and shrewd leadership as the primary reasons for Warzena's prosperity and continued survival. Some even call him the greatest king Warzena has ever seen. The nation loves its king, and it seems that the gods do as well. It seems that peaceful moments such as these are due to become just another afternoon in Zamivgazal."

This conference, one of the largest of its kind to ever be hosted in the country, and possibly the whole region, was the amalgamation of nearly a year of hard work. Gathered in this giant hall near the heart of Zamivgazal, purpose-built for the occasion, were dozens of ambassadors, diplomats, and assorted officials from across North Zebrica. Among them were diplomatic legations from Hippogriffia, Colthage, and Chiropterra, alongside representatives for Zarantia and Zumidia, and even emissaries from the Quaggatai and isolationist Macawia.\n\nDespite their differences, those present were united by one overarching purpose: the creation of a true peace in North Zebrica. For the past decade, the region had been subjected to catastrophe, bloodshed, and tragedy, something everyone present was acutely aware of. The meeting opened with a speech from King Barekzamal himself, thanking everyone for their attendance, and inviting them to let go of their grudges so that they could build a peaceful future together. After the applause died down, the conference commenced, and the hall quickly filled with the sound of deliberation and discussion, which was broken up only by speeches from delegates and breaks for meals and religious ceremonies. Eventually, after nearly three days of debate, the conference ratified a series of treatices that were to serve as the blueprint for a new age of peace and harmony in North Zebrica.\n\nAfterwards, the king delivered his concluding speech, lauding everyone for their efforts and expressing his enthusiasm for the future, which was met with raucous applause. It was followed up with an official ceremony that was broadcast across regional radio, and a lavish banquet adorned with countless local delicacies. With the conference's formal conclusion, the attendees departed with a sense of accomplishment and joy, and an air of good feelings remained over the city for weeks."

For the past few years the place had been overgrown and decrepit, but the groundskeepers, per his request, were able to salvage it after a week of hard work. As he approached his destination, Barekzamal took in the tranquil atmosphere and the beauty of the olive tree growing above the modest obelisk that he had arrived at. He carefully set down the offerings and other objects at its base and, after a quick prayer, looked up to properly face it. His eyes were drawn not to the epitaph inscribed into its marble surface, but to the name of the one it was commemorating: Zamaliahon, the Sixteenth of His Name. His late brother.\n\n"It's been a while since we last spoke, hasn't it. I've been busy lately, so I haven't had much time to spare. We hosted an international conference here recently, it was remarkable! A success beyond my wildest dreams. With this, I believe that we are one step closer to making true peace a reality. And of course, you'll be happy to hear that things are going just as well domestically. The people are thriving, poverty is basically gone, and the economy is booming. The streets are more alive than I ever remember them being. Ah, but I'm sure you don't want to hear the same old spiel again. The real reason I came here was a little more personal."\n\nBarekzamal took a breath before exclaiming, "We're having another child! Ummazanit actually found out a few months ago, but she figured telling you early would be bad luck or something. But of course, you're the first one I've told. If it's a son, we're planning to name him after you. I hope you'll like that. Regardless, we're both very happy."\n\nBarekzamal then paused, seemingly deep in thought, before beginning again, "I really do wish you were here to see all this. It's been very difficult without you, and everyday I find myself wondering how things would've happened if I hadn't lost you. How they should've happened."\n\nBarekzamal stopped to catch his breath, his voice shaky and his eyes tearing up. After a brief second, he managed to push through, "But there's no use in speculation. I'm still here, and so is the kingdom. It wasn't easy, but I've done my best to honor your legacy. I swear to you brother, I will make you proud. Just keep watching."\n\nWith that, Barekzamal performed the closing rites and bade his brother farewell. Walking towards the rising sun, he felt strangely relieved as a soft smile came upon his face."

 warzena.64.d:0 "'I'm not him,” Barekzamal thought. 'I can never be him. Brother, forgive me...I can't...'\n\nThe king buried his head in his hooves and sank from his bed to the carpet floor, his spiraling mind consumed in dreadful emotion and crippling grief. Such a display would have been more than unbecoming of a royal, much less a respectable creature, but Warzena’s morose king was alone. Utterly alone. Everyzebra around expected him to be a king akin to his late brother, yet he couldn't. He just couldn't. Warzena had lost somezebra beyond great, and all it was left with was him: a nobody. He was nothing. Always was.\n\nHis chamber door slowly opened, and his beautiful wife graced his room, cautious worry on her face.\n\n"Ummazanit," he mumbled,  "I...I-"\n\nBarekzamal wasn't sure when it happened, but soon his wife’s hooves gently swept him from the floor. With their backs against the bed and he in her embrace, the night carried on until Barekzamel could finally speak. “I miss him...I miss my brother so much. He would’ve been better for Warzena, not me. I cannot command, or be strong, or even give our people hope for a tomorrow. I am n-nothing; I can do...nothing.”\n\n“You can care,” Ummazanit said, stroking his cheek, “You can care like the clever zebra that won my heart: the same steadfast zebra who held my side when I gave birth to his son. And just like how he cares enough now to grieve and think himself unworthy for his kingdom, I know he will care enough to become the ruler we will need.”\n\n“It sounds like that zebra deserves you, not me.”\n\n“No zebra deserves me,” she chuckled, “but I am your wife still, and you are my king. You can do this.” Barekzamal finally embraced her, and the two held each other for the rest of the night."

It was enough that he had agreed to hold this assembly in the first place, as keeping up with the happenings of his kingdom was indubitably vital, but nothing would be gained if he couldn’t understand what was being said. He had been nervous to interrupt before, trying in vain to hear a stopping point in the talks, though now Barekzamel was trying his best to not let his irritation show.\n\nNot coming up with a better way to get the meeting’s attention, the king slowly raised his hoof...and nearly jumped when all eyes fell on him in silence. “I’m sorry, but is there perhaps a way you could, maybe, simplify these concepts?”\n\nOne of the economic advisors spoke, “Your Majesty?” Having already outed himself as clueless, he drew a breath and went with it—much like how he remembered his brother doing at times, “I am rather...unfamiliar with much of what has been expertly explained, unfortunately. Would it be possible to explain the main points with words that everycreature can understand?”\n\nThe economic advisors agreed and began to painstakingly try to simplify their reports, the deeply embarrassed king listening all the while, but the easier words and terms soon elicited responses and insightful statements from the non-economic advisors in attendance, and an inclusive sense of cohesion soon formed in the assembly’s discussions.\n\nMore importantly, Barekzamal was understanding more of what was being said now, and it wasn’t long until he began to politely offer possible resolutions with the many other advisors in attendance. There were still some words he didn't quite get, especially when advisors from other fields would chime in, but everything was intertwined in some way or form, and soon Barekzamal and the rest of the assembly had produced a number of conceptual solutions that could be applicable for Warzena."

 warzena.66.d:0 "The town of Zimash had been improved from its squalor of destitution prior, but Barekzamal could see the progress of national development was rather slower here than other places he had visited. Many crumbling buildings were adorned in scaffolding for repairs, but the overall effort was lacking everywhere. Likewise, the main roads and walkways could barely be considered such with how withered and perforated their surfaces were. Even most of its denizens that he had seen, in the neighborhoods and the workplaces, all carried about a near-identical rugged expression of apathy. The progress here was way too behind compared to the amount he was anticipating. What had gone wrong?\n\nHe approached a local earth pony street vendor to inquire about the changes in Zimash, and the answer came candidly.  “Yeah, much of those policies you decreed are very sound, your Majesty, but unfortunately many of them have no bearing this far out beyond the capital. And depending on what place you visit, those policies have either done very little or very much, assuming somecreatures actually do their jobs.”\n\nThe street vendor quickly backpedaled his words, “Not that you’re not doing your job, your Majesty, nocreatures I know doubt your intentions. We just wish more local officials had your heart is all.”\n\nBarekzamal glanced back at his retinue of travelers talking amongst themselves and looked around the town center again. It finally came to him: if Warzena was to change for the better, everything would need to be taken into consideration, including everycreature in its government. He couldn't just ignorantly decree the economy to fix itself. Barekzamal had a more thorough understanding of what he would need to know, starting with the components of locally-scaled developments and anti-corruption. “I will see it done.”\n\n“Of course, your Majesty, and thank you.”"

The duties which you will embark upon across North Zebrica may very well determine the future of Warzena. That being said, how many here have ever ventured outside of our country before?”\n\nTo his relief, a few hooves were raised, followed by inquiries of where. Barekzamal quickly delved into what he knew about the nations across North Zebrica based off his personal experiences. He went over everything he had learned, advocating all throughout how everything was subject to change and that they should treat his words akin to a guideline. He even explained the simplicities on how to officially conduct diplomacy in each country and how to be respectful of everything and everycreature they came across. Every bit of knowledge and more: all thanks to foreign relations.\n\n“There are differences to everything, yes, but that is what can make mutual relations so versatile and great,” Barekzamal said, now understanding more than ever how nations so foreign can build bridges together and how late in the evening it was. “I can offer more notes for everyzebra this weekend, but are there any quick questions as of now?”\n\nThe entire assembly raised a hoof.

No more was he plagued with uncertainty and timidness, but brimming with hope and charisma worthy of his people's admiration. He proclaimed of victory, he proclaimed of the sacrifices they had given and more upon the battlefields, but most importantly, Barekzamal proclaimed to everyzebra a future of hope.\n\n"Your future will be a legacy of hope for all!" the confident king proclaimed, "And here on, that future will be of Warzena!"\n\nThe royal family waved out to the deafening cheers and music filled the air once more.\n\nWhen the last bow had been delivered and they had finally retired from the balcony, Barekzamal turned to his son, who could scarcely conceal his excitement. He chuckled, “You may go to your friends now, Hannizamal.”\n\nFather and son shared a long embrace before the young colt sprinted away. Barekzamal smiled as he watched him depart, but his attention was quickly drawn to his beautiful Ummazanit, who had drawn close to nip at his neck and guide him towards their bedchamber.\n\nThe Kingdom of Warzena had not only survived, but it had conquered.

The most important thing here is to highlight how allowing the farmers to collectivize on their own, with only minimal input from state organizations like the AWC (Agricultural Workers’ Commissariat), led to a successful reorganization of farmland without harming yields. Additionally, it serves as a blueprint for the true communist vision of a stateless society, highlighting how workers are very capable of organizing themselves for the greater good. As this is a government report, feel free to mention some specific yield data (like bushels of millet or tons of papayas), and include things that the PBA feels need to be addressed. Perhaps include issues that arose from collectivization efforts, such as mismanagement of crops or something else that highlights the imperfections that emerge when implementing a radically new system.

A few party officials alongside a decent amount of people gather at Askalion to see the ex-royalty off, who board a small civilian ship in the harbor. They wave to the crowd who offer well wishes and a sincere farewell as the boat departs, with the event overall being somewhat bittersweet. While Warzena will likely fare better without its royals, they were still good people and this is reflected in the crowds who still want their king to be happy, even if he no longer has that title.

Touch on how this affects the SCGD, with some members becoming desperate enough to recommend authoritarian measures to address the slump. However, more cool-headed members pull through and convince their peers to stick to the original design and instead provide further incentives to the few sectors still doing well, causing a domino effect of inspiring others to emulate their efforts in the hopes of getting recognition.

Zonicia is starting to heal from the wounds inflicted upon it by decades of war and bourgeois oppression, and the cities are beginning to come alive with people from across the region as the revolution comes to encompass all of North Zebrica. As is standard, Zaniiaton should be mentioned somewhat in passing, albeit she should be the most active here, given her strong interest in the region. She is the one that helped to promote many efforts to bring new life into the region, as well as preparing it to become the capital of a communist Zonician state. This strong interest in the region can go as far as making her travel to the great cities herself to be directly involved in recovery and expansion efforts.

Ankeper opens by stating that the conditions were simply not right for a coup and that it would have been far too risky, instead urging everyone to continue biding their time. This strikes a nerve with both Zaniiaton and Shimzel. The former, younger and less restrained, rises and lashes out at Ankeper, calling him a coward, insisting that this was their best chance at revolution. Ankeper tries to reason with her, but he is unable to get a word in. When he continues to insist on patience, she brands him a traitor to the people and storms out, causing the rest of the WCP to do the same. Shimzel, whose expression had grown more and more grave over the course of Zaniiaton's tirade, finally speaks up. With a very cold tone, he states that he no longer has anything to gain from cooperating with other anti-monarchist groups, decrying them as inflexible fools, incapable of thinking on the fly. He then calls the HSNP to leave, and they quietly depart the meeting. The stress causes Ankeper's condition to act up, leaving him unable to say anything in return, simply sitting and watching decades of work crumble around him. His husband quickly steps in to re-organize the meeting and get everyone still present to commit to continued patience for the cause."

His early adulthood was equally pleasant as he was able to marry his beloved wife Ummazanit shortly after his brother's coronation. It seemed that everything was set for him to have an uneventful and blissful life. Unfortunately, the gods had other plans for the young prince, and in 1005, his precious world was turned upside down.\n\nAs the Storm King swept through the kingdom, Barekzamal managed to escape, but his brother was killed in the Palace by the invaders. After the conqueror was slain, Barekzamal returned to Zamivgazal a changed person. He quickly set to work, trying to keep the nation afloat. Although he had some success, for the most part, his policies were ineffective as his inexperience betrayed him. This culminated in the successful CAMO coup of 1007, which saw Barekzamal lose his throne. However, in a show of good grace, the new government allowed him to remain in the country, and even offered him an advisory role. Now, Barekzamal continues to do his best for the people of Warzena, not as their king, but as one of them."

 ### IDEAS ###
 WAR_fervent_civil_unrest:0 "Fervent Civil Unrest"
 WAR_fervent_civil_unrest_desc:0 "For the past century, Warzena has been plagued by ineffective leadership and unstable governments, resulting in general stagnation and unrest. Many activists began to clamor for change, but their calls fell on deaf ears, and they were ultimately repressed. This soon culminated in the formation of the Coalition of Anti-Monarchy Organizations (CAMO), an underground resistance movement that seeks to overthrow the monarchy and completely reshape Warzena. The fallout of the Storm King’s invasion has served to further stir up the already volatile political climate, as discontent with the ruling system has grown to levels heretofore unheard of and more people are becoming disillusioned with the current state of affairs, swelling CAMO’s ranks, and bolstering the organization’s support network."
 WAR_hippogriffian_aid:0 "Hippogriffian Aid"
 WAR_hippogriffian_aid_desc:0 "After the Storm King was defeated, Warzena was left in a dire situation, with an economy in tatters, and its capital sacked and destroyed. The hippogriffs, who had occupied Zumidia, offered to help the struggling nation. The king accepted their proposition, and for the past two years, Warzena has received advice and material aid from Hippogriffia. Although this has prevented the nation from completely collapsing, the situation still remains tenuous at best, not to mention those who are displeased with the presence of the hippogriffs and the nation’s dependence on them."
 WAR_devastated_economy:0 "Devastated Economy"
 WAR_devastated_economy_desc:0 "When Warzena broke free of Quaggatai rule, it found itself in a precarious position. The ancient trade route from Maregypt, that had once passed through Warzena to reach the great cities of Zonicia, had been rendered obsolete by the invention of new ships that could travel vast distances by sea. This left Warzena stripped of its economic lifeblood, and the economy soon began to falter. The construction of the Second Temple in the 850s pushed the already unsteady economy to its limits, kickstarting 150 years of economic downturn and stagnation. The situation continued to worsen as succeeding rulers were unable to handle the issue, further exacerbated by the loss of Tobuck in 956, which only sped up the economy’s decline. Although the start of the 11th century seemed to promise a reversal of the kingdom’s fortunes, the Storm King’s invasion shattered those hopes, and has left the economy in complete freefall. The new king is nearly at his wit’s end and underground resistance has grown to monumental levels, as people from across Warzena seek some sort of solution."

 ### DECISIONS ###
 
 ### EVENTS ###

At the same time, CAMO is preparing for a decisive strike, and is gathering further support from the populace so that it may finally overthrow the old monarchy and lead the nation forward."
 warzena.4.a:0 "The people's will shall decide the nation's fate."
 warzena.5.t:0 "A Crucial Hour"
 warzena.5.d:0 "The tension has reached a boiling point, as CAMO readies for the final strike. The king is prepared to do anything necessary to keep his throne and stop the country from falling into chaos. The entire nation waits with baited breath, and the fate of the country now rests on a knife's edge."
 warzena.5.a:0 "The clock is ticking, and the country's future hangs in the balance."

 WAR_emergency_measures:0 "Emergency Measures"
 WAR_emergency_measures_desc:0 "Although we have managed to prevent the country from collapsing outright, the situation is still tenuous at best, and without further measures, may spiral completely out of our control. Even if they are temporary, these policies will ensure that the country can keep its bearings until a more permanent solution is implemented."
 WAR_traitors_among_us:0 "The Traitors Among Us..."
 WAR_traitors_among_us_desc:0 "Although we would like to believe that the royal court can be trusted, we must accept the harsh reality that there are traitors and backstabbers among us, with even the king's closest advisors being potential impostors relaying information to our enemies."
 WAR_all_around_us:0 "...And All Around Us"
 WAR_all_around_us_desc:0 "All across the country, there is a vast network of those opposed to the monarchy, consisting of a myriad of different people, coming from different walks of life.

If the main agents of dissidence can be tracked down and neutralized, then the beast they built will surely follow."
 WAR_proper_coronation:0 "A Proper Coronation"
 WAR_proper_coronation_desc:0 "After 3 years of devastation and misery, Warzena is finally able to witness the coronation of her king.

 WAR_synthetic_stuff:0 "Synthetic Resources"
 WAR_synthetic_stuff_desc:0 "Fuel is the lifeblood of a modern economy, and essential to a modern military. We lack natural oil, but there are Hippogriff refining companies that could produce enough fuel to keep things running. Perhaps we should offer them a contract?"
 WAR_address_illiteracy:0 "Address Illiteracy"

 WAR_knicknacks_and_medicine:0 "Shoes, Medicine, and Candy"
 WAR_knicknacks_and_medicine_desc:0 "We have enormous stockpiles of everyday goods, like shoes, work clothing, medicine, and sugar, in Zamivgazal. Perhaps if we distributed these throughout our more poverty-stricken regions, the people would see that we have their best interests at heart."
 WAR_auction_our_souls:0 "Resource Rights for Technology"
 WAR_auction_our_souls_desc:0 "Hippogriffia is willing to provide us with technical knowledge and training in a various scientific fields. In exchange, they want temporary resource extraction charters. This could be an opportunity for us to narrow the scientific gap between our nations."

 WAR_invest_in_radio_desc:0 "Investing in FM Radio would not only be a boon to our military’s cohesion, but would also allow us to easily broadcast information to our rural citizens."
 WAR_industrialize:0 "The Industrialisation Issue"
 WAR_industrialize_desc:0 "Even before the Storm King's wars, our nation was woefully lacking in machinery, instead reliant on cottage industries and outdated factories. Under our new plan, we can restructure our industry to properly utilise machine tools and modern production line methods."
 WAR_new_gun_factories:0 "New Gun Factories"

 WAR_formalize_cooperation:0 "Formalise Cooperation"
 WAR_formalize_cooperation_desc:0 "Hippogriffia’s extensive aid has earned them a great deal of goodwill from our people, many already see them as our protectors, or even allies. Perhaps, since their economic interests align with ours, it’s time to take steps towards making this a reality."
 WAR_use_radar:0 "Peering Through the Aether"
 WAR_use_radar_desc:0 "Long-range detection completely changes the way we look at warfare. Our military minds are insistent on investing in this new technology, as it gives us a way to peer through the fog of war."
 WAR_modern_rifles:0 "The Modern Rifle"
 WAR_modern_rifles_desc:0 "Infantry are the backbone of any military, and the rifle is the main tool of infantry. Our muskets and breech-loaders simply will not cut it in modern warfare.

 WAR_tax_the_corporations:0 "Tax the Corporations"
 WAR_tax_the_corporations_desc:0 "The Great Rebuilding initiatives have been spearheaded by foreign investors and businesses, their tax breaks allowed them to build strong enterprises that expanded our industry. Now that growth has stabilised, it is time to implement a more appropriate tax policy."

 WAR_roads_and_railroads_desc:0 "Our limited infrastructure has long impeded growth in our towns and rural regions. By expanding our road network and reorganising our Department of Transport, we can increase the interconnectivity of our nation, as well as preparing for future improvements."
 WAR_open_for_business:0 "Open for Business"
 WAR_open_for_business_desc:0 "Now that our infrastructure and industrial methods have been expanded, we can finally tap into the mineral resources in the lowlands. These mines will give us many of the materials we need to maintain a modern military and economy."

 ## Royalist Political Tree

 WAR_intelligence_funds:0 "Intelligence Funds"
 WAR_intelligence_funds_desc:0 "If the last decade has made anything clear, it is that the nation's intelligence is in a very sorry state. Caught unawares over and over, it is clear that more resources must be devoted to the nation's intelligence network."
 WAR_the_storm_king_problem:0 "The Elephant in the Room"

 WAR_cowards_no_longer:0 "Cowards No Longer"
 WAR_cowards_no_longer_desc:0 "When the Storm King, we tried to fight back, but our fear was too strong, and we cowered like chickens before his approaching armada. The Warzenan people have changed much since that fateful day, and are now more than willing to face their enemy to the bitter end."

 ## Royalist Exile Tree

 WAR_send_guns:0 "Ask For Equipment"

 WAR_evacuate_government:0 "Prepare Evacuation"
 WAR_evacuate_government_desc:0 "It’s becoming apparent that this war may not be won conventionally, but that doesn’t mean we’ll stop fighting, we’ve come too far to let ourselves be conquered.

 WAR_resistance_funds:0 "Fund the Resistance"

 ### IDEAS ###
 WAR_fervent_civil_unrest:0 "Fervent Civil Unrest"
 WAR_fervent_civil_unrest_desc:0 "For the past century, Warzena has been plagued by ineffective leadership and unstable governments, resulting in general stagnation and unrest. Many activists began to clamor for change, but their calls fell on deaf ears, and they were ultimately repressed. This soon culminated in the formation of the Coalition of Anti-Monarchy Organizations (CAMO), an underground resistance movement that seeks to overthrow the monarchy and completely reshape Warzena. The fallout of the Storm King’s invasion has served to further stir up the already volatile political climate, as discontent with the ruling system has grown to levels heretofore unheard of and more people are becoming disillusioned with the current state of affairs, swelling CAMO’s ranks, and bolstering the organization’s support network."

 WAR_hippogriffian_aid:0 "Hippogriffian Aid"
 WAR_hippogriffian_aid_desc:0 "After the Storm King was defeated, Warzena was left in a dire situation, with an economy in tatters, and its capital sacked and destroyed. The hippogriffs, who had occupied Zumidia, offered to help the struggling nation. The king accepted their proposition, and for the past two years, Warzena has received advice and material aid from Hippogriffia. Although this has prevented the nation from completely collapsing, the situation still remains tenuous at best, not to mention those who are displeased with the presence of the hippogriffs and the nation’s dependence on them."

 WAR_devastated_economy:0 "Devastated Economy"
 WAR_devastated_economy_desc:0 "When Warzena broke free of Quaggatai rule, it found itself in a precarious position. The ancient trade route from Maregypt, that had once passed through Warzena to reach the great cities of Zonicia, had been rendered obsolete by the invention of new ships that could travel vast distances by sea. This left Warzena stripped of its economic lifeblood, and the economy soon began to falter. The construction of the Second Temple in the 850s pushed the already unsteady economy to its limits, kickstarting 150 years of economic downturn and stagnation. The situation continued to worsen as succeeding rulers were unable to handle the issue, further exacerbated by the loss of Tobuck in 956, which only sped up the economy’s decline. Although the start of the 11th century seemed to promise a reversal of the kingdom’s fortunes, the Storm King’s invasion shattered those hopes, and has left the economy in complete freefall. The new king is nearly at his wit’s end and underground resistance has grown to monumental levels, as people from across Warzena seek some sort of solution."

While the Warzenans have since enjoyed unprecendented prosperity and privilege within the Hippogriff Hegemony, personal freedoms are nonexistant and independence is a bad joke. Fed a steady diet of propaganda about Warzenan superiority to other zebras by Arisian media, many ironically flocked to the anti-hippogriff CAMO ultranationalists.\n\nThese contradictions were bound to explode. [WAR.GetLeader], though little more than a figurehead, had become a symbol of both harmonist intransigence and hippogriff collaboration. On a hot day in a visit to a small village, three shots rang out.\n\n[WAR.GetLeader] was only hit once, but it was days before anycreature knew he would survive his wound, and weeks before he was let out of the Arisian hospital he was treated at. When he returned, he no longer recognized Warzena.\n\nOutrage at the would-be assassin and other CAMO ultranationalists was channeled into a ruthless purge. Family members denounced each other for anti-Arisian activity. The syncretist religious movement promoted by the hippogriffs -which saw the Warzenan and hippogriff gods as one and the same- finally gained traction, as service after service was held praying for [WAR.GetLeader].\n\n[WAR.GetLeader] had been transformed into a symbol of faith and national endurance, but in the interests of his protection he was not to leave the palace again except under heavy hippogriff guard."
 warzena.20.a:0 "[WAR.GetLeader] danced on The Ace's strings, to thunderous applause."

 warzena.21.t:0 "A Greater Warzena?"
 warzena.21.d:0 "Despite Warzena's status as a subject of Aris, an uncharacteristically assertive demand has reached us. Signed by their king and leading Warzenan nationalists, it calls for the repatriation of the city of Tobuck to Warzena, "such that our nation may be made whole again and the outrages of the Imazeeb theft of Tobuck rectified."\n\nIt was classic irredentist messaging, and Crack Lightning couldn't help but feel a twinge of pride. The King probably didn't draft it, but whoever did was a zebra after his own heart. He'd have to meet them, whoever they were. Still, there were practical considerations.\n\nCeding Tobuck fully to Warzenan administration was not part of his plan at all; Tobuck was to be exploited more thoroughly, rather than given the special treatment due to Warzenans. And besides, they were mostly ponies: while ceding Tobuck would bolster Warzenan pride, it could dilute their national-racial character in the long run. It might even give them ideas. Ideas of independence.\n\nOn the other claw, the Warzenans could probably handle it cheaper and more easily. Some part of Crack did want to reward this kind of thinking from his favourite subjects. They deserved to be proud and strong."

 ### LEADER DESCRIPTIONS ###
 
 WAR_king_zarizel_ii:0 "King Barekzamal VII"
 WAR_king_zarizel_ii_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 24th of August, 984 in Zamivgazal\n\n§YBiography§!: The second son of Zamaliahon XV, Barekzamal had an idyllic childhood, free of struggle. While his brother, Zamaliahon, was subject to endless tutoring as the crown prince, Barekzamal spent his days playing with the foals of the nobility, and galloping gleefully through the streets of Zamivgazal. His favourite playmate was Ummazanit Nazlayn, the daughter of a prominent noble. Although she was intended as a future bride for his brother, they were never officially engaged, and she much preferred Barekzamal's company to that of his eccentric brother.\n\nWhen Zamaliahon was made king in 1001, he swiftly leapt into action. He formally renounced any intention of marrying in the near future, leaving Barekzamal and Ummazanit free to get married. The two soon sired their first foal, a colt named Hannizamal. However, since Barekzamal was technically his brother's successor, he did make an effort to educate himself on the basics of statecraft and governance. But there was no rush. After all, they were young, and had their whole lives ahead of them. His brother would eventually find a nice mare and Barekzamal could live the rest of his life in bliss. Unfortunately, the gods had other plans for the young prince, and in 1005, his precious world was turned upside down.\n\nAs the Storm King swept through the kingdom, Barekzamal and his family managed to escape, but his brother didn't, and was slain in the Palace by the invaders. When Barekzamal found out, he was overwhelmed by grief, weeping for hours on end. After the conqueror was slain, Barekzamal returned to Zamivgazal a changed person. He quickly set to work, trying to keep the nation afloat. Although he had some success, for the most part, his policies were ineffective as his inexperience betrayed him. Now, he sits uneasy on the throne as the threat of revolt grows. While not as unpopular as his father was, he definitely has his fair share of opposition. The fate of the nation rests on his haunches, and it will take monumental effort on his part to keep it, and his throne, from falling out of his grasp. But Barekzamal is determined to bring Warzena into a brighter future, where he can smile with his family once more."

 ### FOCUS ###
 
 ## Stabilising the Government Tree
 WAR_reeling_from_shock:0 "Reeling From The Shock"
 WAR_reeling_from_shock_desc:0 "The Storm King's invasion has left the nation shell-shocked, and many are unsure of where to go. The king is doing his best to keep the peace, but his opposition see it as their time to strike and bring change to this ancient kingdom."
 WAR_road_to_recovery:0 "The Road To Recovery..."
 WAR_road_to_recovery_desc:0 "To say Warzena's situation is bad would be a gross understatement. However, sitting around on our rumps all day complaining won't do anyone any good, and the country must stand up and begin to look towards the future once more."
 WAR_is_not_easy:0 "...Isn't An Easy One"
 WAR_is_not_easy_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, all the romantic bravado in the world isn't enough to hide the monumental challenges that face us as we attempt to rebuild the nation. But, it does work as solid motivation to keep the people going as we struggle for a brighter future."
 WAR_stop_the_bleeding:0 "Stop The Bleeding"
 WAR_stop_the_bleeding_desc:0 "Currently on its last legs and being kept barely afloat by Hippogriffian aid, the economy is in a particularly sorry state. We must take any measures necessary to stop the economy from collapsing outright, even if they're only temporary."
 WAR_the_peoples_hearts:0 "The People's Hearts"
 WAR_the_peoples_hearts_desc:0 "The Warzenan commonfolk have suffered the most from the events of the past few years, and they have been almost completely demoralized. We must temper the people's hearts, to ease the pain of what came before, and to prepare them for what is to follow."
 WAR_assess_the_damage:0 "Assess The Damage"
 WAR_assess_the_damage_desc:0 "Even though the abysmal state of the nation is clear to anyone who looks, the real question is how bad the damage truly is. We must assess the nation to truly understand the harm done and come up with the most effective course of action as quickly as possible."
 WAR_a_crucial_hour:0 "A Crucial Hour"
 WAR_a_crucial_hour_desc:0 "A crucial hour has befallen Warzena: will she stick to a status quo spanning the millennia, or will she start anew in this ever changing world?"
 WAR_faith_in_king:0 "Faith In The King"
 WAR_faith_in_king_desc:0 "It seems that tradition has managed to persevere once more, and all of Warzena now looks towards King Barekzamal to be the king he needs to be, and the leader they believe he can be."
 WAR_a_fresh_start:0 "A Fresh Start"
 WAR_a_fresh_start_desc:0 "Millennia of tradition have failed Warzena for too long, and this catastrophe was the final straw. Now, a ragtag band of visionaries is at the helm, ready to lead Warzena in a new direction, and hopefully, to a brighter future."
 WAR_a_hasty_prayer:0 "A Hasty Prayer"
 WAR_a_hasty_prayer_desc:0 "Although he has managed to keep his throne, the King has nevertheless become overburdened by stress. Hopefully, the support of the clergy and the gods will prove sufficient to aid him in these trying times."
 WAR_appease_the_rabble:0 "Appease The Rabble"
 WAR_appease_the_rabble_desc:0 "The people are uppity, and a palpable tension hangs in the air. That isn't to say that their qualms are unjustified, as much of the current situation is the result of incompetent leadership. Nevertheless, if we do not assuage them soon, CAMO may be able to regain its waning momentum."
 WAR_emergency_measures:0 "Emergency Measures"
 WAR_emergency_measures_desc:0 "Although we have managed to prevent the country from collapsing outright, the situation is still tenuous at best, and without further measures, may spiral completely out of our control. Even if they are temporary, these policies will ensure that the country can keep its bearings until a more permanent solution is implemented."
 WAR_traitors_among_us:0 "The Traitors Among Us..."
 WAR_traitors_among_us_desc:0 "Although we would like to believe that the royal court can be trusted, we must accept the harsh reality that there are traitors and backstabbers among us, with even the king's closest advisors being potential impostors relaying information to our enemies."
 WAR_all_around_us:0 "...And All Around Us"
 WAR_all_around_us_desc:0 "All across the country, there is a vast network of those opposed to the monarchy, consisting of a myriad of different people, coming from different walks of life. They blend in with the crowds, and are nearly undetectable. But, they are not invincible. If the main agents of dissidence can be tracked down and neutralized, then the beast they built will surely follow."
 WAR_proper_coronation:0 "A Proper Coronation"
 WAR_proper_coronation_desc:0 "After 3 years of devastation and misery, Warzena is finally able to witness the coronation of her king. While he may not have been intended for the throne, it is now his, and it is now up to him to use its powers to guide the country towards a better and brighter future."
 
 ## Great Rebuilding Tree
 WAR_great_rebuilding:0 "The Great Rebuilding"
 WAR_great_rebuilding_desc:0 "Now that our government has stabilised, we must turn our efforts to our devastated and outdated economy. The Great Rebuilding will be Warzena's rise from the ashes. The road will be long and hard, but the grandest temples are built one stone at a time."
 WAR_worship_hippogriff_hooves:0 "Work With The Hippogriffs"
 WAR_worship_hippogriff_hooves_desc:0 "Intervention from Hippogriffia has been instrumental in keeping our realm intact. Further Hippogriff involvement would greatly hasten our modernisation efforts. Though, their influence in our country would increase considerably."
 WAR_own_industry:0 "Standing On Our Own"
 WAR_own_industry_desc:0 "We are forever grateful to our friends in Hippogriffia, but if we want to reach our true potential, then our people must stand on their own four hooves. We need more domestic production, to give them work and income. Only that way can Warzena recover."
 WAR_increase_mining:0 "Open Up Mining"
 WAR_increase_mining_desc:0 "There is a wealth of untapped minerals laying right beneath our hooves. Utilising Hippogriff expertise and logistics, we could expand our mining operations throughout the lowlands, nearly doubling our current output."
 WAR_synthetic_stuff:0 "Synthetic Resources"
 WAR_synthetic_stuff_desc:0 "Fuel is the lifeblood of a modern economy, and essential to a modern military. We lack natural oil, but there are Hippogriff refining companies that could produce enough fuel to keep things running. Perhaps we should offer them a contract?"
 WAR_address_illiteracy:0 "Address Illiteracy"
 WAR_address_illiteracy_desc:0 "Education reform has long been on our agenda. By establishing adult learning centres and expanding the reach of our public schools, we can begin to improve our citizens' literacy and numeracy."
 WAR_address_poverty:0 "Address Poverty"
 WAR_address_poverty_desc:0 "A sizeable amount of our unskilled workers are unemployed. We could prioritise creating entry-level jobs in Rebuilding projects to keep these workers above the poverty line, as well as promoting national unity."
 WAR_sever_economic_ties:0 "Sever Economic Ties"
 WAR_sever_economic_ties_desc:0 "The time has come to end the foreign aid programmes. They brought a great deal of good, but they were never long-term solutions. It will take more work, but by developing our domestic industrial sector, we can mitigate foreign influence in our economy."
 WAR_knicknacks_and_medicine:0 "Shoes, Medicine, And Candy"
 WAR_knicknacks_and_medicine_desc:0 "We have enormous stockpiles of everyday goods, like shoes, work clothing, medicine, and sugar, in Zamivgazal. Perhaps if we distributed these throughout our more poverty-stricken regions, the people would see that we have their best interests at heart."
 WAR_auction_our_souls:0 "Resource Rights For Technology"
 WAR_auction_our_souls_desc:0 "Hippogriffia is willing to provide us with technical knowledge and training in a various scientific fields. In exchange, they want temporary resource extraction charters. This could be an opportunity for us to narrow the scientific gap between our nations."
 WAR_invest_in_radio:0 "Invest In Radio"
 WAR_invest_in_radio_desc:0 "Investing in FM Radio would not only be a boon to our military's cohesion, but would also allow us to easily broadcast information to our rural citizens."
 WAR_industrialize:0 "The Industrialisation Issue"
 WAR_industrialize_desc:0 "Even before the Storm King's wars, our nation was woefully lacking in machinery, instead reliant on cottage industries and outdated factories. Under our new plan, we can restructure our industry to properly utilise machine tools and modern production line methods."
 WAR_new_gun_factories:0 "New Gun Factories"
 WAR_new_gun_factories_desc:0 "Our arms industry cannot be left out of our economic restructuring. Investing into additional factories is essential to increasing our military's capability to wage war."
 WAR_rapid_buildup:0 "Rapid Buildup"
 WAR_rapid_buildup_desc:0 "Rebuilding our nation will take an unprecedented amount of work. By implementing a five-year austerity plan, we can concentrate our efforts towards construction with clear production goals in mind."
 WAR_formalize_cooperation:0 "Formalise Cooperation"
 WAR_formalize_cooperation_desc:0 "Hippogriffia's extensive aid has earned them a great deal of goodwill from our people, many already see them as our protectors, or even allies. Perhaps, since their economic interests align with ours, it's time to take steps towards making this a reality."
 WAR_use_radar:0 "Peering Through The Aether"
 WAR_use_radar_desc:0 "Long-range detection completely changes the way we look at warfare. Our military minds are insistent on investing in this new technology, as it gives us a way to peer through the fog of war."
 WAR_modern_rifles:0 "The Modern Rifle"
 WAR_modern_rifles_desc:0 "Infantry are the backbone of any military, and the rifle is the main tool of infantry. Our muskets and breech-loaders simply will not cut it in modern warfare. Thankfully, our procurement officers have found gunsmiths capable of producing reliable bolt-action rifles. We should offer them contracts."
 WAR_tax_the_corporations:0 "Tax The Corporations"
 WAR_tax_the_corporations_desc:0 "The Great Rebuilding initiatives have been spearheaded by foreign investors and businesses, their tax breaks allowed them to build strong enterprises that expanded our industry. Now that growth has stabilised, it is time to implement a more appropriate tax policy."
 WAR_roads_and_railroads:0 "Roads And Railroads"
 WAR_roads_and_railroads_desc:0 "Our limited infrastructure has long impeded growth in our towns and rural regions. By expanding our road network and reorganising our Department of Transport, we can increase the interconnectivity of our nation, as well as preparing for future improvements."
 WAR_open_for_business:0 "Open For Business"
 WAR_open_for_business_desc:0 "Now that our infrastructure and industrial methods have been expanded, we can finally tap into the mineral resources in the lowlands. These mines will give us many of the materials we need to maintain a modern military and economy."
 WAR_rebuilding_complete:0 "The Rebuilding Complete"
 WAR_rebuilding_complete_desc:0 "It has been a long and arduous path, but thanks to our efforts, we have taken the rubble that the Storm King left behind and built it into a nation. Now we stand proud, for our children will grow up in a new, modern realm."
 
 ## Royalist Political Tree
 WAR_dealing_with_CAMO:0 "Cleaning The Mess"
 WAR_dealing_with_CAMO_desc:0 "Although the main body of resistance has been dealt with, the agents of discord remain active. Many elements that were kept in check by CAMO leadership have grown bolder and even more radical, which has not aided the situation."
 WAR_find_the_socialists:0 "Purge The Radicals"
 WAR_find_the_socialists_desc:0 "It is imperative that we neutralize the more radical anti-monarchy elements, before they have the chance to cause too much trouble."
 WAR_paramilitary_guerrillas:0 "Paramilitary Guerrillas"
 WAR_paramilitary_guerrillas_desc:0 "Warzena has no shortage of radical elements that are itching to fight the invaders. All they need is some equipment. But caution is necessary, lest they end up taking all the credit."
 WAR_find_the_nonaligned:0 "Flush Out The Remnants"
 WAR_find_the_nonaligned_desc:0 "The remaining leaders of CAMO have gone into hiding, but they cannot escape us forever. They must be hunted down and pacified, to prevent them from reclaiming their lost momentum."
 WAR_find_the_fascists:0 "The Final Sweep"
 WAR_find_the_fascists_desc:0 "The traitors are on their last legs, and one final push should be all we need to quell any remaining elements of discontent."
 WAR_strike_a_deal:0 "Strike Up A Deal"
 WAR_strike_a_deal_desc:0 "In order to defend our nation, it may be necessary to reach out to the more tame anti-monarchist elements, in order to organize a united front against the invaders."
 WAR_salvage_the_economy:0 "Picking Up The Pieces"
 WAR_salvage_the_economy_desc:0 "The economy has suffered blow after blow in the past few years, and is hanging on by a thread. It is high time that we properly addressed it."
 WAR_intelligence_funds:0 "Intelligence Funds"
 WAR_intelligence_funds_desc:0 "If the last decade has made anything clear, it is that the nation's intelligence is in a very sorry state. Caught unawares over and over, it is clear that more resources must be devoted to the nation's intelligence network."
 WAR_the_storm_king_problem:0 "The Elephant In The Room"
 WAR_the_storm_king_problem_desc:0 "Despite our attempts to tiptoe around it, it is blatantly clear that we must face our fears and address the phantom menace that has hung over Warzena since 1005."
 WAR_peace_at_home:0 "Peace at Home..."
 WAR_peace_at_home_desc:0 "In these trying times, we must ensure the nation remains unified and stable, lest we give our enemies an easy opening with which to tear us apart."
 WAR_never_again:0 "Never Again"
 WAR_never_again_desc:0 "The horrors of 1005 have permanently etched themselves into the hearts of every Warzenan, but we are determined to never allow another Storm King to harm us again."
 WAR_ear_on_every_street:0 "An Ear On Every Street"
 WAR_ear_on_every_street_desc:0 "We must expand our intelligence network in order to better protect against any potential threats, from both within and without."
 WAR_more_storm_king:0 "Revive Our Industry"
 WAR_more_storm_king_desc:0 "At the start of the century, Warzena had a small, but growing, industrial sector. That all changed when the Storm King attacked. Now, with the situation back under control, it is time we begin to restore our industry, so it may reach its fullest potential."
 WAR_cowards_no_longer:0 "Cowards No Longer"
 WAR_cowards_no_longer_desc:0 "When the Storm King attacked, we tried to fight back, but our fear was too strong, and we cowered like chickens before his approaching armada. The Warzenan people have changed much since that fateful day, and are now more than willing to face their enemy to the bitter end."
 WAR_full_steam_ahead:0 "Full Steam Ahead"
 WAR_full_steam_ahead_desc:0 "With our industry going into full swing, aspiring entrepreneurs are more willing than ever to launch new ventures and experiment with new services and commodities."
 WAR_guns_and_more_guns:0 "The Question Of The Stolen Artefacts"

 WAR_begin_the_search_desc:0 "We must go forth in search of our treasures, so that we can reclaim what was lost and restore our nation's pride."
 WAR_never_forgive:0 "Never Forgive, Never Forget"
 WAR_never_forgive_desc:0 "Although it will hurt, we must accept the loss of our treasures, and learn to cherish what we have. The people may not like it, but it is the reality we find ourselves in, and we must adapt accordingly."
 WAR_under_an_open_sky:0 "Under An Open Sky"
 WAR_under_an_open_sky_desc:0 "After years of torment and hard work, we have managed to persevere and crawl back to a state of normalcy. We head towards a brighter future with heads held high. The clouds have cleared and the sun shines warmly overhead."
 WAR_diplomatic_corps:0 "Expand the Diplomatic Corps"
 WAR_diplomatic_corps_desc:0 "As we venture forth onto the international stage, we must ensure that our interests are represented in the best way possible. In order to guarantee this, we must expand our corps of diplomats and ambassadors."
 WAR_foreign_diplomacy:0 "Analyzing the Situation"
 WAR_foreign_diplomacy_desc:0 "Warzena has spent too much of her history isolating herself from the world, which has not always worked out in our favor. This time, Warzena must go out into the world and gauge her surroundings, so that she may assert her position in the neverending drama of international relations."
 WAR_joint_training_exercises:0 "Threats On All Sides"
 WAR_joint_training_exercises_desc:0 "As we examine the current political climate, it has become abundantly clear that the region has grown more hostile to our interests. Warzena must adapt and prepare to weather the coming storm, lest we are all washed away in the tides of history."
 WAR_peace_abroad:0 "...And Peace Abroad"
 WAR_peace_abroad_desc:0 "In order to ensure our survival, we must reach out towards foreign governments with similar ideals and make every effort to secure friendly relations, so that no harm shall come from beyond our nation's borders."
 WAR_traitors_and_lunatics:0 "Traitors And Lunatics"
 WAR_traitors_and_lunatics_desc:0 "There is no doubt that the greatest threat Warzena currently faces is the one posed by the brooding denizens of Chiropterra. Launching raids into our frontier since time immemorial, they have since grown bolder and more frenzied, yet simultaneously even more secretive. We must prepare to defend our nation in case the bats decide to do something beyond a simple raid."
 WAR_southern_bulwark:0 "The Southern Bulwark"
 WAR_southern_bulwark_desc:0 "Although the Zumidian mandate covers our northern flank, the south lies concerningly exposed. With threats mounting from the Chiropterran mountains, it has become imperative that we shore up our defenses to thwart any invasions that seek to end our sovereignty."
 WAR_refit_defenses:0 "Refit Our Defenses"
 WAR_refit_defenses_desc:0 "Prior Warzenan kings had built several rudimentary defensive structures across the country, but they have since fallen into disarray, and the few that are still functional would be woefully incapable of impeding an enemy advance. It is crucial that we upgrade our old defenses, so that they can face the fury of modern warfare."
 WAR_reach_out_to_zarantia:0 "Reach Out To The Zarantians"
 WAR_reach_out_to_zarantia_desc:0 "Warzena's current standing with Zarantia can be described as tenuous at best, as the Warzenans and Imazeebs have butted heads several times during the past century. However, the existential threat posed by Chiropterra has deemed it necessary to cast aside our old animosities in favor of cooperation, so that both nations can be free."
 WAR_tobuck_resistance:0 "The Tobuckian Resistance"
 WAR_tobuck_resistance_desc:0 "Although Tobuck was never particularly fond of our rule, they despise their current occupiers even more. In order to hamper our enemies' operations, we must aid the local resistance movements in any we can in order to cause as much disruption to the enemy as possible."
 WAR_fortify_menuch:0 "Fortify The Menuch"
 WAR_fortify_menuch_desc:0 "The Menuch, lifeblood of Warzena, is one of the nation's most strategically vital resources. If it were to fall under enemy control, the nation would be left extremely vulnerable. Bolstering its defenses is therefore critical in our efforts to prepare the nation for the eventuality of war."
 WAR_zumidian_contacts:0 "Zumidian Contacts"
 WAR_zumidian_contacts_desc:0 "As fellow Zonicians, Warzena has always had amiable relations with the Zumidians to the north. Now, united against a common enemy, our ties have grown even closer. Using our connections, we should be able to secure the help of several Zumidian groups in order to supplement our armed forces."
 WAR_border_fortifications:0 "Our Friends To The North"
 WAR_border_fortifications_desc:0 "Even if we do not have a long history of cooperation, Hippogriffia has nevertheless become one of Warzena's principal allies, thanks in no small part to the aid offered following the Storm King's defeat. It would be wise to maintain these newly forged bonds, as they may prove useful sooner rather than later."
 WAR_tank_project:0 "Deepen Our Bonds"
 WAR_tank_project_desc:0 "With the situation having stabilized and the country returned to relative peace, it is an opportune moment to expand our relationship with the hippogriffs beyond that of simple philanthropy. Closer diplomatic ties would mean expanded access to advanced Hippogriffian technology and military tactics. However, we must be careful, lest Aris lose interest once it feels that its business here is done."
 WAR_propose_an_alliance:0 "Propose An Alliance"
 WAR_propose_an_alliance_desc:0 "As the situation grows ever drearier in North Zebrica, it has become obvious that simple friendly relations will not be enough to protect Warzena from the threats looming on its frontier. A formalized military alliance will be crucial for Warzena's survival in the tumultuous years to come."
 WAR_joint_training_exercises_real:0 "Joint Training Exercises"
 WAR_joint_training_exercises_real_desc:0 "The Hippogriffian armed forces, although not the most elite fighting force in the world, are still leagues beyond anything Warzena's military can offer. A series of joint military exercises will prove invaluable towards improving the capability of our armed forces while also providing the hippogriffs an opportunity to keep their own military sharp."
 WAR_roads_from_seas:0 "Roads From The Sea"
 WAR_roads_from_seas_desc:0 "Along with much of its consumer goods, Warzena imports nearly a quarter of its military equipment from Hippogriffia. Ensuring the safe transport of these goods is of the utmost importance. Fortunately, we can accommodate for any disruptions by refitting our ports to integrate them with the existing Seaquestrian logistic infrastructure network and expanding the capacity of our coastal railroads."
 WAR_matter_of_tobuck:0 "The Spoils Of War"
 WAR_matter_of_tobuck_desc:0 "The defeat of Chiropterra and her allies, although cause for much celebration, has also opened several questions, namely concerning the occupied territories. We should move to resolve these as quickly as possible, so that any new tensions don't have time to grow and rear their ugly heads."
 
 ## Royalist Exile Tree
 WAR_dear_friends:0 "Dear Friends"
 WAR_dear_friends_desc:0 "There can be no doubt, another storm is brewing in North Zebrica. Our neighbours have made their intentions perfectly clear, and soon we shall have to face them. Just as with the Storm King, we cannot do it alone."
 WAR_fears_are_realized:0 "Our Fears Are Realised"
 WAR_fears_are_realized_desc:0 "Our trial has begun. Once again, our sovereignty, our right to exist is being threatened. We must fight with every ounce of strength we have. For our homes, for our children, for our King!"
 WAR_send_troops:0 "Ask For Recruits"
 WAR_send_troops_desc:0 "We are fighting outnumbered. Without reinforcements, our units cannot maintain their required personnel. We should ask our allies for recruits to bolster our ranks."
 WAR_send_guns:0 "Ask For Equipment"
 WAR_send_guns_desc:0 "We are fighting outgunned. Without materiel, our units cannot perform their functions, and our fighting capability crumbles. We should ask our allies for equipment to keep our military operational."
 WAR_evacuate_government:0 "Prepare Evacuation"
 WAR_evacuate_government_desc:0 "It's becoming apparent that this war may not be won conventionally, but that doesn't mean we'll stop fighting, we've come too far to let ourselves be conquered. We must prepare the government for evacuation. We'll continue the war from abroad if we must, by Zal and Zanit, we shall never stop fighting."
 WAR_resistance_funds:0 "Fund The Resistance"
 WAR_resistance_funds_desc:0 "With so many of our citizens under foreign yoke, we need to reorganise our budget and provide support for resistance cells. An effective Warzenan underground state can organise insurgencies and support the war effort."
 WAR_exiled_factories:0 "Exiled Factories"
 WAR_exiled_factories_desc:0 "Our troops will need equipment to keep up the fight, and we can't be completely reliant on our allies' generosity. We should use the materials we brought over to set up own factories, that way we can make and maintain our own kit."
 WAR_exiled_soldiers:0 "Exiled Soldiers"
 WAR_exiled_soldiers_desc:0 "Every day, more and more of our valiant soldiers are escaping the occupation to join the government in exile. Their hearts yearn for their homeland and burn with desire for vengeance. We must organise these fellows into our new military, so they can take back what's rightfully theirs."
 WAR_exiled_generals:0 "Exiled Officers"
 WAR_exiled_generals_desc:0 "Now that our military needs have changed, we have many exiled officers with little to do. Our allied general staff could make good use of them in their administration, which would also display the continued cooperation between our governments."
 WAR_international_volunteers_focus:0 "International Volunteers"
 WAR_international_volunteers_focus_desc:0 "Our plight is making headlines all around the world, an ancient kingdom about to be extinguished is agitating enough to sell papers. Letters have been arriving in droves from foreigners who wish to join our struggle. We should establish and promote international brigades before something else takes over the news cycle."
 WAR_warzena_is_not_yet_lost:0 "Warzena Is Not Yet Lost"
 WAR_warzena_is_not_yet_lost_desc:0 "Once again, we have been struck low by a foreign scourge, once again, our people suffer under a rotten regime. But we will not stop fighting. Our muzzle is bloodied, but we're returning with a vengeance like no other. We shall liberate ourselves, Warzena is not yet lost."
 
 ## Military Tree
 WAR_warzenan_military:0 "The Warzenan Military"
 WAR_warzenan_military_desc:0 "Thanks in large part to our isolationist past, our military has not seen much improvement since the days of the Quaggatai. As a result, it lags woefully behind the forces of our neighbors. If we are to have a fighting chance in the upcoming struggle, we must invest in our military before it is too late."
 WAR_backbone_of_army:0 "The Backbone of the Army"
 WAR_backbone_of_army_desc:0 "The army, the largest component of the military and the primary defender of the nation, is currently hindered by a crippling crutch. The majority of the weapons our troops have access to are outdated and barely functioning, at best. Arms are the foundation on which a good army is built, and ours must be up to par if we want our army to have any semblance of efficacy."
 WAR_backbone_of_navy:0 "The Backbone of the Navy"

 warzena.1.d:0 "A powerful hurricane glanced off the edge of our coastline. Inland flooding led to many deaths, and our roads lie buried in mud."
 warzena.1.a:0 "That's horrible."
 warzena.2.t:0 "A Nation Paralyzed"
 warzena.2.d:0 "The last 200 years have not been kind to Warzena.\n\nAlthough its liberation from the Quaggatai seemed to promise a return to its ancient status quo of isolation and prosperity, fate had other plans for the little kingdom. With the disappearance of the trade route that had run through it, the economy was left crippled and any attempts at reforms were only mildly successful, at best. Meanwhile, the Imazeeb, infuriated by taxes imposed on goods passing through Warzenan ports, took the opportunity to seize the port of Tobuck for themselves, dealing another hefty blow to the economy. During the latter half of the 10th century, the nation languished under a string of negligent and incompetent kings, whose advisors only sought to enrich themselves. This caused anti-monarchist sentiment to fester, as calls for reform were ignored, and its proponents penalized, culminating in the formation of the Coalition of Anti-Monarchy Organizations, or CAMO for short, in the late 970s.\n\nWhen Zamaliahon XVI came to the throne, it seemed that things were finally looking up for Warzena. Under his leadership, the economy's decline began to slow, while new industries began to take root. Many began to wonder if Warzena would finally be able to get back on its legs. Unfortunately, they wouldn't get to find out as, in 1005, the Storm King attacked. His vast armada obliterated the kingdom's meager defenses, and soon, he had seized control of the country. The Second Temple was stripped of its valuables and the structure destroyed afterwards. The king was killed during a raid on the Royal Palace, seemingly snuffing out the country's last hope.\n\nThe conqueror would be slain only a few months later at the fateful battle of Ain Trotgourait, liberating the countless peoples that he had subjugated. But the country was now in ruins. Barekzamal VII, the late king's brother, was never meant to rule, and his inexperience has made the nation's problems all the more glaring. The economy is clinging on to life with Hippogriffian aid, but no one knows how long it can last like this. Zamivgazal lies in ruins, along with many parts of the countryside, and national morale is at an all-time low. All the while, CAMO has grown more popular than ever, as countless commoners flock to their cause, which promises a solution to the country's woes. Either way, it would take a miracle to heal this broken nation, and many are unsure if it can be done."
 warzena.2.a:0 "May Zal and Zanit protect us in these trying times."
 warzena.3.t:0 "The Road Ahead"
 warzena.3.d:0 "The country is currently plagued by countless maladies, ranging from widespread economic downturn to local food shortages. The nation's cities are littered with rubble and crowded with the destitute, while the countryside is marred by busted roads and fields left fallow.\n\nIn order to alleviate this, the King's advisors have proposed a series of measures that would promote general recovery, with an emphasis on restoring the nation's urban centers and encouraging industrial development. Some in the court raised concerns about the proposal being too focused on the cities, and too neglectful of rural areas. After some heated debate, it was eventually passed to the King, who just barely managed to convince the dissenters that revitalizing the industrial sector was critical for long-term recovery, but made sure to incorporate extra provisions for rural recovery nonetheless.\n\nSimultaneously, CAMO's leaders have come up with a plan of their own to help reverse the nation's plight. Their efforts are on a smaller scale than anything the King could do, but their dedication is all that matters. Their main focus is the revitalization of their supporter base in the countryside, where CAMO members have been sent to assist in the reparation of local infrastructure and promote the replanting of fields so that food can make its way towards their urban allies. Although the plan is somewhat crude, with some more ambitious elements having been cut due to compromise, the organization's leaders are able to agree on it, and it will hopefully serve them well in garnering support for their cause.\n\nWith both plans being put into effect, ultimately, only one can truly capture the attention of the nation. It soon becomes clear that the more influential of the two was..."
 warzena.3.a:0 "...the Royal Court's recovery measures."
 warzena.3.b:0 "...CAMO's grassroots efforts."
 warzena.4.t:0 "The Challenges That Await Us"
 warzena.4.d:0 "Reversing the nation's fortunes is going to be by no means easy. It will be an uphill battle from start to finish, something both the King and CAMO are quite aware of.\n\nTo smooth over the process of recovery, the Royal Court has suggested passing further economic reforms in order to rejuvenate the economy. More specifically, their proposal calls for investments into entrepreneurial ventures in order to stimulate the economy with new jobs and increased production. The King also managed to introduce a stipulation for providing money to those that were hit hardest, such as laborers and artisans, so that they can contribute to the economy, but also to quell the growing tide of unrest by placating the people.\n\nCAMO's efforts are much more focused, involving a series of rallies in order to improve morale, as well as gatherings where commoners can mingle and forge strong bonds of community in order to overcome the lingering trauma from 1005. Meanwhile, CAMO's wealthier members will use their connections to sympathetic elites, as well as their own coffers, to provide for those suffering the most so that they can hopefully make their way out of poverty and achieve a comfortable standard of living.\n\nThe times ahead are challenging, but hard work is always rewarded, and in the end..."
 warzena.4.a:0 "...the royal stimulus is successful."
 warzena.4.b:0 "...CAMO's cooperation pulls through."
 warzena.5.t:0 "Bandaging The Wounds"
 warzena.5.d:0 "As is well known to every Warzenan, the economy is in a dire state, with thousands left without work or access to basic necessities. Hippogriffian aid is providing a vital lifeline, but it isn't universally well-received, despite the empirical benefits.\n\nThe Royal Court, and the King in particular, hope to reach out to the hippogriffs in order to secure more aid. Although it carries the risk of rejection, the King is confident that they can win over the hippogriffs and secure more much-needed construction materials and advisors.\n\nCAMO hopes to lessen the nation's reliance on the hippogriffs, believing it to be an unnecessary crutch. The head of the Warzenan Republican League, Itthozamal Ankeper, although not an anti-hippogriff himself, does believe that reducing the nation's reliance on them as early as possible is crucial towards a proper economic recovery and securing the future health of the economy. To that end, he has proposed a series of investment and reconstruction efforts in order to ease local economies and restore certain parts of the country to pre-Storm King productivity, which will be achieved by means of the WRL's, and his personal, connections to more liberal entrepreneurs in the country.\n\nAfter just a few weeks, the economy has shown signs of recovery, thanks in large part to..."

The people have been demoralized, and the whole nation is reeling from the trauma.\n\nThe king is not the most popular figure, and many blame him for the country's problems. Even so, he isn't as universally despised as his father or grandfather, and he has enough tact and charm to please most people he meets. Although the Royal Court is somewhat hesitant about it, the king believes that the best way to restore faith in the crown is to mingle with the public and make himself more presentable.\n\nBennoam Shimzel, leader of the ultranationalist Hazrumenian Social Nationalist Party, is well regarded for his oratory skills, despite his more radical tendencies, while his literary background offers a pleasant eloquence to his diction that is unmatched by any of his peers. As such, he intends to host a series of rallies in order to drive support for CAMO's cause, and potentially his own party as well. CAMO's success hinges on popular support, and if they don't secure it as quickly as possible, Warzena may be forced to languish under the yoke of monarchist oppression for another two millennia.\n\nWhoever controls the people's hearts ultimately controls the nation, and by the end..."

 warzena.7.t:0 "The Lay Of The Land"
 warzena.7.d:0 "Following an emergency survey, the damage done to the nation has become clear. The nation's cities have been damaged extensively, with large swathes of buildings reduced to rubble, forcing hundreds onto the streets. The nascent industrial sector has been strangled in its crib, while several local institutions have collapsed. Things aren't any better in the countryside, where acres of farmland were either razed or left to fallow, while thousands of farmers were forced to relocate to the cities, overloading the already overburdened relief infrastructure.\n\nThe King hopes to improve the situation by subsidizing farmers and encouraging migration into the country in order to repopulate it so that agricultural production can be increased. The hope is that, by providing housing and food security, he can stabilize the realm and ease dissent.\n\nCAMO's plans are equally as ambitious, with proposals to fund new industrial operations being spearheaded by Zaniiaton, the young leader of the Warzenan Communist Party. By providing additional work for the nation's proletariat, she hopes to improve their quality of life, while also using it as a testing ground for her ideology.\n\nBoth efforts are ambitious, and each side is hedging their bets, but eventually..."

 warzena.8.t:0 "A Crucial Hour"
 warzena.8.d:0 "Ever since 1005, a palpable tension has hung over the nation, so thick you could cut it with a knife. It has simmered over the years, as CAMO worked in secret, preparing to overthrow the king for the good of all Warzenans. Meanwhile, the king himself, who was in way over his head, struggled to keep the peace and institute the reforms the nation so desperately needed. Now, the tension has reached a boiling point, as CAMO readies for the final strike. The king is prepared to do anything necessary to keep his throne and stop the country from falling into chaos.\n\nThe entire nation waits with baited breath, and the fate of the country now rests on a knife's edge."

 warzena.10.t:0 "A Hasty Prayer"
 warzena.10.d:0 "Every passing moment drew all of Warzena closer to the nation's future, from its every span of ancient homeland to every denizen to its lone king pacing to and fro in his chamber. The stars and moon had already begun to illuminate the night and all but the busiest of Warzena had retired to sleep, yet still the zebra remained awake.\n\nKing Barekzamal heaved a sigh and gazed over the luminant rooftops of Zamivgazal from his window. Everyzebra had done so much to restore Warzena, and still so much more remained. Though soon, perhaps admittedly even a bit too soon, the nation would be led unto its future with him officially taking the reins. Was this what his late brother felt when he had ascended the throne? All the kings and queens before?\n\nKing Barekzamal smiled. To say all of this was daunting was the understatement of history.\n\nFinally, there was a knock on the door, and Barekzamal called for the invited guests. Quietly, the zebra wondered if he should've adorned something more regal than a modestly fashioned nightgown, but worries soon vanished upon the sight of the small contingent of priests entering and bowing with the barest of ornate robes.\n\n"Good evening, your highness," the head priest spoke, "forgive our lack of proper apparel, we were informed your request was urgent."\n\nThe king returned the courtesy in kind. "Of course, so as long as you all forgive mine."\n\nHe tactfully waited a few moments for their smiles to sink in before bowing his head. "I have summoned all of you here because Warzena will soon embark upon its future, and what lies ahead will undoubtedly determine the destiny of our kingdom. This has troubled me throughout, and I wish, well, to pray, for our future and Warzena's."\n\nOne of the priests spoke nonchalantly. "Hmm, we're already up, so we might as well."\n\nBarekzamal gave a laugh of approval before any of the more stringent priests admonished the remark, moving to begin the impromptu prayer session." #Ardent Custodian

Their return today was met with much anticipation as the court and country eagerly awaited the results.\n\nTo the bewilderment and shock of the entire court, the emissary announced that the Hippogriffs had requested that Warzena become an aligned state within their sphere. Despite the euphemistic language, it was clear to everyone that Aris had demanded Warzena become a subjugated vassal state. Now, it seemed, no matter what Warzena chose, it would be stripped of its sovereignty for good. An oppressive silence overcame the room as the unsettling realization kicked in and everyone began to weigh the options: submit to Aris for protection or attempt to survive the coming storm alone."
 warzena.14.a:0 "If it'll keep us safe..."
 warzena.14.b:0 "We want protection, not subjugation!"

 warzena.15.t:0 "Warzena Requests To Tax Our Corporations"
 warzena.15.d:0 "In recent years, close cooperation between our countries has allowed Hippogriffian companies to establish themselves in Warzena. Encouraged by tax breaks and subsidies, they eagerly moved into the kingdom, which allowed its ailing economy to recover. Following the integration of Warzena into our sphere, the companies have only grown more, but now it seems that there is a bit of friction. Warzena has recently lodged a formal request to impose taxes on the Hippogriffian corporations operating in their country.\n\nThey claim that, with the recovery of their economy, they no longer need to encourage growth via subsidies and must implement sensible tax policies. The corporations have protested in turn, saying that this would harm business and labelling it a betrayal. It is quite impudent of a satellite state to make such demands, and it would be negligent to indulge them. However, Warzena needs to strengthen its economy, and allowing it to properly tax the corporations would allow it to do so. After all, is strengthening our allies not one of our most important priorities?"
 warzena.15.a:0 "It's only fair."
 warzena.15.b:0 "Subjects do not make demands."

 warzena.16.t:0 "Warzena Requests Emergency Military Training"
 warzena.16.d:0 "Warzena has recently, and suddenly, requested that our military and theirs engage in military training exercises. Despite the spontaneity of the request, it may be prudent to accept, as our own forces could use the practice, and this would be an excellent opportunity to keep them sharp. Of course, the sudden nature of the request does make it more difficult to organize, and it may be too much of a hassle to go through with it."
 warzena.16.a:0 "Our armies could use the practice."
 warzena.16.b:0 "We'd rather not."

 warzena.17.t:0 "Warzena Requests Volunteers"
 warzena.17.d:0 "We have received an urgent transmission from Warzena, imploring our government to send them reinforcements so that they can bolster their units and carry on the fight. Judging by the tone of the request, it may be wise to loan some of our forces. However, we also have to think about our own reserves, and whether or not we can realistically afford to spare some for Warzena's efforts."
 warzena.17.a:0 "Anything for our allies."
 warzena.17.b:0 "We have to consider our reserves first."

 warzena.18.t:0 "Warzena Requests Equipment"
 warzena.18.d:0 "We have received an urgent transmission from Warzena, pleading our government for material support to reinforce their units, which have been crippled by shortages of just about everything. The request conveys their desperation clearly, and we should consider sending some materiel their way. Then again, guns don't grow on trees, and a surplus one day can easily turn into a deficit the next, which means taking from the stockpile can easily come back to bite us sooner rather than later."
 warzena.18.a:0 "Send them whatever we can."
 warzena.18.b:0 "We can not jeopardize our own arms supply."

 warzena.19.t:0 "The King of Warzena Arrives"
 warzena.19.d:0 "Following Warzena's capitulation, the King and many court officials fled the nation, and were given refuge in Mount Aris. After arriving in the city, they immediately set to work, cooperating closely with our government and coordinating with their remaining forces, many of which have also found their way here. They have received a warm welcome from our people, and the King proceeded to give a speech, declaring his intention to carry on the fight until Warzena is free once more, which was received well by Warzenans and Hippogriffians alike."
 warzena.19.a:0 "Welcome, exiles."

 warzena.20.t:0 "An Absolute Outrage"
 warzena.20.d:0 "Tension had been building in Warzena ever since the king's controversial decision to submit to Aris. While the Warzenans have since enjoyed unprecedented prosperity and privilege within the Hippogriff Hegemony, personal freedoms are nonexistant and independence is a bad joke. Fed a steady diet of propaganda about Warzenan superiority to other zebras by Arisian media, many ironically flocked to the anti-hippogriff CAMO ultranationalists.\n\nThese contradictions were bound to explode. [WAR.GetLeader], though little more than a figurehead, had become a symbol of both harmonist intransigence and hippogriff collaboration. On a hot day in a visit to a small village, three shots rang out.\n\nThe King was only hit once, but it was days before anycreature knew he would survive his wound, and weeks before he was let out of the Arisian hospital he was treated at. When he returned, he no longer recognized Warzena.\n\nOutrage at the would-be assassin and other CAMO ultranationalists was channeled into a ruthless purge. Family members denounced each other for anti-Arisian activity. The syncretist religious movement promoted by the hippogriffs -which saw the Warzenan and hippogriff gods as one and the same- finally gained traction, as service after service was held praying for the King.\n\n[WAR.GetLeader] had been transformed into a symbol of faith and national endurance, but in the interests of his protection he was not to leave the palace again except under heavy hippogriff guard."

 warzena.21.t:0 "A Greater Warzena?"
 warzena.21.d:0 "Despite Warzena's status as a subject of Aris, an uncharacteristically assertive demand has reached us. Signed by their king and leading Warzenan nationalists, it calls for the repatriation of the city of Tobuck to Warzena, "such that our nation may be made whole again and the outrages of the Imazeeb theft of Tobuck rectified."\n\nIt was classic irredentist messaging, and Crack Lightning couldn't help but feel a twinge of pride. The King probably didn't draft it, but whoever did was a zebra after his own heart. He'd have to meet them, whoever they were. Still, there were practical considerations.\n\nCeding Tobuck fully to Warzenan administration was not part of his plan at all; Tobuck was to be exploited more thoroughly, rather than given the special treatment due to Warzenans. And besides, they were mostly ponies: while ceding Tobuck would bolster Warzenan pride, it could dilute their national-racial character in the long run. It might even give them ideas. Ideas of independence.\n\nOn the other claw, the Warzenans could probably handle it cheaper and more easily. Some part of Crack did want to reward this kind of thinking from his favourite subjects. They deserved to be proud and strong."
 warzena.21.a:0 "Warzena shall regain its lost lands."
 warzena.21.b:0 "Warzena is a subject, and subjects do not make demands."

 warzena.22.t:0 "Emergency Measures"
 warzena.22.d:0 ""By Warzena's highest, it is decreed!" a herald said.\n\nBefore him crowded the denizens of Zimash, conversing with each other in the makeshift bazaar and listening to the latest of laws from the royal court being proclaimed from the base of a crumbled fountain. Some of these laws were met with uproarious approval, such as the subsidized reconstruction efforts and plans for registering families for relief, while a few others were condoned with jeering hisses and angry reeling of hooves. All in all, it was a constant back and forth between the crowd's approval and disapproval, while underneath the shade, the herald continued on.\n\nA nearby zebra muttered to his earth pony friend. "By Zal, how long as he been at it?"\n\nThe earth pony idly dug at the sand. "About an hour now."\n\n"Huh, well I gotta give him credit, that's impressive."\n\n"To better conserve our dwindling resources, a national limit of two alcoholic drinks per creature, per week, will be imposed, by Warzena's highest, it is decreed!"\n\nThe zebra, earth pony, and many others around them immediately erupted in boos and hisses.\n\n"To compensate for this restriction, homebrewing has been permitted with private sales, by Warzena's highest, it is decreed!"\n\nThe flustering confusion of condemning and cheering continued on." #Ardent Custodian
 warzena.22.a:0 "At least there is some order for now."

 warzena.23.t:0 "Traitors In Our Midst?"
 warzena.23.d:0 "King Barekzamal VII quietly observed the members of the royal court in the grand, musty room, vaguely listening to the ongoing debate while more poignantly focused on each of their expressions. For his lack of experience as a ruler, he was very aware that there were still those who sought to undermine and treasonously subvert his authority. The members of CAMO had somehow received too many undisclosed details on his future plans for the kingdom, and as a result, were able to present commendable counterproposals. Now with him slated to officially become the head of Warzena and many of their plans rejected, Barekzamal pondered how soon until CAMO or others began considering more extreme measures, if they weren't already.\n\nThe King continued to slowly shift his gaze. His eyes were briefly met by another pair already glancing his way before their owner quickly returned their attention back to the debate between court members. Exactly how much of the royal court were for or against him? How many were indifferent? How many could be swayed and how many would need to be taken care of?\n\nThe royal zebra adjusted to a more comfortable position in his seat. A precedence would have to be taken care of quickly and carefully. Though from what his friends had said about him before this whole kingship ordeal, King Barekzamal VII believed he had just enough charisma and amicability to take care of it; or at least to ensure the filtration started properly." #Ardent Custodian

 warzena.24.t:0 "Bleak Benevolence" #ToastedButter
 warzena.24.d:0 "Barekzamal VII walked in an apprehensive trudge throughout the halls of the palace. There was little he could do to try and walk away clean. Traitors from within and without, that was always the justification. If tonight was to go as planned, then he would sign many zebras 'out of the picture'.\n\nHis thoughts were broken up by a royal messenger. He was delivered a notice that left him petrified. Municipal leaders and police commissioners had arrived and they were expecting him to approve of their door-bucking campaign. Barekzamal gathered himself. He waved the messenger away while he made the slow and tenuous walk to the throne room.\n\nHe cautiously opened the doors with false confidence. The zebras of the room bowed. The king begrudgingly took a seat on the throne, his stomach turning at what was to come. Intrusive thoughts unfolded in his mind as he contemplated the situation. They had been on the brink once before. Since then, they have worked tirelessly to cure their blighted kingdom. The bleak sacrifices made in the past led them to this point. If he called the raids off, it might cascade and force them back to the edge. There was no option other than to bloody the hooves of the monarchy once more.\n\nHe delivered his decision to the small crowd. After the doors closed behind them, he sat in silence praying it would go well."
 warzena.24.a:0 "Praying it would be the last."

 warzena.25.t:0 "A Proper Coronation"
 warzena.25.d:0 "Warzena's denizens packed the ancient streets of Zamivgazal, filling the dry air with excited jubilation. Merchants vended their best wares, while musicians filled the streets and squares with the liveliest of tunes as entertainers and dancers performed besides them. The aroma of freshly cooking foods permeated the atmosphere, deliciously blending the scents of individual dishes into the fervent bouquet of a grandiose feast. Exuberant foals galloped in play through the lavishly decorated streets and weaved through the crowds making their way closer and closer to the capital's center. Here gathered the multitudes of Warzena, eager as ever to be present and witnessing true history in the making.\n\nThe only ones who looked less than pleased were the many guards patrolling the streets and stationed throughout the King's domicile, though if asked why, the general consensus would be because they weren't off-duty to enjoy the celebrations.\n\nAll the clamor in the central square fell into hushes and prayers at the sight of Warzena's highest priest stepping out onto the royal balcony. She soon beckoned forth and the boisterous rhythm of the royal orchestra rang out to thundering drums. With a last holy gesture, she stepped aside, and from behind stepped forth their official ruler.\n\nKing Barekzamal VII lifted a hoof and waved with a smile towards the crowd below unbridled in celebration. Despite having held the position long before today, he couldn't deny the symbolic grandeur of the coronation and all that it meant for Warzena. The future was to begin, and he would lead its way." #Ardent Custodian

 warzena.26.t:0 "Joint Training with Warzena?"
 warzena.26.d:0 "We were recently contacted by the Warzenan high command, offering to participate in a series of wargames so that they may learn from our military. It may help us put theory into practice, and give our troops more experience against outdated militaries. However, is it worth providing Warzena insights into our doctrine?"
 warzena.26.a:0 "Of course!"
 warzena.26.b:0 "We'd rather not share our secrets."

 warzena.27.t:0 "Hippogriffia Agrees!"
 warzena.27.d:0 "The hippogriffs accepted our proposal, and we soon agreed on a site. Once our troops arrived, they began to practice engagements with the hippogriffs. As the troops mixed in with each other, Warzenan forces initially underperformed, but the hippogriffs were more than happy to teach them, with playful banter on both sides. Our soldiers came away from the games with a better understanding of modern warfare, and a new appreciation for the hippogriffs and their unique culture."
 warzena.27.a:0 "An invaluable learning experience."

 warzena.28.t:0 "Hippogriffia Refuses"
 warzena.28.d:0 "The hippogriffs have politely declined our suggestion to engage in wargames together. Unfortunate, considering their military's advanced tactics would have been invaluable for our troops, but it seems that we'll have to learn on our own."
 warzena.28.a:0 "Shame."

 warzena.29.t:0 "The Remaining Threat"
 warzena.29.d:0 "Worrisome reports have come in lately, detailing activity by former members of CAMO we had previously thought to be neutralized. In particular, the leaders of CAMO's more extreme factions have apparently become more aggressive, having been freed of the restraint of their moderate counterparts. On the one hoof, this lack of coordination is useful in preventing these elements from being able to front an effective opposition to our authority. On the other hoof however, it has made them much more cautious, which, combined with the aforementioned aggression, has made them a particularly painful thorn in our side.\n\nThe most active of the radicals are the WCP and the HSNP, the forefront of CAMO's radical left and right wing movements, respectively. Zaniiaton, head of the WCP, was one of the few CAMO members we were completely unable to trail, as she seems to blend into the countryside, like a ghost in the shadows. It seems that she has grown even more discreet, staking out careful, but effective, raids on our posts and towns. If she is not dealt with soon, unrest may begin to grow in the rural regions. Meanwhile, the HSNP's Bennoam Shimzel is a character that we have had no problem tracking, but his connections to officials have kept him safe, while his remaining followers, zealous in their devotion, have always managed to skirt him away to safety when all else failed. Should this continue, Shimzel may yet be able to regain his footing and continue to challenge our rule.\n\nMeanwhile, CAMO's other factions have not entirely disappeared either. Although Itthozamal Ankeper, former head of the WRL, has been dealt with, many of his allies have managed to escape and have since banded with other moderate elements to form the League for a Free Warzena, which has continued to operate in secret. Although not as bellicose as their erstwhile radical allies, the LFW is still a problem that will have to be dealt with, lest all our hard work is undone and our sacrifices made futile."

 warzena.30.d:0 "It has become apparent to us that the situation on North Zebrica has evolved not necessarily to our advantage. Isolation had kept us safe in the past, but the world is a different place now. Tobuck, once the cornerstone of our economy has fallen into foreign hooves, posing a great threat to the nation. But perhaps most alarmingly, is the rising threat of Chiropterra to the west. Once content to plot within their mountains, they have now grown bolder and more aggressive, and now seem poised to launch a great offensive on the region. In this ever more dangerous world, it is imperative that we play our cards right if we want to survive the coming storm."

 warzena.31.t:0 "The King's Speech"
 warzena.31.d:0 "King Barekzamal VII stood before an assembly his exiled troops. His heart trembled with fear, but he had to put on appear brave. These were HIS warriors, their mismatched equipment and raggedy uniforms betrayed their desperation, but their eyes were determined, fixed on their king.\n\n"Good morning, my friends." He said.\n\n"Once again, the boots of tyranny stomp about our ancient land. Legions of foreign oppressors march over our fields and proclaim that our Kingdom is no more. But they are mistaken. In their blind aggression, they have made the same misjudgement as every invader from the Quaggatai to the Storm King. For, Warzena is not a Kingdom of fields, or forests, or rivers, or mountains. We are not a kingdom of land, we are a kingdom of people, and our people simply cannot be stamped out by military boots. So long as one zebra lives to teach his children what it means to be Warzenan, then Warzena is not yet lost."\n\n"I am one Zebra. As a ruler... as a father, I cannot sit idly by and watch everything we've built for our children be destroyed. I swear by Zal and Zanit that I shall fight. For our homes, for families, for our faith, for our very right to exist. So long as my people are subjected to foreign tyranny, I shall never stop fighting!"\n\n"Will you fight with me?""
 warzena.31.a:0 "The crowd broke into cheers!"

 warzena.32.t:0 "Hippogriffian Aid"
 warzena.32.d:0 "As we continue to strengthen our bonds with the hippogriffs, it may be prudent to utilize them for some sort of material benefit. Sure, friendship is its own reward, but substantial gains don't hurt either. If we petition the hippogriffs persuasively enough, we may be able to get them to share some of their technological advances with us. Many in the court hope that we can acquire more sophisticated arms blueprints in order to improve the quality of our armed forces. A rather vocal minority has suggested that we instead lobby the hippogriffs for insights into armoured vehicles so that we can field an advanced mechanized army. These militaristic factions have been met a clique interested in procuring more advanced manufacturing methods in order to streamline our production lines and expand our industrial output.\n\nUltimately, it seems that we may only have the capacity to lobby for just one advancement, so we should choose with abundant discretion. After all, who knows when we'll get another chance like this?"
 warzena.32.a:0 "Tanks sound interesting."
 warzena.32.b:0 "Our arms need some improvement."

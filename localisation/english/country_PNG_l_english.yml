 PNG_king_charlton: "Charlton"
 PNG_king_charlton_desc: "Charlton hatched during an age of peace and prosperity. His family was a dynasty of cryomancers, but his grandmother had fought in the brutal wars against the griffon colonists. As such, Charlton's father made sure to raise him not only as a skilled cryomancer, but also as a true patriot who would never trust a griffon or forgive them for what they had done to his grandma.\n\nWhen he grew up, he had no plans besides to follow in his ancestors' footsteps. This changed after the events of 978, which caused a domino effect that first collapsed the Nova Griffonian economy and then the penguin one. Being a young adult during the Decade of Poverty was difficult, but it gave him newfound purpose. Thanks to his father's connections, he managed to join a political movement advocating for the severing of relations with the griffons. What followed was a meteoric rise in fame, as his scathing writings condeming the rule of Queen Edith were published in newspapers, printed on pamphlets and spread across the Kingdom. The popularity even resulted in him getting married.\n\nWhen Edith died in 989, the Council of Elders was strongly lobbied by the armed forces to elect the popular firebrand Charlton as King, believing they could also control him. He immediately went to work, reverting many policies of the previous ruler. This started the famed Decade of Recovery. But not all was well for Charlton. His wife divorced him, leaving him to take care of his son Edgar alone after he hatched in 993. Afterwards he delegated his responsibilities to his ministers (most of whom were his supporters from the military) as he focused on raising his son instead.\n\nIt was during this difficult period in his life that Charlton was introduced to radical politics from a series of books that inspired him with grand ideas of revival of the spirit of the penguin race and the reclamation of land lost to griffons. He once again returned to active politics in the new millenium, starting a rearmament program and funding confidential thaumaturgical research projects. His radicalism surprised even the military. This came at a cost, however, as he had to neglect his son more and more. This may have consequences that he might not be prepared for."
 PNG_agnes: "Agnes"
 PNG_agnes_desc:0 "Without Agnes, Charlton would have never become King. It was her who realized his potential as a firebrand who could stir the masses, and it was her who pushed the Council of Elders to elect him as King. In return, she got what she had wanted, the second most powerful political position in the Kingdom. And when Charlton became a single father, she gained the responsibility of running the country.\n\nShe would've never imagined that one day, Charlton would not only return to active politics, but stop following her instructions almost entirely. While she retains her position, her actual influence has been reduced gradually as Charlton becomes more and more of an autocrat with his own ambitions, which Agnes does not comprehend.\n\nBefore becoming chief minister, she was once a soldier, then an officer, then a high-ranking general. She had long been dissatisfied with "cowardly" policies of Queen Edith, yet was well aware that she would have to be replaced by legitimate means to preserve the nation's stability. She founded a political movement called Saviours of Penguinkind, but relied heavily on finding talented individuals to actually make it successful.\n\nShe has always lacked charisma, and now she has become old as well. She once believed to be in control, but now she's realizing that might've never been the case."

 # National spirits/ideas
 PNG_communist_agitators: "Communist Agitators"
 PNG_communist_agitators_desc: "Economic mobilization and conscription have made many working-class penguins rather upset. Communist agitators, likely supported by Stalliongrad, have capitalized on this opportunity, spreading vile propaganda and riling up the commoners."
 PNG_rearmament_program: "National Rearmament Program"
 PNG_rearmament_program_desc: "Already launched in 995 ALB by King Charlton's militarist ministers, the National Rearmament Program has been greatly expanded in recent years. The NRP aims to increase the size of the penguin military, to "safeguard the realm against foreign threats", primarily by mobilizing the economy and pouring funds into jingoistic propaganda."
 PNG_treaty_of_boreasfjord: "The Treaty of Boreasfjord"
 PNG_treaty_of_boreasfjord_desc: "Signed in 914 ALB by Queen Edith, the Treaty of Boreasfjord acknowledged the region of the Frozen North as lawful Nova Griffonian territory, granted the griffons full fishing rights in penguin waters, and removed all barriers on trade and investments between the two countries. While this ensured peace between the two nations and stimulated rapid industrialization and growth, the economic troubles of Nova Griffonia following the collapse of the Griffonian Empire in 978 ALB have made the treaty rather unpopular among the populace. King Charlton has actively tried to work around the treaty, but for now it remains in effect."
 
 PNG_recruitment_campaign_idea: "Recruitment Campaign"

 # Focussies
 PNG_meeting_advisors: "Meet With the Royal Ministers"
 PNG_meeting_advisors_desc: "My trusted ministers have expressed concerns about my plans and have requested a meeting. Of course, getting all five of the most important and powerful penguins in the Kingdom to be in the same room at the same time is a scheduling nightmare, so it is unfortunately going to take a while. I will use this convenient time to ensure everything will proceed exactly as I have planned."
 
 PNG_recruitment_campaign: "Launch a Recruitment Campaign"
 PNG_recruitment_campaign_desc: "Though our population might be small, we can compensate for it by recruiting a larger portion of the populace into the army. Besides, an army might have all the weapons and fortifications in the world, but without soldiers to use them, they are all worthless. Generous payouts should motivate enough penguins to enlist without having to rely solely on conscription."
 PNG_mil_industry: "Rapid Expansion of Arms Production"
 PNG_mil_industry_desc: "A penguin without a weapon is not much of a threat to anycreature. For the coming war, a reliable domestic supply of armaments is essential. I shall pour royal funds into the expansion of arms manufactories owned both by the crown and by private companies. Whoever calls it a waste of money does not comprehend that this is a matter of our survival."
 PNG_lower_standards: "Lower Training Standards"
 PNG_lower_standards_desc: "The window of opportunity is limited, as in time our enemy can no doubt leverage their greater potential and reform their ragtag army of militias. Thus I need as many units out in the field as possible. I do not care if they are experts of war, I simply need penguins with rifles in their flippers to occupy the frontline."

 PNG_galtung_state_desc:0 "When peace was made between penguins and polar bears in 312 ALB, Clan Galtung swore an oath of eternal loyalty to the Queen of the Penguins. This oath has never been broken, and to this day the polar bears of Galtung serve their overlords. The clan is convinced that the cryomantic abilities of the penguins is proof of their divinity, and thus have no desire for independence, as long as they continue to be treated fairly."

 # Events
 penguin.1.t: "Project WINDIGO Annual Review"
 penguin.1.d: ""Attention!" shouted the penguin guard, standing like a formidable pillar with a rifle resting on her shoulder. "The King is coming."\n   All the penguins inside the laboratory stared at the guard in shock. Then, in an instant, they exploded into motion, cleaning the tables and the floor, putting the chairs back in place and straightening their lab coats. But before they could finish, the guard at the door stepped aside, and King Charlton appeared.\n   He smiled as the penguins inside stared at him, frozen in place. "Happy Hearth's Warming, everypenguin!" he exclaimed in a humorous tone.\n   There was a collective sigh of relief as the penguins relaxed. One of them, wearing round thick glasses, hurried to him. "Oh your highness, we didn't expect you so soon! You didn't specify your time of arrival in your message earlier, and we were right in the middle of—"\n   Charlton raised his flipper. "Yes, Bertram, I wanted to surprise you all." Then he chuckled. "Seems I succeeded."\n   The scientist sighed. "I am glad you're in a good mood today, your highness. I hope this review doesn't dampen it."\n   Charlton's smile vanished in an instant. "What, do you have bad news to share? Exactly one year ago, it seemed you were making great progress!"\n   "Yes, we were, but the field demonstration isn't ready for today, I am afraid..."\n   "Hrm." The King nodded, frowning deeply. "When do you think it will be?"\n   "We'll try to get it ready within two moons! Promise!"\n   Charlton's eyes drifted away as he rubbed his chin with his flipper. "Should not be too bad then, if you truly believe you can get everything done four moons after that."\n   Bertram gulped. "Yes, we'll do our best, working around the clock if needed!"\n   "Remember, if you need any extra resources, simply send a request and I shall approve it. I want the project to remain on schedule."\n   The scientist nodded almost frantically. "Yes, I know, I know. Sorry we couldn't get the demonstration ready for today. I'm aware it's an important date, the four-year anniversary of the project's start date, but we simply couldn't get the machine to meet our high standards."\n   "It is fine, Bertram. The date is merely a symbolic one. Back then, I figured that the foolish pony holiday celebrating the banishment of the Windigoes was appropriate, considering the name of the project. Now, how about we proceed with the annual review?""
 penguin.1.a: ""Yes, your highness.""
 
 penguin.2.t: "A Change of Course?"
 penguin.2.d: "King Charlton's seat, delicately carved from ice, cracked beneath his weight. He glared at it and grunted. "I will have to get that replaced."\n   The four ministers seated around the table glanced at each other without saying a word.\n   Charlton lifted his gaze and looked at each of them with a polite smile. "So, gentlepenguins, shall we formally begin the meeting?"\n   "Yes, it's taken long enough," said the chief minister, Agnes, who then sighed with exasperation.\n   The minister of faith and justice, Theodore, then continued: "The agenda of this long-delayed meeting concerns your plans for the next winter. We unanimously recommend you to reconsider them."\n   Instantly Charlton's smile melted into a frown. "Reconsider them? At this late stage?"\n   "Maybe if you had met us earlier, it wouldn't be late," complained the minister of war, Hildred. "Anyways, my personal concern is that the military simply isn't ready yet. We need more time."\n   As the King glared at her, the Minister of revenue and public works, Edmund, also spoke: "The economy isn't ready either, your highness. We're simply not producing enough armaments to sustain a long conflict."\n   Charlton curled his flipper into a fist-like shape and slammed it on the ice table, cracking it too. The ministers went silent. "Enough! It is never going to be enough, no matter how long we wait. We have to strike as soon as possible, or we risk losing our greatest advantage, the element of surprise! Did I not explain all this to you fools before? We must take a risk."\n   "Please, your highness," pleaded Agnes in a much more desperate and conciliatory tone, "At least consider our alternative proposal!"\n   "It is a simple strategy of divide and conquer," Hildred continued. "Our enemy's political climate is already unstable. If we further drive a wedge into their society, they will fall into chaos and we can take advantage of it with much less risk."\n   "And by then, our war chest would be much more full too!" Edmund added, rubbing his flippers together.\n   Still glaring at them, Charlton nevertheless stroked the underside of his beak in thought."
 penguin.2.a: "Delay the war until an opportunity presents itself."
 penguin.2.b: "Proceed as planned."
 
 penguin.3.t: "Friends"
 penguin.3.d: "A young griffon with golden feathers stood at the entrance to "Griffontown", the only part of Thule where buildings were made out of bricks, stone and wood instead of ice. He looked at penguins nearby waddling and sliding on their bellies with a smile, finding it amusing to look at. Then he saw a group of three penguins approaching him. Two of them were uniformed guards with rifles, and one was a young white and grey penguin who has barely half their size. The griffon raised his claw and waved to them. The teenager penguin said something to the other two, then left them behind and quickly waddled to him. "Hi, Edgar!" the griffon said happily in his squeaky voice."\n   "Hello, Sunny, how have you been?" the penguin replied, his voice hoarse and crackling, a sign of puberty.\n   "Let's talk about that later. Come, I wanna show you that restaurant I talked about!"\n   "Very well..."\n\nSoon enough the two were seated at an ethnic restaurant, sharing a meal of steamed fish. "So, can you talk about how you have been now?" Edgar asked right after Sunny swallowed a forkful.\n   "Oh, um, yeah sure. Uh... actually, you heard of what happened at Weter Street last week?"\n   Egdar looked at him with concern. "You are dodging the question, what is wrong? You can tell me."\n   The griffon sighed. "Okay fine... my family's just been... thinking about moving back to Nova."\n   The penguin's eyes widened. "What? But why?"\n   "We're just worried. Your dad's passing new laws all the time making our life harder. I'm not sure it's safe for us to stay here..."\n   Edgar tried to offer a comforting smile. "Do not worry, friend, it is going to be fine. If needed, I can always talk to my father. I am certain he will listen to me.""
 penguin.3.a: "Sunny smiled back, and the two continued to eat."
 
 penguin.4.t: "Live Demonstration"
 penguin.4.d: ""When you said within two moons, I did not expect you to cut it this close," Charlton grumbled as he followed Bertram down an icy hallway.\n   The scientist chuckled anxiously and glanced at him. "Well, I still kept my promise, didn't I?"\n   The King nodded. "I trust you have done a good job. Let us see the fruits of your labour, then."\n   The two entered a large room, with a throne of ice and a large shimmering machine of frozen metal with a brass horn on top of it. In front of the throne was a staff attached to the floor, with a blue crystal on its tip.\n   Bertram gestured towards the throne. "Please, sit down. It was made specifically for you."\n   He smiled, then waddled to the seat. "I must appreciate your attention to detail." However, as he sat down, he didn't quite fit, and had to squeeze himself slightly in between the armrests.\n   Bertram immediately looked alarmed. "Oh, it seems you... uh, your size has changed recently. My apologies, we expected it to remain the same-"\n   Charlton waved him off dismissingly with his flipper. "It is fine, this puny chair is not important! How do I use the magical magnifier?"\n   Bertram paused to regain his focus. "Ahem. Right. It is very simple. You focus your powers on the crystal in front of you. Then, the device will amplify your energies and channel them through the horn as wind of pure frost."\n   The King nodded, wrapped his flipper firmly around the staff, and gazed intensely upon the crystal. His brow furrowed as his eyes started shining brightly with unnatural blue light. Magical energy burst out of his eyesockets, hitting the crystal directly. Soon the machine whirred to life, and cold wind blew out of the horn. The room's temperature immediately dropped to freezing cold.\n   This made Betram shiver, despite his thick layer of insulating feathers. "S-see, it works! W-within a few s-seconds, t-this tiny r-r-room is..." He checked a thermometer on the wall. "...F-fifty centigrades negative! Y-you can stop now!"\n   Charlton's eyes stopped glowing, and the machine went quiet. "Excellent. Negafook, the Spirit of the North Wind, has blessed us all." Unfazed by the cold, he turned to look at Betram with his ice-cold glare. "But. Do you think you can accomplish your goal by next summer? Will it all work as I requested?"\n   Betram rubbed himself with his flippers to warm himself up. "Y-yes, we've already been working on scaling up the technology. According to my calculations, it should have the desired effect, as long as we build enough machines.""
 penguin.4.a: "Charlton grinned and nodded."

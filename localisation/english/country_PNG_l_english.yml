 PNG_king_charlton: "Charlton"
 PNG_king_charlton_desc: "Charlton hatched during an age of peace and prosperity. He came from a dynasty of cryomancers, but his grandmother had fought in the brutal wars against the griffon colonists. As such, Charlton's father made sure to raise him not only as a skilled cryomancer, but also as a true patriot who would never forget or forgive what the griffons had done.\n\nWhen he grew up, he planned to simply follow in his ancestors' footsteps. This changed after the events of 978, which caused a domino effect that first collapsed the Nova Griffonian economy and then the penguin one. Being a young adult during the Decade of Poverty was difficult, but it gave him newfound purpose. Thanks to his father's connections, he managed to join an anti-griffon political movement. What followed was a meteoric rise in fame, as his scathing writings condemning the rule of Queen Edith were spread across the Kingdom. The popularity even resulted in him getting married.\n\nWhen Edith finally died in 989, the Council of Elders was strongly lobbied by the armed forces to elect the popular firebrand Charlton as king, as they believed they could easily control him. He immediately went to work, reverting many policies of the previous ruler. This started the famed Decade of Recovery. But not all went well for Charlton. His wife divorced him in 993, leaving him to take care of his newly hatched son Edgar alone. As he focused on being a father, he delegated most of his responsibilities to his ministers.\n\nIt was during this difficult period in his life that Charlton was introduced to radical politics by a series of books that inspired him with grand ideas about the reclamation of land lost to griffons. In 1003, he once again returned to active politics, funding a rearmament program and confidential thaumaturgical research projects. His sudden radicalism surprised even the military. All this came at a cost, however, as he had to neglect his son more and more. This may have consequences that he might not be prepared for."
 PNG_agnes: "Agnes"
 PNG_agnes_desc:0 "Without Agnes, Charlton would have never become king. It was she who realized his potential as a firebrand who could stir the masses, and it was she who pushed the Council of Elders to elect him as king. In return, she got what she had wanted, the second most powerful political position in the Kingdom. And when Charlton became a single father, she gained all the powerful responsibility of running the country.\n\nShe would've never imagined that one day, Charlton would not only return to politics, but stop following her instructions entirely. While she retains her position, her actual influence has been gradually reduced to nothing as Charlton becomes more and more of an autocrat with his own ambitions, which Agnes does not comprehend.\n\nBefore becoming the chief minister, she was once a soldier, then an officer, then a high-ranking general. She had long been dissatisfied with "cowardly" policies of Queen Edith, yet was well aware that she would have to be replaced by legitimate means to preserve the nation's stability. She founded a political movement called Saviours of Penguinkind, but relied heavily on finding talented individuals to actually make it successful.\n\nShe has always lacked charisma, and now she has become old as well. She once believed to be in control, but now she's realizing that might've never been the case."

 # National spirits/ideas
 PNG_communist_agitators: "Communist Agitators"
 PNG_communist_agitators_desc: "Economic mobilization and conscription have made many working-class penguins rather upset. Communist agitators, likely supported by Stalliongrad, have capitalized on this opportunity, spreading vile propaganda and riling up the commoners."
 PNG_rearmament_program: "National Rearmament Program"
 PNG_rearmament_program_desc: "Already launched in 995 ALB by King Charlton's militarist ministers, the National Rearmament Program has been greatly expanded in recent years. The NRP aims to increase the size of the penguin military, to "safeguard the realm against foreign threats", primarily by mobilizing the economy and pouring funds into the arms industry and jingoistic propaganda."
 PNG_treaty_of_boreasfjord: "The Treaty of Boreasfjord"
 PNG_treaty_of_boreasfjord_desc: "Signed in 931 ALB by Queen Edith, the Treaty of Boreasfjord acknowledged the region of the Frozen North as lawful Nova Griffonian territory, granted the griffons full fishing rights in penguin waters, and removed all barriers on trade and investments between the two countries. While this ensured peace between the two nations and stimulated rapid industrialization and growth, the economic troubles of Nova Griffonia following the collapse of the Griffonian Empire in 978 ALB have made the treaty rather unpopular among the populace. King Charlton has actively tried to work around the treaty, but for now it remains in effect."

 PNG_lower_training_standards_desc: "As long as you know how to use a rifle and take cover, you're good enough."
 PNG_anti_griffon_laws_idea: "The Anti-Griffon Laws"
 PNG_anti_griffon_laws_idea_desc: "The very unsubtly named Anti-Griffon Laws has led to a rapid worsening of the conditions of the griffon minority in the Kingdom. Most notably, Griffontown in Thule has been fenced off, with guards checking anyone who comes and goes. All "racist and imperialist" griffon schools have been closed down. Communications by griffons are closely surveilled and anygriffon suspected of criminal activity is arrested. All this has driven many griffons to emigrate out of the country to Nova Griffonia."
 PNG_GRF_griffon_immigrants: "Griffon Refugees"
 PNG_GRF_griffon_immigrants_desc: "Griffons are fleeing persecution in the Kingdom of the Penguins and immigrating back to Nova Griffonia."
 PNG_propaganda_idea: "Media Propaganda"
 PNG_propaganda_idea_desc: "The penguin newspapers and radio stations all spread word of the crimes committed by Nova Griffonians and the threat they pose to the existence of penguinkind."
 
 # Focussies
 PNG_meeting_advisors: "Meet With the Royal Ministers"
 PNG_meeting_advisors_desc: "My trusted ministers have expressed concerns about my plans and have requested a meeting. Of course, getting all five of the most important and powerful penguins in the Kingdom to be in the same room at the same time is a scheduling nightmare, so it is unfortunately going to take a while. In the meantime, I will ensure everything will proceed exactly as I have planned."
 
 PNG_recruitment_campaign: "Launch a Recruitment Campaign"
 PNG_recruitment_campaign_desc: "Though our population might be small, we can compensate for it by recruiting a larger portion of the populace into the army. Besides, an army might have all the weapons and fortifications in the world, but without soldiers to use them, they are all worthless. Generous payouts should motivate enough penguins to enlist without having to rely solely on conscription."
 PNG_mil_industry: "Rapid Expansion of Arms Production"
 PNG_mil_industry_desc: "A penguin without a weapon is not much of a threat to anycreature. For the coming war, a reliable domestic supply of armaments is essential. I shall pour royal funds into the expansion of arms manufactories owned both by the crown and by private companies. Whoever calls it a waste of money does not comprehend that this is a matter of our survival."
 PNG_lower_standards: "Lower Training Standards"
 PNG_lower_standards_desc: "The window of opportunity is limited, as in time our enemy can no doubt leverage their greater socioeconomic potential and reform their ragtag army of militias. Thus I need as many units out in the field as possible. I do not care if they are experts of war, I simply need penguins with rifles in their flippers to occupy the frontline."
 PNG_anti_griffon_laws: "Pass The Anti-Griffon Laws"
 PNG_anti_griffon_laws_desc: "The griffon minority in our Kingdom is a potential fifth column. Any conflict with the imperialist colonizers would result in these traitors showing their true colours, sabotaging our defensive efforts and putting our survival in jeopardy. But I know what I must do. Pre-emptive action will be taken to ensure these four-legged catbirds pose no threat to us at all."

 # Events
 penguin.1.t: "Project WINDIGO Annual Review"
 penguin.1.d: ""Attention!" shouted the penguin guard, standing like a formidable pillar with a rifle resting on her shoulder. "The King is coming."\n   All the penguins inside the laboratory stared at the guard in shock. Then, in an instant, they exploded into motion, cleaning the tables and the floor, putting the chairs back in place and straightening their lab coats. But before they could finish, the guard at the door stepped aside, and King Charlton appeared.\n   He smiled as the penguins inside stared at him, frozen in place. "Happy Hearth's Warming, everypenguin!" he exclaimed in a humorous tone.\n   There was a collective sigh of relief as the penguins relaxed. One of them, wearing round thick glasses, hurried to him. "Oh your highness, we didn't expect you so soon! You didn't specify your time of arrival in your message earlier, and we were right in the middle of—"\n   Charlton raised his flipper. "Yes, Bertram, I wanted to surprise you all." Then he chuckled. "Seems I succeeded."\n   The scientist sighed. "I am glad you're in a good mood today, your highness. I hope this review doesn't dampen it."\n   Charlton's smile vanished in an instant. "What, do you have bad news to share? Exactly one year ago, it seemed you were making great progress!"\n   "Yes, we were, but the field demonstration isn't ready for today, I am afraid..."\n   "Hrm." The King nodded, frowning deeply. "When do you think it will be?"\n   "We'll try to get it ready within two moons! Promise!"\n   Charlton's eyes drifted away as he rubbed his chin with his flipper. "Should not be too bad then, if you truly believe you can get everything done four moons after that."\n   Bertram gulped. "Yes, we'll do our best, working around the clock if needed!"\n   "Remember, if you need any extra resources, simply send a request and I shall approve it. I want the project to remain on schedule."\n   The scientist nodded almost frantically. "Yes, I know, I know. Sorry we couldn't get the demonstration ready for today. I'm aware it's an important date, the four-year anniversary of the project's start date, but we simply couldn't get the machine to meet our high standards."\n   "It is fine, Bertram. The date is merely a symbolic one. Back then, I figured that the foolish pony holiday celebrating the banishment of the windigoes was appropriate, considering the name of the project. Now, how about we proceed with the annual review?""
 penguin.1.a: ""Yes, your highness.""
 
 penguin.2.t: "A Change of Course?"
 penguin.2.d: "King Charlton's seat, delicately carved from ice, cracked beneath his weight. He glared at it and grunted. "I will have to get that replaced."\n   The four ministers seated around the table glanced at each other without saying a word.\n   Charlton lifted his gaze and looked at each of them with a polite smile. "So, gentlepenguins, shall we formally begin the meeting?"\n   "Yes, it's taken long enough," said the chief minister, Agnes, who then sighed with exasperation.\n   The minister of faith and justice, Theodore, then continued: "The agenda of this long-delayed meeting concerns your plans for the next winter. We unanimously recommend you to reconsider them."\n   Instantly Charlton's smile melted into a frown. "Reconsider them? At this late stage?"\n   "Maybe if you had met us earlier, it wouldn't be late," complained the minister of war, Hildred. "Anyways, my personal concern is that the military simply isn't ready yet. We need more time."\n   As the King glared at her, the Minister of revenue and public works, Edmund, also spoke: "The economy isn't ready either, your highness. We're simply not producing enough armaments to sustain a long conflict."\n   Charlton curled his flipper into a fist-like shape and slammed it on the ice table, cracking it too. The ministers went silent. "Enough! It is never going to be enough, no matter how long we wait. We have to strike as soon as possible, or we risk losing our greatest advantage, the element of surprise! Did I not explain all this to you fools before? We must take a risk."\n   "Please, your highness," pleaded Agnes in a much more desperate and conciliatory tone, "At least consider our alternative proposal!"\n   "It is a simple strategy of divide and conquer," Hildred continued. "Our enemy's political climate is already unstable. If we further drive a wedge into their society, they will fall into chaos and we can take advantage of it with much less risk."\n   "And by then, our war chest would be much more full too!" Edmund added, rubbing his flippers together.\n   Still glaring at them, Charlton nevertheless stroked the underside of his beak in thought."
 penguin.2.a: "Delay the war until an opportunity presents itself."
 penguin.2.b: "Proceed as planned."
 
 penguin.3.t: "Friends"
 penguin.3.d: "A young griffon with golden feathers stood at the entrance to "Griffontown", the only part of Thule where buildings were made out of bricks, stone and wood instead of ice. He looked at penguins nearby waddling and sliding on their bellies with a smile, finding it amusing to look at. Then he saw a group of three penguins approaching him. Two of them were uniformed guards with rifles, and one was a young white and grey penguin who has barely half their size. The griffon raised his claw and waved to them. The teenager penguin said something to the other two, then left them behind and quickly waddled to him. "Hi, Edgar!" the griffon said happily in his squeaky voice."\n   "Hello, Sunny, how have you been?" the penguin replied, his voice hoarse and crackling, a sign of puberty.\n   "Let's talk about that later. Come, I wanna show you that restaurant I talked about!"\n   "Very well..."\n\nSoon enough the two were seated at an ethnic griffon restaurant, sharing a meal of steamed fish. "So, can you talk about how you have been now?" Edgar asked right after Sunny swallowed a forkful.\n   "Oh, um, yeah sure. Uh... actually, you heard of what happened at Weter Street last week?"\n   Egdar looked at him with concern. "You are dodging the question, what is wrong? You can tell me."\n   The griffon sighed. "Okay fine... my family's just been... thinking about moving back to Nova."\n   The penguin's eyes widened. "What? But why?"\n   "We're just worried. Your dad's passing new laws all the time making our life harder. I'm not sure it's safe for us to stay here..."\n   Edgar tried to offer a comforting smile. "Do not worry, friend, it is going to be fine. If needed, we can always try to talk to my father. I know he doesn't really... like you griffons, but I'm sure he'll listen to us!""
 penguin.3.a: "Sunny smiled back, and the two continued to eat."
 
 penguin.4.t: "Live Demonstration"
 penguin.4.d: ""When you said within two moons, I did not expect you to cut it this close," Charlton grumbled as he followed Bertram down an icy hallway.\n   The scientist chuckled anxiously and glanced at him. "Well, I still kept my promise, didn't I?"\n   The King nodded. "I trust you have done a good job. Let us see the fruits of your labour, then."\n   The two entered a large room, with a throne of ice and a large shimmering machine of frozen metal with a brass horn on top of it. In front of the throne was a staff attached to the floor, with a blue crystal on its tip.\n   Bertram gestured towards the throne. "Please, sit down. It was made specifically for you."\n   He smiled, then waddled to the seat. "I must appreciate your attention to detail." However, as he sat down, he didn't quite fit, and had to squeeze himself slightly in between the armrests.\n   Bertram immediately looked alarmed. "Oh, it seems you... uh, your size has changed recently. My apologies, we expected it to remain the same-"\n   Charlton waved him off dismissingly with his flipper. "It is fine, this puny chair is not important! How do I use the magical magnifier?"\n   Bertram paused to regain his focus. "Ahem. Right. It is very simple. You focus your powers on the crystal in front of you. Then, the device will amplify your energies and channel them through the horn as wind of pure frost."\n   The King nodded, wrapped his flipper firmly around the staff, and gazed intensely upon the crystal. His brow furrowed as his eyes started shining brightly with unnatural blue light. Magical energy burst out of his eyesockets, hitting the crystal directly. Soon the machine whirred to life, and cold wind blew out of the horn. The room's temperature immediately dropped to freezing cold.\n   This made Bertram shiver, despite his thick layer of insulating feathers. "S-see, it works! W-within a few s-seconds, t-this tiny r-r-room is..." He checked a thermometer on the wall. "...F-fifty centigrades negative! Y-you can stop now!"\n   Charlton's eyes stopped glowing, and the machine went quiet. "Excellent. Negafook, the Spirit of the North Wind, has blessed us all." Unfazed by the cold, he turned to look at Bertram with his ice-cold glare. "But. Do you think you can accomplish your goal by next summer? Will it all work as I requested?"\n   Bertram rubbed himself with his flippers to warm himself up. "Y-yes, we've already been working on scaling up the technology. According to my calculations, it should have the desired effect, as long as we build enough machines.""
 penguin.4.a: "Charlton grinned and nodded."
 
 penguin.5.t: "It's Always Sunny"
 penguin.5.d: "Charlton sat upon a frozen throne and smiled when Edgar finally arrived. However, his smile dissipated when he saw a young griffon with golden feathers besides him.\n   "Hello, father," Edgar said in a formal, polite tone.\n   "Greetings, my son," Charlton said with a furrowed brow.\n   The young penguin gestured towards the griffon with his flipper. "This is Sunny, my friend. We came here to ask why you're making life so difficult for griffons."\n   "Yeah, my whole family is packing to go south to Nova Griffonia!" Sunny added.\n   As Charlton looked at Sunny, he started smiling again, though there was uncomfortable intensity in his eyes. "Do not bother packing. Soon, there will be no Nova Griffonia for your family to go to." Then he stood up from his throne, standing twice as tall than either of the teenagers. He curled his flipper and raised it into the air, puffing out his chest. "Soon, there will be no place for anyone, but us penguins!" He sat back down on his throne with a grin. "Soon enough, the whole world will be frozen over. And you, Egdar, will inherit that world when you become king."\n   Both Egdar and Sunny stared at him with their beaks wide open. "No, father!" Edgar exclaimed in shock.\n   Again, Charlton's smile was gone. "WHAT?!" he shouted, glaring at his son.\n    Sunny was so startled that he hid behind Edgar, who nevertheless stepped forward. "I don't want to rule a world like that! And even if I did, it wouldn't be right!" Despite his words, his voice made it clear he was trying not to cry.\n    Charlton stood up again, looming above the two. "When you are king, you may decide what is and is not right!" he said, pointing at Edgar, but then slammed his own chest with a curled flipper. "But I am king now, and what I say is LAW! Is that clear?"\n    "But why should only penguins live here?" Edgar asked.\n    "Y-yeah, what's wrong with being a griffon?" Sunny asked.\n    "They're weak," Charlton snarled. "Can they withstand the cold like we can? Do they have frozen souls like us?"\n    "Why should we have to?" Sunny asked in desperation.\n    Charlton glared at the griffon and said nothing. His eyes began to glow an ominous blue. Then, two beams of bright light burst out of them, enveloping Sunny and covering him in a thick layer of ice in an instant.\n    "SUNNY!" Edgar screamed and started crying.\n    "He's been a bad influence on you," Charlton muttered. "You will not be listening to his nonsense anymore."\n    "H-how could you?!" his son asked.\n    "When you are king, you will understand these things.""
 penguin.5.a: ""GUARDS! TAKE THIS BODY AWAY!""
 
 penguin.6.t: "Influx Of Griffon Refugees"
 penguin.6.d: "Reports have arrived from the northern border and the ports that hundreds, if not thousands, of griffons are fleeing from the Kingdom of the Penguins and moving to Nova Griffonia. Griffons have lived there for centuries, though most moved there during the reign of the penguin Queen Edith. Especially their capital of Thule has a sizeable griffon minority living in a quarter known as Griffontown. But according to our intelligence, the current King Charlton has passed laws persecuting griffons and increasing surveillance on them, making their lives increasingly difficult as they are accused of being foreign agents.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] has decided to issue a diplomatic protest, though there is not much else he can do besides making sure the immigrants and refugees are taken care of."
 penguin.6.a: "Outrageous!"
 
 penguin.7.t: "Weaving A Narrative"
 penguin.7.d_slow_and_steady: ""  #For example, if you find out about a crime committed by the Falcons of Griffonstone, amplify it, tell all about it, make it frontpage news. Especially if the victim if a penguin. Do not mention anything about the Nova Griffonian government trying to stop the Falcons. If Governor Teafeather makes a statement, interpret it in the most negative way possible.
 penguin.7.d_rush_war: "The owners of the Kingdom's most popular newspapers and radio stations, all of them penguins wearing tuxedos, sat around a table of ice. At the end of the table sat King Charlton himself. He smiled politely. "Now let us get into the heart of the matter. I summoned you here because I have a very vital task for each of you."\n    The other penguins exchanged anxious glances.\n    Charlton continued. "Despite all the efforts of the royal government, there seems to be a certain lack of urgency in our society. They do not seem to understand the grave threats we are facing. I believe it is your duty to inform the populace and ensure they are appropriately alarmed by the current situation."\n    One of the penguins raised a flipper. "But your royal majesty, there is nothing extraordinary to report, it is peaceful-"\n    The King frowned and interjected. "I know better than any of you what is happening. You would be wise to listen to my words, if you want to retain your publication and broadcasting licences."\n    The penguin who had talked snapped their beak shut.\n    "I am not asking you to lie, of course. I want you to take true events and put a spin on them, magnify them, exaggerate them. And ignore everything that does not fit the narrative. For example, report any activity by the Nova Griffonian militia. Make any training exercises sound like preparation for an attack. Interpret Governor Teafeather's statements in a way that makes it seem like he wants to end our independence. In summary, I am asking you to create an atmosphere of fear and imminent danger. Do you all understand?"\n    A penguin gulped, another shifted in her chair uncomfortably and looked at the exit, a third penguin stared at the King blankly. But a fourth penguin smiled and nodded. "Yes, yes I think I do. Sensational news will sell more, won't they? I think this can be a mutually beneficial agreement."\n    Charlton grinned. "Indeed. We all stand to gain here.""
 penguin.7.a: "Bad news travels faster."
 
 penguin.8.t: "Baby, It's Cold Outside"
 penguin.8.d: "Waves crashed against the rocky shores as Charlton admired the results of project WINDIGO in awe, smiling proudly. An array of gargantuan blower fans, made of both metal and ice, shimmered along the coastline, pointing directly south. "Truly a marvel of modern engineering and magic," Charlton mumbled.\n    "I am glad you're impressed by our hard work," Bertram said without sounding very glad at all. "Now come, everything is ready."\n\nThe two penguins waddled inside a building that was located behind the blowers. There, a series of magical magnifiers were lined up, each with a cryomancer seated behind it and waiting, except for one in the middle. That one was larger than the other ones and had a throne instead of a mere seat behind it.\n    "We uh, remade the throne to take into account your current bodymass," Bertram explained as he led Charlton towards it.\n    "Good. I must say, I am quite excited for this." The two waddled to the throne and the King tried to sit down, but once again he did not fit and had to squeeze in between the armrests.\n    "You gained even more weight?!" Bertram exclained, then cleared his throat. "Apologies, your majesty, we uh, we'll just remove the armrests later."\n    Charlton glared at him with an ice-cold stare. "It. Is. Fine. Like I said last time. Now, make sure everyone else is ready, and we can finally begin."\n    Bertram nodded and lied down on his belly, then slid across the icy floor to the control room. Soon enough, his voice could be heard from a loudspeaker. "Is everypenguin ready? We will begin in thirty seconds. Notify the staff if you are not."\n    Charlton looked at the crystal on top of the staff, then glanced at all the other cryomancers in the room. They, too, were staring at their crystals, ready to use their ice magic. Soon enough, all the most powerful ice mages in the Kingdom would channel all their power and bring an early end to the summer in Nova Griffonia. He grinned and turned back to stare at the crystal. Then, he could hear Bertram's voice from the loudspeaker:"
 penguin.8.a: ""Begin.""
 
 penguin.9.t: "Baby, It's Cold Outside"
 penguin.9.d: "Reports are coming from all across Nova Griffonia of a sudden drop in temperature, confirmed by multiple weather stations. Inexplicably, the temperature has dropped below zero almost everywhere, with multiple snowstorms confirmed. As everygriffon has been taken by complete surprise, no preparations for this kind of weather have been made. This year's harvest is in serious danger as crops are unlikely to survive the cold if it continues, countless homes are without any heating and road conditions have rapidly worsened. Meteorologists have no rational explanation for this event, though they say the weather is caused by strong northern winds.\n\nThere are no historical records of there ever snowing this much in the middle of summer. Unless, of course, pre-colonial records of pony history are taken into account. Over a thousand years ago, this land was inhabited by three pony tribes. Squabbles between the unicorn kingdom, the pegasus stratocracy and the earth pony republic caused magical windigoes to appear and feed upon their hatred, bringing extreme cold with them even in the middle of summer. So far, there are no sightings of these mythical creatures, so for now [Root.GetLeader] has decided to declare a state of emergency in the nation and wait for more information."
 penguin.9.a: "Have the windigoes truly returned?"

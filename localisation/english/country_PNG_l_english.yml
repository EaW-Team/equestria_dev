 PNG_king_charlton: "Charlton"
 PNG_king_charlton_desc: "Charlton hatched during an age of peace and prosperity. His family was a dynasty of military officers, and his grandmother had fought in the brutal wars against the griffon colonists. As such, Charlton's father made sure to raise him as a true patriot who would never trust a griffon, and who would never forgive them for what they had done to his grandma.\n\nWhen he grew up, he had no plans besides to follow in his ancestors' footsteps and join the army when he was older. This changed after the events of 978, which caused a domino effect that first collapsed the Nova Griffonian economy and then the penguin one. Being a young adult during the Decade of Poverty was difficult, but it gave him newfound purpose. With the help of his connections with the military, he joined a political movement advocating for the severing of relations with the griffons. What followed was a meteoric rise in fame, as his scathing writings condeming the rule of Queen Edith were published in newspapers, printed on pamphlets and spread across the Kingdom. The popularity even resulted in him getting married.\n\nWhen Edith died in 989, the Council of Elders was strongly lobbied by the military to elect the firebrand Charlton as King, believing they could also control him. He immediately went to work, reverting many policies of the previous ruler. This started the famed Decade of Recovery. But not all was well for Charlton. His wife divorced him, leaving him to take care of his son Edgar alone after he hatched in 993. Afterwards he delegated his responsibilities to his advisors (who were often military officers) as he focused on raising his son instead.\n\nIt was during this difficult period in his life that Charlton was introduced to radical politics from a series of books that advocated for the revival of the spirit of the penguin race and the reclamation of land lost to griffons. Inspired by this, he once again returned to active politics in the new millenium, starting a rearmament program and funding confidential thaumaturgical research projects. His radicalism surprised even the military. This came at a cost, however, as he had to neglect his son more and more. This may have consequences that he might not be prepared for."
 
 # National spirits/ideas
 PNG_communist_agitators: "Communist Agitators"
 PNG_communist_agitators_desc: "Economic mobilization and conscription have made many working-class penguins rather upset. Communist agitators, likely funded by Stalliongrad, have capitalized on this opportunity, spreading vile propaganda and riling up the commoners."
 PNG_rearmament_program: "National Rearmament Program"
 PNG_rearmament_program_desc: "Already launched in 995 ALB by King Charlton's military advisors, the National Rearmament Program has been greatly expanded in recent years. The NRP aims to increase the size of the penguin military, to "safeguard the realm against foreign threats", primarily by mobilizing the economy and pouring funds into jingoistic propaganda."
 PNG_treaty_of_boreasfjord: "The Treaty of Boreasfjord"
 PNG_treaty_of_boreasfjord_desc: "Signed in 914 ALB by Queen Edith, the Treaty of Boreasfjord acknowledged the region of the Frozen North as lawful Nova Griffonian territory, granted the griffons full fishing rights in penguin waters, and removed all barriers on trade and investments between the two countries. While this ensured peace between the two nations and stimulated rapid industrialization and economic growth, the economic troubles of Nova Griffonia following the collapse of the Griffonian Empire in 978 ALB have made the treaty rather unpopular among the populace. King Charlton has actively tried to work around the treaty, but for now it remains in effect."

 PNG_galtung_state_desc:0 "When peace was made between penguins and polar bears in 312 ALB, Clan Galtung swore an oath of eternal loyalty to the Queen of the Penguins.

The clan is convinced that the cryomantic abilities of the penguins is proof of their divinity, and thus have no desire for independence, as long as they continue to be treated fairly."
 
 # Events
 penguin.1.t: "Project WINDIGO Annual Review"
 penguin.1.d: ""Attention!" shouted the penguin guard, standing like a formidable pillar with a rifle resting on her shoulder. "The King is coming."\n   All the penguins inside the laboratory stared at the guard in shock. Then, in an instant, they exploded into motion, cleaning the tables and the floor, putting the chairs back in place and straightening their lab coats. But before they could finish, the guard at the door stepped aside, and King Charlton appeared.\n   He smiled as the penguins inside stared at him, frozen in place. "Happy hearth's warming, everypenguin!" he exclaimed in a humorous tone.\n   There was a collective sigh of relief as the penguins relaxed. One of them, wearing round thick glasses that completely obscured his eyes, hurried to him. "Oh your highness, we didn't expect you so soon! You didn't specify your time of arrival in your message earlier, and we were right in the middle of—"\n   Charlton raised his flipper. "Yes, Gary, I wanted to surprise you all." Then he chuckled. "Seems I succeeded."\n   The scientist sighed. "I am glad you're in a good mood today, your highness. I hope this review doesn't dampen it."\n   Charlton frowned. "What, do you have bad news to share? Exactly one year ago, it seemed you were making great progress!"\n   "Yes, we were, but the field demonstration isn't ready for today, I am afraid..."\n   "Hrm." The King nodded, his frown deepening. "When do you think it will be?"\n   "We'll try to get it ready within one moon! Promise!"\n   Charlton's eyes drifted away as he rubbed his chin with his flipper. "Should not be too bad then, if you truly believe you can get everything ready five moons after that."\n   Gary gulped. "Yes, we'll do our best, working around the clock if needed!"\n   "Remember, if you need any extra resources, simply send a request and I shall approve it. I want the project to remain on schedule."\n   The scientist nodded almost frantically. "Yes, I know, I know. Sorry we couldn't get the demonstration ready for today. I'm aware it's an important date, the four-year anniversary of the project's start date, but we simply couldn't get the machine to meet our high standards."\n   "It is fine, Gary. The date is merely a symbolic one. Back then, I figured that the pony holiday celebrating the banishment of the Windigoes was appropriate, considering the name of the project. Now, how about we proceed with the annual review?""
 penguin.1.a: ""Yes, your highness.""

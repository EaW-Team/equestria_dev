 PNG_king_charlton: "Charlton"
 PNG_king_charlton_desc: "Charlton hatched during an age of peace and prosperity. However, his family was a dynasty of military officers, and his grandmother had fought in the brutal wars against the griffon colonists. As such, Charlton's father made sure to raise him as a true patriot who would never trust a griffon, and who would never forgive them for what they had done to his grandma.\n\nWhen he grew up, he had no plans besides to follow in his ancestors' footsteps and join the army when he was older. This changed after the events of 978, which caused a domino effect that first collapsed the Nova Griffonian economy and then the penguin one. Being a young adult during the Decade of Poverty was difficult, but it gave him newfound purpose. With the help of his connections with the military, he joined a political movement advocating for the severing of relations with the griffons. What followed was a meteoric rise in fame, as his scathing writings condeming the rule of Queen Edith were published in newspapers, printed on pamphlets and spread across the Kingdom. The popularity even resulted in him getting married.\n\nWhen Edith died in 989, the Council of Elders was strongly lobbied by the military to elect the firebrand Charlton as King. He immediately went to work, reverting many policies of the previous ruler. This started the famed Decade of Recovery. But not all was well for Charlton. His wife divorced him, leaving him to take care of his son Edgar alone after he hatched in 993. This made Charlton leave much of ruling to his advisors as he focused on raising his son instead.\n\nIt was during this difficult period in his life that Charlton was introduced to radical politics from a series of books that advocated for the revival of the spirit of the penguin race and the reclamation of land lost to griffons. Inspired by this, he once again returned to active politics, starting a rearmament program and funding confidential thaumaturgical research projects. This came at a cost, as he had to neglect his son more and more. This may have consequences that he might not be prepared for."
 #Charlton hatched during an age of peace and prosperity. If he had been the scion of some other family, perhaps he would've grown up to be a peaceful and tolerant person. However, his family was a dynasty of military officers, and his grandmother had fought in the brutal wars against the griffon colonists. As such, Charlton's father made sure to raise him as a true patriot who would never trust a griffon, and who would never forgive them for what they had done to his grandma.\n\nWhen he grew up, he had no plans besides to follow in his ancestors' footsteps and join the army when he was older.

 # National spirits/ideas
 PNG_communist_agitators: "Communist Agitators"
 PNG_communist_agitators_desc: "Economic mobilization and conscription have made many working-class penguins rather upset. Communist agitators, likely funded by Stalliongrad, have capitalized on this opportunity, spreading vile propaganda and riling up the commoners."
 PNG_rearmament_program: "National Rearmament Program"
 PNG_rearmament_program_desc: "Launched in 1004 ALB by King Charlton, the National Rearmament Program aims to greatly expand the size of the penguin military, to "safeguard the realm against foreign threats"."
 PNG_treaty_of_boreasfjord: "The Treaty of Boreasfjord"
 PNG_treaty_of_boreasfjord_desc: "Signed in 914 ALB by Queen Edith, the Treaty of Boreasfjord acknowledged the region of the Frozen North as lawful Nova Griffonian territory, granted the griffons full fishing rights in penguin waters, and removed all barriers on trade and investments between the two countries. While this ensured peace between the two nations and stimulated rapid industrialization and economic growth, the economic troubles of Nova Griffonia following the collapse of the Griffonian Empire in 978 ALB have made the treaty rather unpopular among the populace. King Charlton has actively tried to work around the treaty, but for now it remains in effect."

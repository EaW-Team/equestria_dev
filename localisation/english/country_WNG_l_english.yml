 WNG_garibald_talonuel_iii:0 "Garibald Talonuel III"
 WNG_garibald_talonuel_iii_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th November 940, Karthin, Wingbardy.\n\n§YBiography§!: Known as the 'Soldier King' due to his leadership during the Falcor War, Garibald Talonuel di Almieri is well respected and beloved by the Wingbardian griffons. In 972 ALB his father, King Gumberto, was murdered in the Imperial Palace in Griffenheim while attending a party for the young Grover V. The newly crowned Garibald demanded justice but was given none. In protest he severed all ties with the Empire, declaring Wingbardy to be independent for the first time in over a century. The rest of the empire soon took Wingbardy's lead, quickly leading to the Empire's collapse.\n\nThe first few years of independence was prosperous for Wingbardy, however a border dispute with Falcor in 985 lead to four long and bloody years of conflict that scarred Wingbardy to this day. During the war, King Garibald Talonuel III was known to often visit the frontline and had significant support among his troops.\n\nHowever, the years since the war have only seen Wingbardy's situation grown worse. Failed government after failed government, along with a crippled economy, has lead to many Wingbardians demanding that he step in and find a way to resolve their situation. With the rise of Fascism and Communism, it became clear that only he could decide Wingbardy's future.\n\nHe sees his son, Gumberto, as a disappointment and secretly fears for the future of the monarchy unless his son can better himself. In the King's free time he is an avid stamp collector. His collection of postal stamps is the largest in the world.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Sinister"
 WNG_gumberto_ii:0 "Gumberto II"
 WNG_political_deadlock:0 "Political Deadlock"
 WNG_political_deadlock_desc:0 "The Falcor War left the nation in a state of chaos. What was supposed to be a triumph quickly turned into a farce. So much Wingbardian blood was shed for only a few miles of Falcorian land and a single city devastated by the war. With the collapsing economy and the growing distrust of successive failed governments, the Wingbardian political system is in shatters and few see how it can survive without reform or revolution."
 WNG_political_deadlock_tt:0 "§RThis national spirit will only be removed if a party or coalition rules with a majority of seats in the Chamber of Deputies.§!"
 WNG_economic_crisis:0 "Economic Crisis"
 WNG_economic_crisis_desc:0 "Wingbardy experienced rapid industrial growth during the last few years of the Empire. However, the collapse of the Empire and the long, bloody war with Falcor has left the nation in catastrophic economic decline.\nNow there is rampant unemployment.

 WNG_outdated_army:0 "Outdated Army"
 WNG_outdated_army_desc:0 "Since our triumph in the long, brutal years of the Falcor war, it has become apparent that our pride in victory has come with some downsides. Our military is still rooted in the tactics that won us the city of Falcor and has been reluctant to innovate using new modern methods. We will need to fix this if we are to face any threats to our nation's survival."

The new republic cannot allow a parallel authority to exist, but previous attempts of law enforcement to crack down on the mafia have always floundered.

 WNG_fix_the_resource_deficit_desc:0 "It is not that Wingbardy lacks resources, it is that too much of it is wasted, whether on frivolous civilian projects or on exports to unworthy foreigners.

 WNG_develop_our_island:0 "Develop Purrsia"
 WNG_develop_our_island_desc:0 "To say Purrsia is not the most developed part of our nation would be an understatement.

 WNG_colonial_troops:0 "Colonial Troops"
 WNG_colonial_troops_desc:0 "It is expensive and unpopular to send soldiers overseas, away from their families and homes.

 WNG_limited_self_rule_desc:0 "It is inefficient and undesirable to completely control the overseas territories from Karthin.

Ever since the murder of his father in 971, Garibald Talonuel has led Wingbardy through times of both triumph and hardship. He was instrumental in the collapse of the Griffonian Empire, protected the south from Imperial aggression and united the nation through the long and bloody war with Falcor. Garibald Talonuel was also a prolific stamp collector with over 100,000 stamps in his private collection, each of them personally documented and studied. He left his collection to the National Karthinian Museum for all Wingbardians to enjoy.\n\nThe throne now passes to his son Prince Gumberto, who is a mere shadow of his father.

La Marcia Reale d'Ordinanza has been the national anthem for close to 100 years, but ever since Beakolini and his Fascist took power their own anthem, Giovinezza, has (often forcefully) supplanted it. Those loyal to the King see this as a great betrayal of Wingbardian tradition, but the King has remained silent on the issue. There is now a debate in parliament on whether la Marcia Reale d'Ordinanza should be officially replaced by Giovinezza as the official national anthem of the nation.\n\nIt is expected to go the Blackwing's way, after all, la Marcia Reale d'Ordinanza has no official lyrics while Giovinezza has such wonderful verses as \"With a Wingbardian's pride swear fealty to Beakolini\". This mandatory anthem is merely the griffons showing how much they love Il Duce. \n\nUnlike his father, Prince Gumberto has not remained silent on the issue. He has instead proposed La Leggenda del Piumave as a compromise. The popular song dates to the Falcor War and tales of the flooding of the river Piumave, halting Falcor's invasion of Wingbardy shortly after the disastrous battle at Clawporetto and how it allowed the Regio Esercito time to launch the counter attack required to push Falcor back and to final victory at the battle of Garibald Gergamo.\n\nWith the debate being held, who will carry the day?"

 wingbardy.9.t:0 "The Fascists Seize Karthin"
 wingbardy.9.d:0 "The crisis that has been consuming Wingbardy over the past few months has finally boiled over, as Giulio Beakolini marched into Karthin alongside his blackwing paramilitary supporters. Just a few hours before, Beakolini had made a simple announcement regarding the PNF's political program. They would rule Wingbardy by the end of the day, no matter the cost. \n\nAnd the cost would be steep indeed, as Karthin's inhabitants would come to find out over the next few hours. The blackwings moved quickly to secure control over the city's police stations, railways, and other institutions. Arrayed against them were the city's police forces and various anti-fascist paramilitary groups that had risen to resist the blackwings.\n\nGunfire echoed through the streets as the cities defenders hurriedly set up barricades. The offices of liberal newspapers and political parties were looted and burnt to the ground. Critics of the PNF were tracked down and punished. Parliament itself was invaded and occupied by the blackwings after a short battle. The only building that remained untouched was the royal palace, but this was cold comfort to the city's ordinary inhabitants.\n\nAs night fell, the burning buildings stood out like torches, providing ample illumination for the citizens to appreciate how far the eternal city had fallen. Shortly after, relief finally came to the city's beleaguered residents, as King Talonuel invited Beakolini to form a government over the radio. The new fascist government seems intent on stabilizing the situation, but much damage has been done."
 wingbardy.9.a:0 "At least it's over..."

 wingbardy.10.t:0 "The Meeting"
 wingbardy.10.d:0 "When Giulio Beakolini declared that his blackwings would march on Karthin unless he were installed as prime minister, he was in effect making a calculated gamble. Assuming that the relationship between the King and Prime Minister Ventriglio's government was deteriorating and by adding a little pressure to the mix, he could sever it completely.\n\nThis proved to be an astute observation. The King's unwillingness to declare martial law has led to the resignation of Prime Minister Ventriglio and the collapse of the PLW's government. The King was unwilling to work with the communists. The PLW was out of power for the foreseeable future. This state of affairs left Beakolini and his PNF as the last griffons standing.\n\nA triumphant Beakolini entered the Royal Palace this morning, invited by the King to form a new government. However, the participants in his march looked somewhat embarrassed to have their thunder stolen from them. While nothing is set in stone yet, it seems unlikely that anything will derail Beakolini's ascent to power at the last moment. "
 wingbardy.10.a:0 "Let's hope this goes smoothly."

 wingbardy.11.t:0 "Martial Law"
 wingbardy.11.d:0 "With Beakolini and his Blackwings on the edge of carrying out their march against Karthin, Prime Minister Gallo Ventriglio met one last time with King Garibald Talonuel III to once more attempt to convince him to sign a decree of martial law. The King had already refused multiple times before, stating that he doubted the ability of the army to contain the Blackwings without setting off a civil war, despite the generals and cabinet all stating otherwise. However, now the situation was at a breaking point, with it being clear that should this last attempt fail, Ventriglio would resign and the government would fall.\n\nPerhaps it was for that reason that the King changed his mind. Or maybe it was because he was finally convinced that martial law would prove no danger to Wingbardy itself. But for whatever reason, Garibald Talonuel III finally agreed to sign the declaration of martial law in the country, and put down the Blackwing revolt by force. That very same week, the army routed the fascists without difficulty, as they heavily outnumbered the Blackwings. With minimal damage, the threat to the government was over.\n\nThe troubles are not over, though, as political deadlock in the parliament remains. The PLW's coalition has fallen apart, and they no longer have the strength to push forward anything to rectify the country's situation. Ventriglio's government will not last much longer, and change must come to Wingbardy's politics if it is to survive. How that change will happen is not yet certain, however."
 wingbardy.11.a:0 "Let's hope the future goes smoothly."
 
 wingbardy.12.t:0 "Wingbardy Proposes a Treaty"
 wingbardy.12.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events, representatives sent by Giulio Beakolini—architect of the fascist ideology—have come to Stalliongrad on a diplomatic mission. Although Mr. Beakolini has only recently taken his position within the Wingbardian state, he has already abandoned the previous government's hostile attitude towards our nation.\n\nThe representatives are proposing a Wingbardian-Stalliongrad treaty of friendship and an economic and trade deal which would support our industrialisation goals. In addition, they offer to recognise us as the de jure government of our territory and establish full diplomatic relations with us. Although this deal seems quite favourable, many Stalliongradians question Beakolini's motives. No doubt the griffon has his own agenda, and sees us as little more than tools for advancing Wingbardian interests."
 wingbardy.12.a:0 "We shall accept this proposal."
 wingbardy.12.b:0 "Fascism is antithetical to everything we stand for! "

 wingbardy.13.a:0 "Excellent."

 wingbardy.14.t:0 "Stalliongrad Declines"
 wingbardy.14.d:0 "Bad news, as our representatives return from Stalliongrad having failed to secure their cooperation for our proposed treaty of friendship. Despite continuous advances, the Stalliongradian government proved both hostile and intractable, killing any chance for a mutually beneficial relationship between our nations. This is highly unfortunate, as they would have proved a valuable check on Equestrian intentions."

 wingbardy.15.d:0 "For years, Wingbardy has viewed the prospect of a resurgent Griffonian Empire as the gravest threat to the stability of our entire continent, and under the leadership of [FROM.GetLeader], they seem willing to take bold action to forestall this possibility, including working with us. Our sources within the Wingbardian government indicate that they wish for a détente between our two nations.\n\nCritically, Wingbardian representatives have contacted us with a proposal to contain the threat by jointly preventing Imperial expansion. They have invited us to Chiazbeacle to meet about creating a united front against the Griffonian Empire, asking that we move beyond our past territorial struggles and sign a pact of non-aggression, in addition to both guaranteeing the independence of Griffonstone."

In light of this, it seems we will have to look elsewhere for partners to aid us against our enemies."

 wingbardy.18.t:0 "The Tarrin Conference"
 wingbardy.18.d:0 "Ever since the first Aquileian revolution, the region of Tarrin has proven to be a major point of contention between Aquileia and Francistria. The area was seized by Count Francis VIII after a republican uprising which had overthrown the local Discret Countess. After the monarchist restoration, Francistrian army refused to vacate the territory as Francis VIII asserted his dynastic claim to Tarrin. Weakened by revolution, Aquileia did not dare to get into a conflict with the Karthinian Pact.\n\nNow, dignitaries from all parties involved are gathering to resolve the tensions, so the diplomatic relations between Aquileia, Francistria and Wingbardy can be normalized. Pleasing all three will be extremely difficult, and many are sceptical about the upcoming conference. But there is some hope that peace between the two major powers of southern Griffonia can be secured for the foreseeable future."
 wingbardy.18.a:0 "Let us pray it goes well."

 wingbardy.20.t:0 "The Conference Commences"
 wingbardy.20.d:0 "Diplomats from Aquileia, Wingbardy and Francistria have gathered in Eaglers today to conduct negotiations about the contested status of Tarrin. Already the negotiations have been tense, as Aquileians demanded the return of their rightful territory while Francistria asserted its own claims. Wingbardy was in the best role to act as a mediator between the two parties, as it had little interest in the disputed region.\n\nAquileian representatives said that the claim of late Count Francis VIII was illegitimate as Count Francis I had been a bastard of the Discret dynasty. Francistrians countered this by saying that the land compensated the losses Count Francis VIII had suffered while toppling the lawless Republic of Tarrin. In addition, they highlighted the similarities between Tarrinian and Francistrian cultures, and pointed out that over the decades thousands of colonists had settled the area. Aquileians countered by saying cultural similarities hardly justified military conquest and that the colonists were living on property seized from the locals.\n\nThis back and forth continued with no end in sight. Wingbardian delegates needed to intervene and propose a solution that would end the pointless squabbling. However, would they try to please either side, or try to come up with a compromise that might leave both sides unhappy?"
 wingbardy.20.a:0 "All of Tarrin belongs to Aquileia."
 wingbardy.20.b:0 "We can draw new borders based on the current populations."
 wingbardy.20.c:0 "We shall work out a form of compensation instead of land."

 wingbardy.21.t:0 "Wingbardy Offers All Of Tarrin"
 wingbardy.21.d:0 "During the tense diplomatic meetings held in Eaglers during the Tarrin Conference, the Wingbardian dignitaries approached Aquileian ones in private and made an intriguing offer. As Wingbardy did not care much for the disputed territory, they were willing to offer it in behalf of Francistria. This meant the Wingbardian army would not intervene and allow Aquileians to occupy Tarrin fully.\n\nOf course, this was an irresistible offer for the Aquileian diplomats, who happily agreed to it. However, Francistrians may yet protest this proposal, so the outcome of the conference remains uncertain for now."

A new border would be drawn between the two nations, splitting the region roughly evenly and following ethnic boundaries. The initial map presented seemed rather... unappealing, but a more refined version with less irregular borders proved to be more satisfactory.\n\nThe Aquileian dignitaries were hesitant however. It was a half-hearted solution, and would mean splitting the region for many years to come. Perhaps tensions would simply reappear later? The diplomats had a difficult choice to make."

They offered monetary compensation for the loss of Tarrin, covering the costs of the Francistrian occupation over the last thirty years or so.\n\nWhile it was a hefty sum, it also meant Wingbardy would continue to support Francistria and allow it to continue its unlawful occupation of Aquileian territory. While money is good to have, getting it would not liberate Tarrin. However, Tarrin might be a sacrifice Aquileia must be willing to make to secure an alliance with the mighty Kingdom of Wingbardy."

They offered to secure the transfer of Tarrin to Aquileia, securing good relations between Aquileia and Wingbardy, but apparently completely neglecting Francistrian interests in the process. Considering Francistria has been Wingbardy's ally for years and fought alongside them in the Falcor War, this act is tantamount to spitting on the graves of Francistrian soldiers who gave up their lives in Wingbardy's war.\n\nClearly, Francistrian delegates must protest this. But the unfortunate truth is that they have little leverage over the two major powers. Most they can do is threaten to leave the [WNG.GetFactionName], but this would simply allow Aquileia to seize Tarrin by force. Perhaps accepting the loss of Tarrin is the only way to guarantee peace..."

They offered monetary compensation for the loss of Tarrin, covering the costs of the Francistrian occupation over the last thirty years or so.\n\nThis was proof to Francistrian delegates that Wingbardy was still ready to support its old allies instead of simply bowing before Aquileian posturing. The reparations were unlikely to please Aquileia, but the fact that Wingbardy was offering to pay it out of their own pockets impressed Francistrians. Clearly, Wingbardy was doing everything it could to show to the world that they had not forgotten everything Francistria had done for them."

The Aquileians soon lost interest in the conference and have seemingly decided to withdraw from it entirely, seeing it as a useless way to resolve the Tarrin dispute. This made the Francistrian delegates rather pleased, although somewhat worried that Aquileians would pursue a more... violent solution to the issue.\n\nThe Tarrin Conference has failed, and tensions between Aquileia and Francistria will continue to be a thorn on the side of Wingbardy for the foreseeable future."

 wingbardy.30.d:0 "When the Francistrian delegation was informed of the deal that had been made between Aquileian and Wingbardian representatives, they responded with a mixture of disappointment and outrage. The fact that Wingbardy had separately negotiated with Aquileian diplomats without Francistrians was insulting to them, and they did not like the proposed treaty either. They thought it was a poor attempt at appeasing Aquileians while completely neglecting Francistrian interests.\n\nWorst of all, the Francistrian delegates threatened that their nation would withdraw from the [WNG.GetFactionName] rather than cede any part of Tarrin to Aquileia. This was a way to make a statement that Wingbardy could not decide the fate of Tarrin without Francistria's involvement.\n\nThe Wingbardian diplomats were now faced with a difficult situation. Would they recognize Aquileia's claims to the region, or stand by their long-time ally and withdraw from the negotiations entirely? Either way, the Tarrin Conference had failed. The dispute was now unlikely to be resolved peacefully."

The Wingbardian delegates were hesitant, and as a result Francistria has formally announced that it has left the alliance. Their diplomats immediately left the conference, bringing it to an abrupt ending.\n\nThis dramatic turn of events means that resolving the Tarrin dispute peacefully has failed. However, thanks to Wingbardy's support, Aquileia's claims to the regions are recognized, and an attack on Francistria might be justified. Now that Francistria is left without their powerful ally, they should be unable to resist the Aquileian military.

The golden light glowed in the many windows like the sun rising on a hall of mirrors. He could still hear the laughs from the decadent Griffenheim elite, but the party was anything but jovial. There was a pressure in the air. Like a string under tension on the verge of snapping. Surely everyone but the 12-year old Emperor could feel it.\n\nKing Gumberto of Wingbardy had kept a civil face throughout the whole ordeal and when Emperor Grover V had drifted asleep on his throne, he had taken his leave. \"Meet me outside in fifteen minutes,\" the king said to Garibald. Now Garibald peered out into the dim light of the courtyard. It wasn't long until a pair of griffons came into sight, even in the darkness he could make out his father's shape. He headed towards them. The pair of griffons argued in hushed voices. Suddenly there was the flash of a knife and a half-scream choked out of existence as it left his father's throat.\n\nGaribald held his father in his arms, not caring for the blood that soiled his robes. There was so much of it. He screamed for help, but his father took his claw. The king tried to say something but all that came out was one last choke before he went limp.\n\nThe nobles came one by one and gathered around them like a wake of vultures. Even the young emperor still holding his doll and rubbing the sleep from his eyes – The Duke of Strawberry made sure he had a front row seat.\n\nGaribald awoke, not with a start, but with a pained tiredness. The early light of dawn lazily flowed through his windows. He glanced at the photograph by his bed of his wife and young son before slowly rising to his feet. He stepped out onto his villa's balcony and stared out across the olive trees and vineyards. His father's killer was still out there, somewhere. All these years later he was no closer to the truth.

By granting the most popular party a majority reforms needed to improve the economic and welfare situation of the common Wingbardian can be forced through without the standard opposition and petty infighting that has caused the dire situation the country had found itself in.\n\nOpponents of the law however see this as nothing short of a power-grab by Beakolini and the PNF and proof that Beakolini is not at all interested in bipartisan politics or compromise. However, there are murmurings in the chamber that Beakolini does have a point and the current political situation is unfixable without a radical solution.\n\nRegardless the PNF will have a lot of work to do to ensure that the majority of Deputies will vote in favour of the law."

The results in some states were seriously questioned due to rumors of voter intimidation, electoral fraud and other such acts by Blackwing members, but nevertheless they have now been generally accepted and the PNF given their rightful seats as mandated by the Gacerbo Law.

His word and opinion was valued by many, from the common griffon his everyday issues to politicians on gaining the support of the religious. It was for that reason that Beakolini had arranged a private meeting at the Prelatine. The PPW is a strongly religious party and many of its members have sworn to resist any attempt by Beakolini to seize power, but by gaining the blessing of the Prelate their opposition would suddenly become a crisis of faith and the integrity of the party would shatter.\n\nUnfortunately, Beakolini would not be able to use many of his normal tactics here. The Prelate was a faithful and holy griffon and trying to intimidate or bribe him would only end in disaster. Some said that the gods gave him the ability to see through lies as well. So the only thing he could do was to speak with him, be honest about his intentions, and hope that they would give him their blessing.\n\nThe meeting was held at the High Temple of Boreas. As they walked the temple grounds Beakolini gave a passionate speech about his worries for the nation and his desire to help the common Griffon. At the end of the visit, they had coffee on a balcony and the Prelate granted Beakolini his blessing. A public statement was released a few hours later and immediately it had the effect Beakolini desired. Griffons across all layers of society reconsidered their stance on the PNF, giving us some much-needed votes."

 wingbardy.44.t:0 "Giacomo Gatteotti Speaks Out Against Fascism"
 wingbardy.44.d:0 "Trouble against the PNF has risen in the parliament once again, as Giacomo Gatteotti, leader of the PSU party has made yet another speech denouncing both Beakolini's leadership and fascism as a whole in Wingbardy. Having long been the head of the Partito Socialista Unitario, he has ardently stood against the new Prime Minister since his first day in office, constantly pushing for the griffons of parliament to unite against him and the PNF. It seems that a large part of our opposition agreed with his rousing moment, and the griffon is proving to be a real thorn in our side. Beakolini has already expressed his displeasure at the constant attempts to undermine him."

 wingbardy.45.t:0 "Giacomo Gatteotti Disappears"
 wingbardy.45.d:0 "Shocking news has spread across Wingbardy as of late, for Giacomo Gatteotti, head of the PSU has mysteriously disappeared. While his whereabouts are unknown at the moment, witnesses say that they saw the socialist leader being bundled into a car by masked attackers. The search for him continues, yet many are already fearing that it is too late. It seems that the blame for the attack is being put mostly onto the local Blackwings, which have long had a violent history with such incidents. Both the local police and PSU members have cooperated in locating the missing politician."
 wingbardy.45.a:0 "This isn't what I meant!"

 wingbardy.46.t:0 "Giacomo Gatteotti's Body Found"
 wingbardy.46.d:0 "The worst fears of many came true a few days ago, as the body of Giacomo Gatteotti was finally found, hidden deep in the Warthog Jungle. A later autopsy by medical experts found that he had been stabbed no less than seven times by his assailants. Many in the PSU and beyond are in mourning, as Giacomo was a generally well-liked figure among the liberals and socialists for his moderate policies. While the party itself has fractured some and brought more into the PNF, the vast majority are already directing their anger at the government for letting this happen, as well as fanning the suspicion of Blackwing involvement."
 wingbardy.46.a:0 "I swear, I had nothing to do with this!"

 wingbardy.47.t:0 "Fascists Arrested over Gatteotti's Murder"
 wingbardy.47.d:0 "The griffons behind the murder of Giacomo Gatteotti have finally been caught, as the police have apprehended five individuals who were in relation to the crime. The evidence against them at this point is overwhelming, and many legal experts are already guaranteeing it to be an open-and-shut case. In a turn to the worse for the PNF and Beakolini, though, one of the alleged murderers is known and prominent Blackwing officer. Rumors are already spreading of Beakolini's possible involvement of the murder due to Gatteotti's known opposition to his government.\n\nTwo options have been put forward by our officials. The first is to save face and let the trial go ahead. While it would undoubtedly hurt the reputation and popularity of the PNF as a whole, Beakolini's innocence in the case would be proved and the government itself could get off scotch-free. The other option is to use our connections to get them off the hook. Our party wouldn't take the hit that an actual conviction could bring, but it would only increase suspicions of Beakolini's involvement and erode trust in the government."
 wingbardy.47.a:0 "Beakolini is innocent. The trial should go ahead."
 wingbardy.47.b:0 "Pull strings to get them off without charge."

 wingbardy.48.t:0 "A New Plan"
 wingbardy.48.d:0 "The failure of the Gacerbo Law to pass have been a devastating blow to our efforts in Wingbardy. Without it, the parliament will continue to delay and hinder Beakolini in pushing forward his plans. Now that our motion to achieve full dominance in Wingbardian politics has failed, it is clear that our only option left is to take much more drastic measures.\n\nPlans are already being drawn up for a coup of the current government. Though it is unfortunate, acting against the king and those that oppose Beakolini is not only necessary to advance our interests, it is necessary for the future of Wingbardy itself. The Blackwings, the PNF and the rest of those loyal to fascism are already preparing for what must be done."

 wingbardy.49.d:0 "With their recent diplomatic overtures a success, the Wingbardians have again approached us with a new proposal for further cooperation, this time being a joint event between our two militaries. They seem eager to learn of our experiences in tank warfare, and the Wingbardian general staff has already offered to share their knowledge of more general griffon warfare from their training and the Falcor War. Though it is certain that we could benefit from this in planning and tactics, if the fascists ever betray us later they will have benefited as much as we have."

The anti-fascist forces, made up mostly of republicans, socialists and communists have banded together under one banner, led by a "National Liberation Committee". The committee consists of Antonino Proletarino with the PCW, Giovanni Gacci of the PSW, and Giovanni De Gaspwingi of the PPW, bringing together a wide coalition of parties centered in Wrobert.\n\nMeanwhile around Falcor and Asbolus, Beakolini has received the blessing of King Talonuel to end the war, and now leads his Blackwings along with the rest of the royal army to put down the revolution. Fighting has already broken out all across the nation, as both sides seem willing to fight to the bitter end. Who will achieve victory though, is not yet certain."

The few remaining fascists have surrendered this morning as the flags of freedom wave above the cities of Wingbardy and the common griffons celebrate the return of peace. \n\nHowever, with the fascists and reactionaries out of the picture the NLC is starting to turn on itself. Socialists, communists, and republicans who were once allies in the revolution are dividing themselves and seeking to secure power for their own side. As the war ends, the future of Wingbardy remains uncertain."

 wingbardy.52.t:0 "The Coup"
 wingbardy.52.d:0 "Chaos temporarily gripped Karthin today as the PNF and the Blackwings have forcibly seized control of the government, taking complete control over the parliament. The Chamber of Deputies was almost immediately secured with the various ministers rounded up, and the King's Palace was locked down. All across the nation, local governments either complied with the new leaders or were forced to at gunpoint, ensuring that there was no possible pushback. As soon as Wingbardy was confirmed secure, Beakolini announced a state of emergency due to recent events and instated martial law across the entire nation. Though he assured Wingbardians that this was only temporary, there was also not a set time or date when it would be lifted.\n\nWhile our mission to secure our control was a success, and now we are unopposed in going forward with our goals, there is still one last issue to address. King Garibald Talonuel III, the ruler of Wingbardy is still inside his palace, guarded by our most loyal Blackwings. This would be a rare opportunity to dispose of the king if we so wish, as he no longer wields any real power. With the current situation, not many griffons would be able to object. However, the king is still beloved by many of his people, and the soldiers of Wingbardy. Allowing him to remain, even if only as a puppet, may be more beneficial to Beakolini and the country as a whole."

However, most of our general staff are confident that the Wingbardians will be in no position to strike back during their civil war. In addition, we can prepare our defences in Katren should Wingbardy look to retake it after their civil war.\n\nSome argue that even if we have time to fortify ourselves, we will still be disadvantaged should the Wingbardians return in force. All reports do indicate that the Wingbardian army outclasses our own, even if it were to be diminished by civil war.\n\nRegardless of our decision, our commanders and diplomats are awaiting orders."

With all of our forces back home, there was little that our remaining colonial troops could do against the oncoming Abyssinian forces.\n\nMany refugees escaped to the island of Purrsia. Despite fears of an imminent invasion of Purrsia, the local governor is adamant that the Abyssinians are in no position to attack, and our ambassador in Abyssinia agrees. Our remaining colony is safe for now.\n\nSome among the administration are furious at this stab in the back and firmly believe in striking back against Abyssinia once the civil war is resolved. Many others, however, are not convinced that we should even be in Zebrica. They point out the hypocrisy of investing abroad while our people back home are suffering and are in desperate need of help, and insist that Wingbardy should leave the matter of Katren be.\n\nWe can cut down the latter position to abandon our expanding ambitions in Zebrica while remaining in Purrsia without angering the warhawks. However, we risk appearing weak to the people if we leave this besmirchment of our national pride unanswered. We might perhaps be able to bring the revolution to the Abyssinians while gaining back our land."

Both sides have finally put a decisive end to the long-lasting Tarrin conflict, and ever since our relations have only gotten better. After signing a defence pact, it would only be logical to go further and sign an official alliance between our blocs, so we can unite our forces against common enemies.\n\nOn the other claw, it might be better to bide our time, as the situation in the region can drastically change in the matter of days or weeks.

It seemed some griffon had other plans for him tonight, though. Another knock, more incessant. \"Come in, I'm here.\" When the door opened, the socialist leader widened his eyes at the sight before him. Three armed griffons, barely adults, entered, along with Antonino Proletarino, the leader of the PCW. The latter put a stack of papers on Gacci's desk.\n\"Ah, mister Gacci, enjoying your rest?\"\n\"Cut to the chase Anton, and please put those guns downs, you will hurt somegriff.\" The three hesitated, slightly lowering their rifles.\n\"Thank you for your speech in the Chamber today, Giovanni, a few words from you and the liberals who opposed our cause fled Karthin!\"\n\nWas Anton really just starting another coup? \"Our cause, or yours? Look at you, reveling in the power of the gun. The power of the fasces!\" Giovanni stood up, causing three rifles to point at him, the barrels shaking from unsteady claws.\n\"I am no fascist!\" The communist slammed Gacci's desk. \"I will protect the revolution. I will not let you stop me! Now sign this.\"\nGacci read the papers. \"What is this... arrest warrants? A party fusion? No griffon is going to believe this! You are subverting the will of the people!\" Gacci's protests were met with silence. Giovanni slumped back down in his seat, looking up at the four faces staring at him. The griffon felt his heart pound in his chest. His desk drawer had his pistol in it, loaded. He did not expect the future of Wingbardian democracy to come down to his own personal bravery, but here he was. Gacci reached his claw down to his drawer..."

A few hours later he turned on the radio to hear an audibly confused radio host read the forged statements of his departure from politics and the end of the Wingbardian Socialist Party. The PCW was in charge now, but at least none of those kids would have had to see a body. At least he'd get to see the morning. Gacci stood up and walked out of his office, closing the door behind him. He sighed again, turning around and making his way home. Tomorrow the sun would shine again.

As Gacci had hoped, the three young griffons did not fire in the moment, although one had her talon on the trigger. The socialist managed to soften his voice as his colleague squirmed on the floor. \"What is your name, miss?\"\n\"Gianna...\" the other two stared in disbelief as she aimed her rifle determinedly. \"What is your job Gianna?\"\n\"I work at a Wrobert dockyard, mister Gacci.\" She stepped forward, her rifle aimed at the griffon's forehead.\n\"I see. Thank you for helping us. Without Wrobert, the revolution wouldn't have been possible.\"\n\"And you did nothing! The PCW always helped us dockers!\"\n\nGiovanni's eyes widened in fear, but he pressed on. \"Don't think about what I did, but about what I will do. If you lower your rifle, your fight will be over. If you shoot, who knows?\"\n\"I just...\" Her grip weakened.\n\"How about you all go home? You have done your part, now let me do mine.\" Gianna lowered her rifle hesitantly and Gacci managed a smile when the three young adults sat down on the floor.

"No. I won't sign those arrest papers, or that party merger, or anything else you put in front of me. You'll have to kill me." He looked deep into the eyes of each of the guards. His heart was beating hard, but he kept his face calm. "And if you kill me, you'll have another civil war on your claws. Is that what you want, Anton?"\n"I want you to comply peacefully. But if you won't..." Proletarino sighed. "Break his wings."\nOne of the guards slowly, uncertainly approached Gacci. "I'm sorry," she whispered.\n"I know you don't want to do this. None of you." Gacci bowed his head. "I know you all want communism. But this isn't the way to it."\n"Be quiet," Proletarino ordered. "Gianna, do it."\nGianna took a deep breath. "No, Anton. You are my comrade... but so is he. He may not be as devoted as us, but what you're talking about is how we treat the blackwings. Not socialists."\nProletarino narrowed his eyes. "Fine. Giorgia, you do what comrade Gianna is too weak for." But neither of the other two guards moved.\nGiovanni swept his claw across them. "Comrades... friends. I know the PSW and the PCW have not always seen eye to eye, but we are still fighting for the same thing. This kind of thuggishness is the tactic of Beakolini. Please, put your weapons down, and let's talk."\nOne by one, Anton's guards placed their guns on the ground. Anton's ears went flat; he knew he was beaten. "Will you kill him?" Giorgia asked, her voice heavy with fear.\n"No," Gacci answered. "He'll have to face trial for conspiracy, but I promise it'll be fair. And you can visit him in prison."\nAnton looked up, finally. "Why?" he asked. "Why not just kill me? It'd be a thorn out of your feathers.""

 wingbardy.79.d:0 "As battle lines coalesce along partisan loyalties, serious questions have arisen regarding the recruitment of soldiers. The hopes for a swathe of willing volunteers have been dashed, and our commanders are desperately calling for new recruits. The obvious solution to this deficit would be enforcing conscription, but there are possible issues.\n\nShould we call upon drafted Wingbardians, many of them might not be in line with our ideals and committed to our cause. This, of course, means that they are not as willing to fight on as our more ardent volunteers and possibly lead to future problems such as desertion or, worse, defection. There is also the matter of 'diluting' the cause with griffons who aren't already supporting us.\n\nHowever, realities on the ground make it clear that we will be at a severe disadvantage if we do not enact conscription. We may have to sacrifice somewhat on our ideals to carry the revolution through to victory."
 wingbardy.79.a:0 "We need every griffon we can get."
 wingbardy.79.b:0 "The revolution shall be voluntary."

 wingbardy.80.t:0 "Good Help"
 wingbardy.80.d:0 "The revolution is in full swing now, but domestic policies still require solving if we want to further our cause in the long run. We're forming our cabinet and, in turn, our government. It's become evident that there is a schism forming between the reformists and the radicals, and it would be in our best interest to placate at least one of these wings by inviting their influential members into our government. In this case, two candidates are available.\n\nGivanoe Wingomi is from the party's reformist wing and has long since been a strong, moderate voice in the party. He is a true believer in the cause and has pledged full support. However, Wingomi still believes that there is merit with some of the more outdated old system institutions that can be reformed in service to the revolution. Being a creature born from politics, Givanoe knows the inner workings of government and is well used to it, making him an obvious pick for an advisory position in our new state.\n\nAlternatively, the novelist Gennaro Bordiclaw is Wingomi's opposite in most respects. The more ardent and idealist among the party's radicals, Gennaro is known for his rhetoric pushing for greater freedoms and ideals in his writings. Were he to be appointed, not only would it appease the radicals, but Bordiclaw's writings may finally be applied and prove that we can go beyond. For the people and for the world.\n\nHowever, we may wish to forego appointing either one of these griffons to office. After all, giving power to one wing might rob us of our desired revolution."
 wingbardy.80.a:0 "Givanoe Wingomi will help keep stability."
 wingbardy.80.b:0 "Gennaro Bordiclaw is a true revolutionary!"

 wingbardy.81.t:0 "Gallus' Visit"
 wingbardy.81.d:0 "The moment Gallus stepped off the train car, he became filled with anxiety. It was late afternoon in Karthin, and already Gallus felt incredibly lost. Griffons all around him were speaking in Wingbardian and Francistrian dialects, which were complete gibberish to the Griffonstone raised chick.\n\n"Oh gods... what in the world do I do?" muttered Gallus to himself. He took flight above the station, looking around at the ancient city of Karthin. From the old districts to the modern ones, he was completely overwhelmed. It was an entirely different city than Griffonstone, more like Manehattan than his home. "Alright Gallus, you got this. That invitation from the Gaspwingi fella said to meet him at Parliament. Not sure where I'm supposed to go, or what it even looks like... but Twilight said she trusts me with this. And I can't disappoint my old professor."\n\nGallus began to fly about the city, trying to find anything that looked vaguely like a government building. Karthin was like a maze, and it was easy to get lost even while flying. Finally, he noticed a landmark he recognized from a history book. Some obelisk the Karthinians took a few hundred years ago from somewhere that now sat in front of their parliament building. Swooping down, Gallus found himself in front of a fairly inconspicuous building, but he trusted that this was what he was looking for.\n\n"Now, how do I find Mr. Gaspwingi..." Gallus looked around and saw a guard by a door on the side of the building. Deciding it was his best way in, he floated down to ground level and approached the guard.\n\n"Umm, hello sir! My name is Gallus, I'm from Griffonstone and I am here to see, uhh..." Gallus rummaged around in his bag before pulling out the letter, "Deputy Giovanni De Gaspwingi. He wanted me to meet with him, I think."\n\nThe guard cocked his head, "Eh? Deputato Gaspwingi?" The guard looked supremely confused and began to shuffle away from the smaller griffon to a booth by the door.\n\nGallus slammed his head into his claw. "Oh right, I don't speak Wingbardian."\n\nThe guard emerged accompanied by another griff wearing a ruffled suit, who approached Gallus and began to speak in extremely broken Griffish, "You are griffon from Equestria yes?" Gallus nodded, not wanting to explain he hadn't been there in a while, and was only coming here because Twilight had asked him to. "Yes yes, you meet with government, teach friendship!" Grabbing Gallus by the shoulder, the suited griffon dragged him inside the parliament building."
 wingbardy.81.a:0 ""What did I get myself into now?""

 wingbardy.812.t:0 "Gallus' Visit"
 wingbardy.812.d:0 ""So let me get your story straight." The imposing griffon rested his claws on his desk, "You were born in Griffonstone, and you're being raised by that Grandpa Gruff fellow. He then decided to send you all the way to Equestria as a griffon envoy to study under this "Princess of Friendship" named Twilight, to bring the values she represents back to Griffonstone." Gallus stared into his lap, not wanting to meet the griffon with his eyes; this King Garibald was one intimidating griffon, not very tall, but intimidating nonetheless. Gallus wasn't even sure how he hadn't gotten sick yet, then he heard Garibald sigh; "Ey, ragazzo, look up, won't you?" Gallus slowly raised his head, the King of Wingbardy seated in front of him, as a million thoughts, mainly of fear, raced through his head. "Look... Gallus. I do believe you. Equestria is a special place with strange customs, and I actually have a lot of respect for you learning to live and thrive there. Gruff put you in a difficult spot, and it seems you've come out fine." Gallus smiled. It seems the King wasn't that bad of a guy.\n\nBut before Gallus had time to let the comments sink in, a door to the office was thrown open, and an even scarier griffon stepped in. Wearing cold steel glasses with slicked-back grey and black hair, a three-piece suit, and a blue tie, Gallus immediately wondered what he had done wrong, and what terrible things this griffon would do to him. Instead, after seeing Gallus, a smile opened up on his face, larger than it seemed he was physically able to have. Rushing over to him, the griffon seized Gallus' claw and began to shake it, "Miei dei! Mr. Gallus, welcome to Wingbardy! We are so thrilled to have you here!" Seemingly only now noticing the King, the griffon released Gallus and turned to Garibald. "My King, apologies for this mishandling of the situation. When we received no reply from Equestria, we assumed Gallus would not be coming. But I see you two have already been acquainted." Garibald nodded, "It's okay Mr. Gaspwingi. Gallus is a lovely young griff." Gallus turned to the formally dressed griffon beside him, "You're Mr. Gaspwingi? Then you invited me here, right?" Gaspwingi nodded, "Yes Mr. Gallus. I've always been interested in the Equestrian way of life, and how we may adapt it to my native land. So when I heard a griffon had studied with the Princesses, why I had to invite him!"\n\nGaribald motioned for Gaspwingi to pull up another chair, then turned back to Gallus, "So Gallus. From what I was told, you are meant to teach us a bit about "friendship and harmony," now I am not quite versed on these subjects, but Giovanni here tells me they can help solve my nation's problems. So I am all ears." Gallus gulped, solve a nation's problems? He wasn't taught anything like that in school! What was Twilight thinking when she asked him to come here? No, Gallus thought, I can do this, I graduated the friendship school, and these griffons need some of what I learned. "Alright," he said, "what do you need to know first?""
 wingbardy.812.a:0 ""Tell me how to defeat enemies with friendship.""

 wingbardy.82.t:0 "The New Elections"
 wingbardy.82.d:0 "Now that the period of martial law has ended in Wingbardy, the time had come for fresh elections to hopefully break the deadlock in parliament that had lasted for so long. And just as many expected, Gallo Ventriglio and the PLW were outsted from their position as Prime Minister and major party of the Chamber of Deputies respectively, with the PPW taking their place and a majority of seats. Their leader, Don Luigi Guturzo is set to become the new Prime Minister of the country, and the citizenry is finally gaining hope in ending this deadlock and fixing the country to make Wingbardy great once more. Things are never that easy, though, and there is still one last issue to address.\n\nThe PPW does not have enough Deputies to pass laws and motions on their own. That means that, as usual in Wingbardian politics, coalitions will have to be made. Unfortunately the party has been split on who exactly to create a coalition with. Guturzo wishes to ally with both sides of the moderate political parties to create a centre coalition, while his second-in-command, Giovanni de Gaspwingi advocates a more leftist coalition with the socialists. With the concessions necessary we can not have both, and so one must be decided if we are to move forward as a party and a nation together."
 wingbardy.82.a:0 "A victory for democracy nonetheless!"

 wingbardy.83.t:0 "The Left PPW Take the Lead"
 wingbardy.83.d:0 "Following Luigi Guturzo's voluntary resignation as leader and temporary Prime Minister of the PPW, Giovanni de Gaspwingi has taken his place in both positions. A griffon who has long been Guturzo's close second, his leadership signals a shift to the left of the entire party, including his economic, political and diplomatic policies. He is known for his admiration of Equestria and its government, especially since the visit of the supposed student Gallus. Word has already spread of talks with the PLD, a party that has worked with the PPW in the past and the more controversial PSU, socialists who split off from the larger PSW due to their belief in the democratic system. The coalition in place, Gaspwingi is now in a strong position to push his agenda for a new, possibly more Equestrian Wingbardy."
 wingbardy.83.a:0 "Let us just hope he doesn't go too far with this..."

 wingbardy.84.t:0 "The Centre Ascent"
 wingbardy.84.d:0 "It seems that Wingbardy will remain on its current course today, for Don Guturzo has not budged on his position both for the PPW or for his leadership of the party. Both reigning in the liberal-leaning deputies and tightening the party unity once more, he is remaining Prime Minister and has already publicly courted the support of both the PLD, long-standing allies of the PPW as well as the PLW, the former lead party and having a much more conservative outlook. This coalition, just as Guturzo said and wanted is wide-reaching across the centre of Wingbardian politics, bringing in all sorts of moderates. With this support, the PPW finally has enough seats to break the political deadlock, and hopefully bring meaningful change to Wingbardy once more."
 wingbardy.84.a:0 "An alliance of centrism shall bring us peace!"
 
 wingbardy.85.t:0 "The Republic Vote"
 wingbardy.85.d:0 "The griffons of Wingbardy are in shock, for today the highly controversial "Republic Vote" has gotten the popular vote and been approved by Prime Minister Gaspwingi. Vehemently opposed by the conservatives in both the Chamber of Deputies and among the people, it is in all terms a complete abolishment of the monarchy in the nation, something many had thought unimaginable. During the reign of Talonuel II such a concept would have never passed as the King was too beloved by his people, but his son Gumberto II has shaken the once rock-hard faith of Wingbardians in the institution. Multiple liberal parties, led by the PPW itself capitalized on this and, though almost tearing the country in half in the process, got their support base to narrowly pass the law leaving Wingbardy a full republic.\n\nNow-former King Gumberto II has been unavailable for comment by the press, but sources inside the Royal Palace have reported him enraged at this development, calling it "a betrayal to the Kingdom and everything it stood for". Many royalists have followed suit, denouncing the act and agitating for a monarchist restoration immediately. They seem to be in the minority, however, and politicians are already widely accepting the end to the crown, and the start of a new age for the fledgling republic."
 wingbardy.85.a:0 "The end of an era for Wingbardy."

 wingbardy.86.t:0 "The Trans-Celestial Defence Training Plan"
 wingbardy.86.d:0 "A missive has reached us today, coming from the Wingbardians on Griffonia. In short it is an offer, a request for a joint training plan between our military and theirs to improve our combat readiness. They state the importance of being ready in case of an armed conflict, to defend one's own country and Harmony itself. We could learn much from them, and them from us, but some wonder if we should remain completely independent of Griffonian affairs, including such things as this. Should we go ahead?"
 wingbardy.86.a:0 "Yes, let us see what the Wingbardians can teach us."
 wingbardy.86.b:0 "No, there is no need for any of this."

 wingbardy.87.d:0 "To our utmost delight, the Equestrians have agreed to train with the Wingbardian military. Already our generals and soldiers are being sent all the way to Equestria for training, to teach and be taught about military theory. At the end of the session a few war games are scheduled which should help advance our study into doctrines, as well as give all our branches of the armed forces some experience in combat, even if only simulated."
 wingbardy.87.a:0 "Excellent!"

 wingbardy.88.t:0 "Equestria Rejects the Trans-Celestial Defence Training Plan"
 wingbardy.88.d:0 "To the unfortunate dismay of both the armed forces and the government, Equestria has rejected our proposal of a joint defense training regimen.

 wingbardy.90.d:0 "The new Republic of Karthinia has approached us with an offer recently, an offer for a so-called "Associate Status" in their nation. While they insist that it is purely a move to help bring the South together peacefully against certain shared threats to democracy, we can see beyond their thin facade. In purpose, to agree would be to sign away our independence, and eventually our status as a nation itself as many stipulations would see our land slowly absorbed into Karthinia. We of course believe in our sovereignty and the importance of our nation in the world, and yet perhaps joining their fledgling republic could prove to be better off for our citizens anyway? After all they do fervently espouse democracy and freedom as core values of the Griffonian South..." #TODO They want us to join the republic. We will become a puppet and they will annex us later.

A fellow Priest of Boreas, he has welcoming Eros' recent rise in the Empire and Wingbardian diplomats have been hard at work to create an official agreement between the Empire and the Southern Kingdom. However, the support has seemingly come with a catch. In return for promising to stay out of any affairs of the Empire and maintain close relations once more, the singular demand of the Wingbardians is for the Empire to respect the independence of both their kingdom, and that of all the Southwest Griffonian nations. Accepting would, of course, secure our flank and leave us open to pursue our other targets to restore the Empire. But can we really work with and acknowledge the independence of the first traitor who caused the Empire's downfall in the first place? The choice, in the end, is up to the regent."

With this promise to leave us alone, we may have indeed just secured peace and prosperity for not just Wingbardians, but all griffons who live here. Of course, there is a small catch in that should the Empire break its promise and attack a nation included in the treaty, Wingbardy is now honor-bound to come to their defense. Let us hope it does not come to that, but if it does, Arcturius will surely guide our blades to victory against any foe!"
 wingbardy.94.a:0 "Peace in our Time!"

 wingbardy.95.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Rejects our Diplomats"
 wingbardy.95.d:0 "Maar must surely have cursed us and our diplomats, for the Empire and the Archons have completely rebuffed our attempts at diplomacy. Stating that Wingbardy is nothing more than a stray breakaway and a rightful part of the Empire, Eros VII himself said that "the Empire has no business in dealing with traitors and subjects". Disappointing for many to be sure, especially Luigi Guturzo himself, but he will not let this frighten him or the Wingbardians. If the Empire and Wingbardy are truly destined to clash, then we shall do so with the might of Boreas on our side!"

Though many in the Chamber of Deputies had expected as much to happen eventually, it is an unfortunate blow for peace nonetheless. What is important now, though, is what Wingbardy should do. The agreement mandates now that we come to the defense of [From.GetNameDef], but generals in the military question whether we are ready to take on the Empire. Should we keep our promise, or bide our time and hope that a more opportune moment will come?"

 wingbardy.97.d:0 "Ever since the merger of the PSW into the PCW, some former socialists have protested this decision. Some call it illegitimate or even the result of a threat on the life of Gacci. Their preachings, while not gaining much traction, are an embarrassment for the government and make us look weak and ineffectual.\n\nThe only remaining question is what shall we do about it? Gacci has pleaded for Proletarino to let them continue to debate, and promises he had nothing to do with these protests. Bordiclaw insists that such debate should be kept to private party meetings and not bandied about publicly, and requests we censure them and redirect street protests to party debate. Proletarino, for his part, can't help but wonder if this is a dogwhistle for further reaction.\n\nWhat will General Secretary Proletarino do? Accepting Gacci's plea would mean losing face, but he's right about the need for democracy and debate among the party. Bordiclaw's solution could answer this without making the government look weak, although nobody else would be truly happy with such a compromise. Nonetheless, can Proletarino really trust so-called 'comrades' who until very recently preached reconciliation with the capitalists? It might be better to arrest the lot of them."
 wingbardy.97.a:0 "Gacci's right. Debate and dissent are a vital part of the communist process."

In his claws was a proposal that would make excellent use of the fascists, monarchists, and other reactionaries they'd captured in the civil war. As he arrived at the Supreme Council, he flashed a smile to Bordiclaw, and sat down next to him. To Gacci, who sat beside him on the other side, he offered nothing at all. The meeting was called to order, and Proletarino stood up.\n\n"Comrades," he began, "we have a great decision upon our claws. Even now, the Blackwings who murdered our friends and family members eat good food and give the people nothing, living as parasites upon our system from their gilded cage of prison. I ask you, is this justice? More importantly, is this good for the Party? One works or one starves, that is the creed of the fascists. I ask you, comrades, why should this not apply to them? I propose we move all the fascists in prison to labor camps, where they will mine and build for the good of the party and the honest workers."\n\n"You're talking about slavery," Gacci protested, rising to his feet. "Wasn't one of the goals of communism the liberation of all creatures from such awful states of life? Or, if you won't budge, can't you at least treat them well? Enough food, no cruelty, that kind of thing."\n\n"I'd go further than our General Secretary," a voice Proletarino didn't recognize called out. "Every political prisoner, no matter the type, shall work for the good of the PCW. They will suffer as an example to other would-be reactionaries.""

 wingbardy.99.t:0 "Decisions, Decisions..."
 wingbardy.99.d:0 "Antonino sipped his morning espresso, looking down at the proposals on his desk. Many of the party's old guard as well as the newly-absorbed revolutionary socialists who had proven their commitment to the cause were asking him to give up his emergency powers and restore normalcy. Two options had been proposed.\n\nThe first was a letter from Heinrich Redtail in Nova Griffonia congratulating him on his progress and urging him to restore Democratic Centralism. It was central to Steel Stallion's vision, the old revolutionary wrote, that the party be open to all and have a central role in guiding the revolution, with the general secretary as first among equals. This was indeed revolutionary orthodoxy and would be well-received, but if he opened up party membership and allowed them to vote on everything, Wingbardy could end up like Stalliongrad did in the Altidiya years: factionalised, indecisive, full of half measures, and with a sizeable wing of the party controlled by crypto-capitalists. The letter had been widely read given Redtail's fame as a father of the Winter Revolution, and the copy in front of him had been signed by scores of prominent party members.\n\nOne signature which was not there was Bordiclaw's. He had submitted his own idea, called 'organic centralism.' The proposal criticised democratic centralism as putting the party ahead of the revolution itself, and suggested instead a system encouraging open debate on the party program and mass literacy in Marksist theory so that any griffon could suggest new ideas. However, putting each idea to a popularity contest when it was usually clear which idea was in line with the needs of the revolution opened the door to opportunism. While Bordiclaw didn't say it, this would allow Antonino and the Politburo to be the final arbiters on what exactly went into the party program, although if they thought he was out of line the party could always remove him. This proposal was signed by Bordiclaw and some of the other members of the party old guard.\n\nThen there was a third option, which existed only in Antonino's mind. His party still had crypto-capitalists in its midst, and both proposals suggested expanding party membership which would bring more in, even if Bordiclaw did not want to see it. Working alone, Antonino had done more in one year than even Steel Stallion had in three. The emergency powers worked, and if he saw something that needed doing, why should he put it to a vote or have an interminable debate when it was clear what should be done? He could extend and legally codify his emergency powers, giving himself full control over the direction of the revolution. There would be defections and outrage, which would only help reveal the traitors in his ranks. He had accomplished so much in so little time, and the people would support him in the end."

 wingbardy.141.d.fascist:0 "Our status in standing with Wingbardy has long granted us their protection in the tumultuous times of Griffonia. However with recent events, they have slowly been pushing for more control over our own government, eroding away at our own national sovereignty.

 wingbardy.144.t:0 "The Gattei Way"
 wingbardy.144.d:0 "The foundation of the AGWP has not been an easy affair. Due to the poor economic situation of the kingdom, the project was originally underfunded. The original chairgriffon put in charge of the operation quickly departed for fear he was set up for failure or worse. In his stead emerged Genrico Gattei. Gattei was known as a rather crafty industrialist in Taloncana. Some of his ventures were impacted but instead of abandoning them like some others when the AGWP was created, he embraced it and began to lobby the government over participation in it. After all within the government began to see the position as doomed to fail, it was awarded to Gattei.\n\nUnder Gattei's leadership, the company was reorganised more efficiently along less bureaucratic lines. However, the budget of the AGWP was still an issue. Gattei's answer to it was the Taloncana scheme. With much fanfare and press coverage, he announced that incredibly rich methane and oil deposits were found in Taloncana and that soon, Wingbardy would become oil-independent. This quickly raised confidence in the company and many rich Wingbardians and capitalists began to buy into it, providing the company with some much-needed cash.\n\nThe reality was a bit less fantastic. Oil deposits were indeed found but they were very poor compared to the methane reserves. What he instead did was use the natural gas to boost the development of national industry in the region. The gas would be a cheaper and more functional substitute for the all-important coal imported at great expenses. As many of these industries belonged to Gattei's family or friends, he benefited highly from the move. This could have been one of the greatest scandal in Wingbardian history but the move ultimately lead to a boom in the region and the high profits were plowed back into the various branches of the AGWP, allowing them to grow even more and strike actual oil deposits.\n\nFar from getting fired over the scheme, Gattei became a media darling and a powerful political actor. Some are calling him corrupt and the move a threat to our government's integrity. Gattei prefers to call himself 'innovative'."
 wingbardy.144.a:0 "Wingbardy does need some innovation..."
 
 wingbardy.145.t:0 "Wingbardian Decolonisation"
 wingbardy.145.d:0 "Recently, the government of Wingbardy changed due to political instability, and it seems like the new government led by [From.GetLeader] has little interest in continuing aggressive colonial policies aimed at Abyssinia. In fact, they have offered to return all land that was previously taken from us through various means, rendering previous unequal treaties null and void. Their colonial troops are already vacating former Abyssinian territory, and the Ras of Purrsia is on his own, meaning he'll have to become an Abyssinian subject once again."

#Gumberto events
 wingbardy_gumberto.1.t:0 "The Heir Apparent"
 wingbardy_gumberto.1.d:0 "King Garibald Talonuel stepped out of the car and looked up at the trashed villa. He frowned at the broken wine bottles and the pink flamingo statue lying on the steps that led up to the half-open door. The King flew up the steps and landed softly by the door. One of his guards opened it.\n\nInside, it was dark and thick with cigar smoke, the stench of alcohol, and other smells he didn't dare think of. A passed-out griffon lay on a couch by the door. She was wearing a wine-stained bedsheet in the style of a Karthinian toga.\n\nLaughter echoed down the hall followed by the sounds of claws and paws scampering over the marble floor. Prince Gumberto skidded to a halt as he entered the hallway and saw his father. He was naked and his feathers damp and stained with food and wine. "F-Father!?"\n\n"Son, we need to talk."\n\nA second laughing griffon ran in, this one wearing a Blackwing uniform. The guards reached for their guns but the King gestured for them to stop. The Blackwing almost fell over himself as he saw the king and armed guards.\n\n"Y-Your Majesty!"\n\n"Leave us."\n\nThe griffon's face was bright red as he bowed and quickly scampered away.\n\n"This is my house, Father," Gumberto snapped. "You can't just come in here and—"\n\n"I gave you this villa. It was built by my grandfather," Garibald said coldly as he glared up at his son. "And you disgrace it with yet another one of your parties." He felt a sense of boldness towards his son overcome him. "You are not fit for the crown. You will be a disgrace to the throne and our family's legacy. How can you properly govern when you spend your time acting in such an ungodly manner? You know nothing of what it means to be king. Now get in the car."\n\nGumberto was startled but after a moment shook his head. "No.""

There was a painting of his grandfather King Garibald Talonuel II hanging crookedly on the wall. He took a moment to straighten the painting and wipe a layer of dust off the frame with his handkerchief before returning to his own car.\n\nGumberto will have to learn to be king one way or another."

He won't listen to me," King Garibald replied.\n\nJelena sighed and placed her talons on his shoulders. She was bigger then most griffons and towered over him like he was still just a fledgling. "Be patient with him. He has always been stubborn just like you."\n\nThe door opened and Gumberto stormed in. "Good evening, mother," he said with a polite nod. Then, as if as an afterthought, he turned to Garibald. "Father."\n\nQueen Jelena frowned but said nothing, taking her seat at the table. King Garibald followed suit. The royal chefs came out with dinner, a meal fit for only the highest of nobility.\n\nWhat followed was a very quiet dinner."

He will come, I am sure of it."\n\nThe door opened and Gumberto walked in, his uniform ruffled and obviously put on in a rush. "Good evening, mother," he said with a polite nod as he took his seat. "Good evening, father."\n\n"Good evening, son," he responded. The chefs came out and served their food, meals fit for royalty. After they had departed, Garibald finally continued. "Son, we need to talk about your habits."\n\nHis son put down his fork. "Really, father? Must you start with this again?"\n\n"Gumberto, please." The Prince turned to his mother, who was looking at him with pleading eyes. "Listen to your father, he only means the best for you."\n\nPrince Gumberto looked back and forth, from his mother to his father. "Fine," he finally relented, "I'll listen.

 wingbardy_gumberto.6.t:0 "The Many Addictions Of Gumberto"
 wingbardy_gumberto.6.d:0 "Prince Gumberto was fond of many substances. Perhaps too fond. He treasured his cigars from Puerto Caballo, occasionally indulged in opium, experimented with inhaling powdered magical crystals and above all worshipped wine. While the King had an impressive collection of stamps, Gumberto was building up his own hoard of expensive wines from all across Griffonia and beyond. Yet the size of the hoard hardly grew as he consumed wine as quickly as he acquired it.\n\nThe King knew something had to be done about Gumberto's addictions before they would get completely out of control. He had two options in mind: The first was to simply confiscate all addictive substances he owned and pressure him to go "cold turkey" as the saying went. The second was to seek professional help from the finest Wingbardian doctors who could help with his rehabilitation. The former was more risky, as withdrawal symptoms would be likely, but the latter was more expensive and wouldn't really teach any lessons to Gumberto. He felt like the Prince had to learn the hard way, otherwise he'd just return to hedonistic consumption again.\n\nOne thing was for certain: Gumberto wouldn't like this either way."
 wingbardy_gumberto.6.a:0 "No more drugs for him!"

 wingbardy_gumberto.7.t:0 "Going Cold Turkey"
 wingbardy_gumberto.7.d:0 "More than two weeks had gone by since the King had confiscated all addictive substances from his son, and told royal guards to keep a close eye on him in case he had a secret stash somewhere.\n\nAt first, Gumberto was outraged, throwing a fit and cursing his father in colourful ways. On the following day, his anger was gone as the withdrawal symptoms began to set in. He was feeling nauseous, complaining from headache. The next two days he spent almost entirely in bed, occasionally vomiting and shaking. On the fifth day, his condition slowly began to improve, and he even went for a short walk outdoors. However on the sixth day things worsened again as he had high fever and was given some medication to ease his suffering.\n\nThe next week went without incidents as he slowly recovered and returned to normal. The guards who were watching him did say that Gumberto tried to bribe them in return for alcohol. Nevertheless, his craving for drink weakened as time went on, though he still held a grudge against his father for making him go through such an atrocious experience."
 wingbardy_gumberto.7.a:0 "The first steps are always the most difficult to take."
 
 wingbardy_gumberto.8.t:0 "Rehabilitation"
 wingbardy_gumberto.8.d:0 "The King grabbed Gumberto out to meet with a doctor specialized in drug rehabilitation. While Gumberto was reluctant to cooperate, he nevertheless answered the doctor's questions. The doctor diagnosed him with alcohol dependence due to constant consumption of alcohol and constant desire to acquire more of it. She prepared a program to rehabilitate the Prince. First, he would have to go through alcohol detoxification by gradually reducing the amount of alcohol consumed to healthy levels. Then, he would have to avoid "corrupting" company and instead socialize with abstinent individuals and other recovering alcoholics. Lastly, he'd have to regularly meet with a counselor who would track his progress and provide him advice.\n\nGumberto was sceptical at first, but with gentle encouragement from his father, he slowly began to follow the program. He drank less and less alcohol and made new friends who did not care for drinks much. His craving for alcohol weakened and he even began using other drugs less. While he did not openly thank his father, Garibald knew he was just too proud to do so."
 wingbardy_gumberto.8.a:0 "His recovery begins."
 
 wingbardy_gumberto.9.t:0 "The Issue of Friends"
 wingbardy_gumberto.9.d:0 "Standing on the balcony of the Royal Palace, King Garibald Talonuel watched as Prince Gumberto got out of the car that had pulled up in the front plaza, laughing at something another griffon had said. The King scowled when he saw what the griffons were wearing, prominent Blackwing uniforms proudly adorned with various symbols of Beakolini's fading ideology. Gumberto waved goodbye to them as the car drove off the estate, seeming to be in a good mood. King Garibald made his way back into the palace, taking a route to make sure he intercepted his son before he made it to his room.\n\nThe Prince's high spirits faded immediately when Garibald blocked his way. "What is it now, Father?" he asked with an exasperated tone.\n\nThe King chose to get straight to the point. "The griffons you choose to fraternize with are negative influences on you, son. They are nothing but trouble, and I do not want you associating with them any longer."\n\n"First you hound me for my parties, and now this?" Prince Gumberto looked his father straight in the eyes, unflinching. "They are my friends, father. Those griffons understand me better than you ever have, and they know-"\n\n"They know nothing," Garibald interrupted. "They will never understand the responsibilities and duties of a true king. And neither will you, if you continue falling under their influence."\n\nHis son shook his head, continuing his look of defiance. "I am my own griffon, father! I get to choose who are my friends, and I choose them! I am not under their influence, and I refuse to be under yours!" The Prince spoke with a strong, clear, and most importantly authoritative voice, making clear his opinion on this.\n\nNeither griffon backed down, neither side flinched. They both stood eye-to-eye, staring each other down, showing no weakness. After a full minute in the hall, King Garibald spoke."
 wingbardy_gumberto.9.a:0 ""You will find new friends, and that is final.""
 wingbardy_gumberto.9.b:0 ""Very well, but the fascists have to go.""

 wingbardy_gumberto.10.d:0 "Prince Gumberto walked out of the building somewhere on the coast of Karthin, where the King was waiting for him. "So?" he inquired, waiting for a response.\n\nHe huffed. "It was terrible, father. We had nothing in common, and I can already tell those Harmonists don't like me. This was just a waste of time."\n\n"You have nothing in common because you are still acting like your old friends. It is you who needs to change, my son, not them."\n\n"And what if I can't, father?!" The Prince's voice started rising in anger. "I am me, and that isn't going to change! New friends aren't going to do anything!" He stormed past King Garibald, getting into the car and slamming the door behind him.\n\nThe King took a deep breath before following his son. This was necessary for the Kingdom and for Gumberto. It may take time, and more force, but eventually his new compatriots would help him become a better prince and a better griffon."

 wingbardy_gumberto.11.d:0 "As Prince Gumberto met with his group of friends once again on the front yard of the Royal Palace, King Garibald Talonuel watched silently from one of the windows on the second floor. He knew those griffons currently talking with his son, after all he had met them many times while pulling Gumberto away from his parties. They were all hedonists just like the Prince, drinkers and carefree children of nobles. But at the very least, there were no more Blackwings among them. King Garibald had been very thorough on that, making it abundantly clear to all of them that their presence would no longer be tolerated among the royal family.\n\nHe was not pleased with those who were left. But that was part of the compromise that he had made with his son. At the very least, the Prince would no longer fall to a fascist influence and take the kingdom with it. He may still be a disappointment and a failure, but he would not be a puppet of Beakolini's ideology.\n\nAnd perhaps, that was good enough."

He knew those griffons currently talking with his son, after all he had met them many times while pulling Gumberto away from his parties. Most were hedonists just like the Prince, drinkers and carefree children of nobles. The rest were even worse, Blackwings in their uniforms laughing alongside the Prince. King Garibald had tried pushing Gumberto away from them before, tried keeping him from their infectious ideology. But he kept gravitating back to them, no matter what he did. Their last meeting had made that clear as crystal.\n\nThey were without a doubt the most dangerous griffons close to the Prince. Some did not party or drink, instead they discussed politics and every day influenced Gumberto more and more. Garibald could only hope that he could stand up to their advances, remain loyal to the kingdom and the kingdom alone.\n\nOtherwise, all Wingbardians would suffer when the crown passes to him."

But earlier today, Gumberto's housemaid discovered him passed out in his room, surrounded by empty bottles of wine and burnt out cigars. He was immediately taken to the hospital and the King arrived as soon as he heard what had happened.\n\nIt seemed Gumberto was going through relapse, unable to hold back his cravings. Garibald was deeply disappointed, but knew that getting angry at his son would resolve nothing. While Gumberto recovered, the King thought about what to do instead. He felt like he had been too strict before, and that this had caused Gumberto's addiction to resurface. Perhaps allowing him to indulge in alcohol and narcotics every now and then would help him keep things under control? On the other claw, he could put his paw down and send him to receive more effective treatment that would prevent another relapse. Gumberto would like the first option more, but it could just result in his addictions never truly being resolved..."

He even made contacts with his old friends who he used to party with. Yet he was careful to keep his addiction under control, at least in public.\n\nYet soon enough his wine cellar began to fill up again, and his clothes regained the stench of cigars. In the end, Garibald felt like he had simply allowed Gumberto to return to his old ways. Perhaps it was only a matter of time before he would overdose again..."

This way a way to fulfill his needs that didn't involve addictive substances could be discovered.\n\nAfter several hours of questioning, the therapist concluded that Gumberto craved emotionally strong experiences which could also help with gaining friends. As an alternative to drug abuse, she recommended various sports and hobbies which would provide the intensity he was looking for while also having a social dimension. Out of options listed, Gumberto liked the sound of car racing. His father promised to provide him with any funds he needed.\n\nSoon enough, Gumberto had acquired a Taloncia racing car and was practicing by driving in the countryside. He became a member of a racing club and soon enough participated in races with others. His wine collection was eventually replaced with a collection of shining racecars. While the royal treasury was drained, at least Gumberto now cared little for drugs."

 wingbardy_gumberto.16.t:0 "Visiting the Troops"
 wingbardy_gumberto.16.d:0 ""Why must I be here again, father?" Prince Gumberto complained as they walked across the streets of Karthin. "I have better things to do than this."\n\n"Because you will be King one day, and with that title comes the responsibility of leading your troops." The two griffons turned into an entryway, which opened into a courtyard filled with soldiers in formation standing at attention. They saluted as soon as they noticed the King enter. "These are the griffons that fight for you and Wingbardy, and you must understand and respect that."\n\nGumberto fell silent as he followed his father up to a high balcony where they could see the entire regiment at once. Garibald stepped forward, ensuring that all the soldiers could hear him. "Soldiers of Wingbardy! Tumultuous times have befallen the Kingdom, and though we may have weathered the worst, war is still on the horizon! If we are to survive today, we must be ready to fight our enemies, wherever they may appear! And Wingbardy will rely on all of you to win that fight! So I ask you all to trust in me to lead you to victory, should the time come against when we are under threat, so that we will surely be victorious!"\n\n"Vive il Re!" the soldiers shouted back in unison.\n\nThe King turned to look at the Prince, who was still watching impatiently. "So that was what you brought me here for? To watch you give a speech?"\n\nGaribald shook his head. "No, son. I brought you here to...""
 wingbardy_gumberto.16.a:0 ""...understand the responsibilities when they are loyal to you and yours to command.""
 wingbardy_gumberto.16.b:0 ""...gain the respect of the soldiers you will lead.""

 wingbardy_gumberto.17.t:0 "A Different Idea"
 wingbardy_gumberto.17.d:0 "It had been two hours since the royals had arrived at the courtyard. Prince Gumberto, right after the King's speech had been conversing with the soldiers, talking while they were on break from training. However, by the later part of the second hour most were either ignoring or flat-out telling him off, leaving a very irritated Prince as he and the King left the regiment.\n\n"What is it, son?" Garibald asked, clearly sensing something off.\n\n"Those soldiers just don't understand!" Gumberto said bitterly. "They don't respect or listen to me at all! It's like they don't even care that I am Prince!"\n\nKing Garibald paused, looking at Gumberto a bit confused. "You must respect them as well, my son. If you do not, then they will not respect you."\n\n"They are MY soldiers! You said they would be loyal to ME and MINE to command! If I tell them to fight, then they should fight for me, because I will be king!"\n\n"Gumberto, that is not..." How could Garibald even deal with this? The Prince didn't even seem to be listening to him anymore, instead indulging in his anger and his mad power fantasies of the future. The King only continued walking, ignoring the ranting close behind."
 wingbardy_gumberto.17.a:0 "That's not what I was intending for him to think..."
 
 wingbardy_gumberto.18.t:0 "Respect"
 wingbardy_gumberto.18.d:0 ""Prince Gumberto!" The griffon looked over to his father, who had called out to him. "It is time to go." Nodding at the soldiers he had been speaking with, Gumberto hurried over to King Garibald, who began walking him out of the courtyard. "How was it?"\n\nThe Prince shrugged. "It was interesting, I suppose. They treated me alright, and we talked for a bit. They seem to think highly of you, though."\n\nGaribald nodded. "Yes. And one day they will think the same of you, if you gain their respect just as I have. A soldier who does not respect his King or his leader will never fight well for anything but himself. But one who does will follow them to the ends of the world, and fight Maar himself should his King command. That is what you need if you are to rule your armies one day."\n\nGumberto only frowned. "You got their respect in a war. Where will I get it?"\n\nThe King placed a talon on his son's shoulder. "I do not know, son. But if you continue to improve yourself, be the best griffon and Prince you can, I am sure your own opportunity will arise to prove yourself worthy to your soldiers. You just need to try.""
 wingbardy_gumberto.18.a:0 "If the soldiers respect him, then he will have their true loyalty."
 
 wingbardy_gumberto.19.t:0 "Of Soldiers and Kings"
 wingbardy_gumberto.19.d:0 ""How was it?"\n\nPrince Gumberto didn't look at his father as they walked away from the courtyard. "It was... fine. Everything the captain ordered me to do was harder than the last, and he yelled at me whenever I was too slow with the exercises, but there were a few soldiers there that I liked." He gave a tired huff, his clothes still drenched in sweat from the activities. "We actually had a lot in common. It was nice being able to talk about things while we did it.""\n\n"So what do you think about a soldier now?"\n\nGumberto stopped to look at his father. "It's... much more difficult than I thought it would be. I imagined it was easy, just waiting around until they pick up a gun and shoot someone, but it's not."\n\nThe King nodded his head. "Yes. You need to understand the hardships that they go through every day to protect the Kingdom, just as I did during the Falcor War. Once you understand and show that you are weathering hardship alongside them, then you will truly be their King and their leader."\n\nGumberto remained silent for a moment. "I think I might come back and do it again sometime. Talking and exercising with soldiers is... nice." Garibald looked at him in surprise, but for once it was the good kind. Maybe he was finally changing for the better..."
 wingbardy_gumberto.19.a:0 "Well that was a pleasant surprise."
 
 wingbardy_gumberto.20.t:0 "Back Where we Started"
 wingbardy_gumberto.20.d:0 "Getting out of the car, King Garibald Talonuel looked up at the villa he had visited so long ago. It had seemed like an eternity since he had first pulled his son from this place, and yet the scene was eerily similar to how he had left it. Even as the King walked up the stairs to the door, a wine bottle flew out the front window and shattered where it landed on the ground. After a single second, he opened the door and walked inside.\n\nThe interior was better than his first visit, but for all the wrong reasons. The cigar smoke was gone, but there was a fresh pack lying on the table. The stench of wine lingered, and a dozen unopened bottles were arranged on the shelves. His grandfather's portrait, the painting of King Garibald II was off it's place on the wall, knocked over and laying haphazardly on the floor. Prince Gumberto was in the middle of the room, holding a half-empty wine bottle. As soon as he noticed his father he smiled, obviously already drunk. "Hello, father."\n\n"Have I taught you nothing?" Garibald asked, more disappointed than angry.\n\nGumberto's smile turned into a frown. "Were your punishments supposed to teach me anything? All you did was try to make me into another version of you, father. Why would I care for somegriff who does not care about me?" He took another swig of wine. "Now get out, I have a party with my real friends."\n\nGaribald wanted to argue, to rebuff him and pull him out from this house, but he just could not find the motivation to. It was clear that no matter what he had tried, Prince Gumberto would not abandon his hedonistic way. Shaking his head, he silently turned and walked out, closing the door behind him.\n\nIt seems that now, the monarchy truly is doomed."
 wingbardy_gumberto.20.a:0 "It was all for naught..."
 
 wingbardy_gumberto.21.t:0 "The Results"
 wingbardy_gumberto.21.d:0 "King Garibald had not seen his son for a few days now. This was fairly odd, as even before he had started tutoring his son the King usually saw him at least once a day, even if it was just him fetching more wine or going to his bedroom in the Royal Palace. Something had changed, and he was unsure what it was.\n\nHopefully, Gumberto had turned over a new leaf and was bettering himself on his own. Perhaps he had taken Garibald's lessons and teachings to heart and had abandoned his shameful ways. He could be somewhere behaving like a true royal and taking his position seriously, as the King had hoped. Of course he may also just be somewhere partying and drinking as usual. It would be disappointing, yet expected of the Prince.\n\nEither way, Garibald was tired of waiting to find out. He was going to find his son, no matter where he was or what he was doing, and hope for the best. For all the kingdom may depend on it."
 wingbardy_gumberto.21.a:0 "Let's see what the Prince is up to."
 
 wingbardy_gumberto.22.t:0 "Trading Devils"
 wingbardy_gumberto.22.d:0 "The King of Wingbardy did not find his son at a bar, or his villa, or in any of the places he had first expected. No, the place he had found the Prince was quite simple, a nondescript building in the outer reaches of Karthin. It was the company he was with that was troubling.\n\nEvery single griffon other than Gumberto himself was wearing a Blackwing uniform.\n\n"Son, what are you doing here?" he asked as he approached the desk that Gumberto and a few others were sitting at.\n\nThe Prince looked up, setting down the pen he was holding on the desk. "My friends invited me over here to help on a few things, so I agreed. The better question is what are you doing here, father?"\n\n"I came to find you." He looked around, gesturing at all the griffons surrounding them. "Gumberto, why do you associate with these griffons? Haven't I warned you enough about them? About the dangers of extremism? The violence?"\n\nGumberto's face surprisingly did not show anger, instead it just showed plain annoyance. "Again with this, father? I've already told you, these are my friends. They've helped me when I needed it, showed me that I didn't need my drinks or my parties to have friends and allies." He picked the pen back up, no longer even looking at Garibald. "Isn't this what you wanted?"\n\nThe King tried to formulate a response but couldn't. He may have saved his son from his hedonism, yes. But it seemed that he had lost him instead to something far worse. Without another word, he left the building, leaving nothing but disappointment and fear.\n\nPerhaps the monarchy was saved, but the tradition of Wingbardy was doomed."
 wingbardy_gumberto.22.a:0 "We traded one devil for another..."
 
 wingbardy_gumberto.23.t:0 "A King of Fascism"
 wingbardy_gumberto.23.d:0 "Surprisingly, Garibald did not have to look far to find his son in Karthin. Instead, Gumberto was actually drawing crowds in a square, on a makeshift podium where all could see him. As the King got out of the car he could just hear the end of what the Prince was saying.\n\n"...And that is why I promise that I will uphold my duty as Prince and future King of Wingbardy, to lead us into a new golden age and bring glory to the Kingdom!" The griffons cheered for him, clapped and hollered as he finished his speech. King Garibald could barely believe it, this change from what was one a drunken disappointment to the royal family. Everything was just as he has hoped, from Gumberto's strong voice and expression, to the adoring Wingbardians, to... the Blackwing symbol displayed on his son's outfit, and the Blackwing members strewn about the plaza. No, this was all wrong! Quickly, he flew over to his son who had just walked off the stage.\n\n"Oh, father!" Gumberto said, surprised. "I didn't expect to see you here."\n\n"Son, what is all this?" Garibald gestured to everything; the podium, the crowd, the Blackwings. "What are you doing?"\n\nGumberto gave a small grin. "I'm doing my duty as the Prince of Wingbardy. I really have to thank you, father. If it wasn't for you, or my friends-" he looked at the Blackwings closest to him, who were looking a little confused at why the King of Wingbardy was here, "-I would never have discovered what it means to be the King one day. You helped me become a better griffon and find out my true duty." The Prince pulled Garibald into a hug.\n\nAnd the King of Wingbardy did not know what to do. It was all so... twisted, all so wrong. It was so close to being what he had wanted his son to become, the leader that Wingbardy would need when he would pass on, the next King in a long line of tradition.\n\nBut Beakolini's dastardly ideology had grabbed its claws onto his son, and now they were never going to let go."
 wingbardy_gumberto.23.a:0 "Was the price we had to pay worth it?"
 
 wingbardy_gumberto.24.t:0 "A Disappointment No Longer"
 wingbardy_gumberto.24.d:0 "When Prince Gumberto was not at any of the locations that King Garibald has expected to find him in, he was pleasantly surprised. After asking a few griffons he knew in Karthin, he found that his son was last seen heading one of the many noble estates in the countryside of Wingbardy. Worried that he was going out to party and drink once more, the King immediately followed and soon found himself in the middle of a ballroom, watching the Prince from across the room mingle with the nobility. But he was not drinking or partying, he was simply laughing and talking with some friends and other nobles around his age. He had a wine glass in a talon, but it was only half empty and he was barely drinking it.\n\nGumberto, finally seeing his father in the crowd, excused himself and made his way over to the King. "Hello, father," he said politely. "Apologies for not telling you were I was going, some of my friends kept me from doing so."\n\n"It is fine," he responded, keeping up a mask of dignity. "But Prince Gumberto, what are you doing here?"\n\n"My friends actually invited me here, though I believe they just wanted to steal from the wine cellar. I chose to use it to make some friends in the nobility. They might still be my friends, but I want to put my past behind me."\n\nGaribald blinked. He had certainly matured. The fact that he was still meeting with his old debaucherous friends was worrying, but his own improvement was startling. Perhaps not a perfect prince, but definitely not a disappointment.\n\nGumberto waited a bit uncomfortably at his father's silence before taking his claw and pulling him through the ballroom. "Oh, father, have you met the Countess of Pluma? She is a wonderful griffon, and she says she'd love to meet you. I'm sure that you and her will have plenty to talk about...""
 wingbardy_gumberto.24.a:0 "Wingbardy's future is bright once more."
 
 wingbardy_gumberto.25.t:0 "The New Heir"
 wingbardy_gumberto.25.d:0 ""Father, I'm home!" Just as Garibald was getting ready to leave to look for Gumberto, he heard the voice of his son as the front door closed. "Apologies, the trip went on for longer than I expected."\n\n"What trip?" Garibald inquired as the Prince sat on a chair, still in his royal uniform. "Where did you go?"\n\nGumberto let himself relax and settle in before responding. "I took a royal tour around the Kingdom. I wanted to see my future subjects, learn about the nation I will be ruling one day. I gave a speech in Talcara, Wrobert, even Falcor. I wanted to let the people know that I care and that I will be a good king when it is time."\n\n"I... see."\n\n"Father, I-" Gumberto stopped for a moment, unsure how to proceed. "I wanted to apologize also for my actions in recent years. I know I haven't been the best son, or the best prince either. I didn't care for anything, even you. But I realize now what I have to do, how many griffons will be relying on my leadership soon. I don't know everything I need to be king, but I wanted to ask; could you teach me?"\n\nGaribald was shocked. He had never expected his son to change this much, to improve this much. Slowly, he walked forward and pulled Gumberto into a hug. "Of course, my son. Thank you for apologizing.\n\n"No. Thank you, father. For staying with me all the way, for pushing me to improve no matter what. Thank you for everything.""

One moved through the trees with the pace of a seasoned veteran, making no noise as he walked. The other clumsily followed close behind, snapping almost every stick in his way.\n\n"Father, when will we find something? It's been hours," Gumberto complained. "We should just head back to Karthin."\n\n"Patience, my son. The opportunity will come to us if we wait for it." Garibald put up a single claw from his talon, silencing his son before he responded. "Do you hear that?"\n\nGumberto listened closely before looking to his right. There, a single white rabbit was sitting, seemingly having not noticed them yet. "Now watch," the King said quietly, raising his rifle. "This is how you hunt. You aim for the head to ensure a clean kill."\n\n"Father, wait." The Prince raised his rifle as well alongside Garibald. "Let me try first. I can do this."\n\n"Gumberto, you have never fired a rifle in your life-"\n\n"Please, father."

 wingbardy_gumberto.28.d:0 ""Where is he?" King Garibald Talonuel muttered to himself as he sat at a dining table at his royal estate. He had invited many nobles from all across Wingbardy for a great state dinner, not only to catch up with some old friends but also to teach his son about such events and how to act in them. Unfortunately that was looking less and less likely to happen, as he was already half an hour late. The Prince's seat at the table was noticably empty, even as the meal was in full swing.\n\nAs if on cue, the doors opened and Gumberto walked in. "Sorry I'm late, father," he said breezily. "Friends made me stay later than I thought."\n\nAll the nobles present stared at him. "My apologies," Garibald said finally, "but I will need to speak with my son for a moment." He got out of his chair and made his way out of the dining room, practically pulling his son along the way.\n\n"Have you any idea how late you are?" The King asked furiously after they had gotten out of earshot. "Punctuality is everything, Gumberto! You can not simply lay off a state dinner until later!"\n\nGumberto shrugged. "I didn't even want to be here, anyway. If being late is so bad, why don't you let me just leave already?"\n\nGaribald was just about to rebuff him when he stopped for a moment. Was this really worth the effort? Letting him leave would certainly ease his strain for the dinner, even if his son wouldn't learn anything from it..."

 wingbardy_investigation.1.t:0 "The Suspects"
 wingbardy_investigation.1.d:0 "Over the countless years that the King has been forced to wait for justice to be brought, he has not always stood idly by until the perfect opportunity. Through his own old investigations and that of the SIM, they have narrowed the suspects down to four likely candidates.\n\nThe first is Archon Eros VII. A close friend of Grover V and zealot of the Empire, he is known for having a hatred of Wingbardy ever since we originally seceded from the Empire. He was in attendance at the birthday party and sources say he mysteriously disappeared right before the murder. He also does not drink alcohol, as it is unbefitting of his position.\n\nThe second is Marie Discret, a former member of the Aquileian royal family who died during the first Aquileian Revolution. She was a second cousin thrice removed to Moriset on the maternal side, and carried an immense hatred of both the Empire and Wingbardy. In fact, she was seen at Grover's party calling King Gumberto "a disgrace to nobility on all of Griffonia" shortly before his murder.\n\nThird is a Skyfallian merchant named Marijke Redclaw. One of the richer griffons in the Empire at the time, she had attempted to get a lucrative trade deal from Gumberto and Wingbardy at the party, but was rebuffed for her shady business practices and dishonest dealings. Her response was less than pleasant, and King Garibald had never seen her again after that incident.\n\nThe last suspect is a Field Marshal of the Griffonian Empire, Erich Ebonwing. Son of a Baron, he is very loyal to the Empire, and is charismatic and resourceful. Back then, he was well-known among the nobility for his drinking and partying, and was one of the spotlights at Grover's birthday party. However, he mysteriously disappeared from the location following Gumberto's death."

After all, he was just a Wingbardian tourist taking in the sights of the city, and most definitely not a secret agent for the Servizio Informazioni Militare, or SIM. In reality, he was simply waiting for his partners to report back, as they were all around the courtyard and the surrounding area trying to find any clues possibly left behind from the murder all those years ago. Personally, Gavino had his doubts about this whole operation, but the government had asked for it so he had obeyed.\n\nA slight breeze began to pick up across the cobblestone space as three griffons, all wearing tourist outfits made their way towards Gavino. "Excellent timing," he said to them as the bell far away began to chime three in the afternoon. "So, what did you find?"\n\n"Nothing, sir," the first replied. "It seems that all the possible evidence was either already gathered by the Imperials or washed away by the decades since the murder."\n\n"Obviously," another grumbled. Gavino shot him a vicious glare. "What?" he asked defensively. "You said yourself that this was probably a waste of time."\n\nThe agent held back the urge to sigh. "Yes, but that does not mean I can not hope otherwise. Come on, let's get moving before the Imperials get suspicious." The three nodded and followed Gavino out of the courtyard, bringing out tourist pamplets and starting to speak broken Griffish.\n\nThe search had been a dead end, just as the SIM expected it to be."

Matters like greeting the guests, speaking with the nobility on their personal wealth, and other such trivialities. They were all distractions from his real reason for hosting the Royal Ball tonight, that being speaking with the very nobles who were attending with him at Grover V's twelfth birthday party. In particular was one Duke Geovanni of Bloodtalon, a griffon he remembered the most from that night.\n\n"Duke Geovanni," Garibald began respectfully as he approached the noble, "it is a pleasure to meet you once again."\n\n"As to you, my King," the Duke responded, bowing before him. "So to what do I owe the pleasure?"\n\nGaribald stiffened a little. "I must ask for your assistance in gathering evidence for the murder of my father, King Gumberto. I have recently reopened the investigation into it."\n\n"Ah, yes," he responded, nodding along. "That was indeed a terrible night. My memory has been failing me recently, but I will never forget the time we lost our King."\n\n"What do you remember from that night, Duke Geovanni?"\n\nThe old griffon scratched his chin with a claw.

What I do know is that the time between him leaving the hall and hearing your call for help was so short that it could not have been anyone else. He must have left with his murderer."\n\nGaribald nodded, processing this new information. "And you are sure that you can not remember anything else? Any details about the griffon?"\n\nThe Duke shook his head sadly. "I am sorry, my King. Perhaps years ago I could have told you more, when I was still young and my mind still sharp. But now..." He gestured to his greying feathers. "I am not the griffon I used to be."\n\n"It is alright, you have told as much as you could. Thank you for this information, Duke Geovanni."\n\nThe noble bowed before making his way back into the thick of the Grand Ball. Garibald stood there for a few moments, mulling over the revelation that had been given to him. Perhaps it was not the best evidence, or the most conclusive.

The two were silent for a moment, before the Duke suddently snapped his claws. "But I do know somegriff who could tell you. I have a former friend in the Empire, Baron Helheim. He may hate Wingbardy now, but he still owes me a favor. If you say that I'm calling in that favor, he will tell you everything you wish to know."\n\n"And you are sure we can trust him?"\n\nGeovanni laughed. "Of course not, he's an Imperial noble! But he is also honorable, and I am sure he will uphold his end of the bargain."\n\nThe King paused for a second, thinking it over before speaking once more. "I thank you, Duke Geovanni.

There were a few guards here and there, but they were all sleeping; after all, thirty year old records are not something considered by most to require the utmost security.\n\nThe intruders stopped at an intersection of passageways, leading left and right. A convenient sign was on the wall in front, labeling which direction led where. A few seconds passed, the only sounds being the faint ticking of a grandfather clock somewhere inside the building.\n\n"We should head to the weapon seizure records," the first masked griffon said, pointing to the left. "The King said he knows his father was stabbed, so we just need to look at whoever had a knife taken and given back during the event and we'll have our claws on the murderer."\n\nThe second griffon shook their head. "We should head left, but to the mail records. There has to be something sent that could give us a trail. The best, most solid evidence we can get is from a letter somegriff wrote."\n\n"We need to stick to the mission!" the third argued, hissing out in a low tone. "We were sent to get the Imperial files on King Gumberto, and that is what we should do! We need to head right!"\n\n"Well we only can bring back one set of files." All three griffons turned to their leader, Gavino Garritano. "Which one should we grab, sir?""

 wingbardy_investigation.7.d:0 "Garibald sat in a chair within his royal bedroom, in deep contemplation. Over the past few weeks or so, he had taken time out of his day to relax, take a deep breath, and try to remember what had happened that night his father died. There must have been some detail he had missed, some important clue he had brushed off or simply forgotten at that time. And if such a thing existed, he was determined to find it.\n\nThe scene Garibald could remember clearly. The cobblestones beneath his talons, the blood of his father soaking his royal clothing, the sound of his choking on his own blood. It was painful to recall, how the Imperials flocked to the scene, how they all stared on at him holding his father's corpse, the Emperor still too tired to even understand what was going on, the faint smell of alcohol within the air...\n\nWait. That smell. It was the distinct smell of wine. Garibald could not recall a single instance during the party that his father had drank, instead preferring to stay sober and watch the other nobles make a fool of themselves. But yet the scent of wine on King Gumberto's clothes was present, mixing with the smell of his blood. Garibald could almost name that exact type of wine, he had tasted it before, it was... it was...\n\nAnd then it was gone. As quickly as it had come, the memory had faded once more. Garibald resisted the urge to pound the table in anger, instead focusing once more on the memory of his memory. What was that wine that he had remembered?"
 wingbardy_investigation.7.a:0 "It was the Imperial's wine, from Strawberry!"
 wingbardy_investigation.7.b:0 "It was the wine from the South, the vineyards of Francistria!"

 wingbardy_investigation.8.t:0 "An Uneasy Meeting"
 wingbardy_investigation.8.d:0 ""What do you want?" The gruff Griffish voice called out to the Wingbardians without even turning to them as the four landed swiftfully to the ground. "If you're from Skyfall, I don't have to pay my debt until next week."\n\n"We aren't from Skyfall, no," Gavino Garritano responded, taking off his mask.\n\nThe Imperial turned, snarling. "Wingbardians. Come to assassinate me or steal my fortune, have you?" He pulled out a dagger from his robes. "Well I won't be going down without a fight!"\n\nThe other three visitors drew their weapons as well, but Gavino put out a claw to stop them. "No, we've come to ask for a favor. Duke Geovanni of Bloodtalon sent us."\n\n"The Duke..." The griffon looked conflicted, his face contorting until he finally seemed to make an agreement with himself. "Fine," he spat out. "I will ask again; what do you want?"\n\n"What do you remember about the night our King Gumberto died?"\n\n"Ah, that night." The Imperial made his way over to a chair, sitting down in it as he remained staring intently at the Wingbardians. "If you believe that I know who killed your King, I don't. And even if I did at the time, the Empire had blocked even us from trying to look further into it out of curiosity. What I do remember was the food, though." He closed his eyes, apparently reliving the moment. "All the wines and exotic foods brought from the entire world! It was quite curious though, seeing the Skyfallians turn down all the wine that the Vinovians brought. Good stuff. Oh, and the Aquileians didn't have any Francistrian wine either. Something about refusing due to the poor quality."\n\nThe four agents looked at each other. "This information may come in handy," Gavino commented. "Thank you for your time, Baron Helheim."\n\n"Yes, yes, now get out! Stop hounding me, and tell Geovanni that I've settled my debt!""

 wingbardy_investigation.9.d:0 "It was known by most who had ever attended an event in Griffenheim that the Imperials kept records of the weapons confiscated and later returned. After all, allowing weapons at a social gathering was an easy path to courtly assassinations, and that would not reflect well on the Empire as a whole. That was why a majority of attendees had to undergo a search, and give up any sort of weapon for safekeeping until it was time to leave, when they would get it back.\n\nFinding the exact file for Grover's twelfth birthday was a bit difficult. The labeling had worn off over the decades, and the organization of the folders themselves were abysmal. Even when they eventually found it, SIM members had to then search though every document to find their suspects, and then find the weapons taken from them. But eventually it was done, and a full report of the information was laid out on Gavino Garritano's desk.\n\nBoth Erich Ebonwing and Marijke Redclaw had carried knives with them to the party. Marie Discret had not, choosing instead to take an old Vinovian revolver. Archon Eros VII was unfortunately not in the records, as a griffon of his standing was exempt from the rule and searches. While it may not have been everything they had hoped for, at least one of the suspects can be comfortably taken off the list."

The griffon who had spoken was young, most likely one of the newest members of the SIM. "Look at this."\n\nGavino was handed a single piece of paper, a note claw-written in confusing Griffish. "Well, what does it say?" he asked.\n\n"There's a lot in it. Apparently whoever wrote it just got a large sum of money from a location outside the Empire, and they are ordering the receiver of this letter to assassinate King Gumberto."\n\n"So they weren't working alone.\n\nThe agent nodded. "Not only that, but look at the corner here." Gavino squinted, focusing at where the other griffon was pointing his claw. "It's the Imperial Seal. Whoever got this letter must have really strong connections with the Empire."\n\n"So the Imperials are behind it once again..." Gavino gave a single nod of approval. "Excellent work, agent. I'll make sure to send this information to the King himself immediately.""

They examined every single word, double-checking every detail for a single thing that the Wingbardians didn't know, that could make a breakthrough in the case. Anything really that the Imperials could have kept hidden from them decades ago.\n\nBut as the final report reached Gavino Garritano's desk, the simple fact on the paper was that this was a dead end. Nothing in the report stating anything they didn't already know, such as how the murder weapon was a knife and that he died in King Garibald's talons. Even the basic facts told them nothing, as the Imperials had apparently been careful in keeping their own opinions about the former King out of the official document.\n\nAt the end of the day, nothing was gained."

But if he was wrong... well, best not to dwell on that now.\n\nThe King took a sniff of the alcohol before having a small sip from the glass. It was excellent wine, he had to admit that much. The griffons from Strawberry knew their craft well. But as he mentally matched the wine he was having to the one he smelled back then, they just didn't match. He had been wrong.

The King is sure that one of these four griffon committed the deed, but we must be very careful. Choosing the wrong griffon, or failing to get a conviction through a lack of evidence could at best make us look like fools and shut the case down, and at worst harm our relations and standing on the international stage.

Erich himself has stayed quiet on the matter, seemingly waiting for our response.\n\nMany are already saying to send him and be done with it. The murder of Gumberto is considered by many to be a major event contributing to the fall of the Empire, and if Ebonwing is behind it then the Wingbardians will punish him enough as it is for that. They also take this matter very seriously, and brushing off their demand would most likely not end well. Of course showing weakness to the Wingbardians is never a good thing, and refusing could help us save face, even if just a bit.

That was why he had assembled only his best griffons, the most talented agents in all the SIM. If they were going to pull this off, succeed at what their King has asked of them, then they would have to put in all their effort and then some to succeed.\n\nIt started just as any normal operation would. With the moon's light illuminating them, they broke into the Imperial Palace, quietly subduing any guards that they happened to come across. If they were trying to reach the current Emperor's room, that of Grover VI, they would have stood no chance. Fortunately, the room of the previous Emperor, that of Grover V, was now under significantly lower security. And none of the legendary Barkginian Guard, thank Boreas. Once they had reached the doorway, Gavino ordered the rest of the griffons to remain out guarding him while he personally searched through the belongings of the late Emperor.\n\nLooking through a dead griff's room was uncomfortable to say the least. It felt wrong to rummage through dusty drawers, look at old pictures with Grover V and his wife, or him and his son. For the first time he physically felt like an intruder, even with his sworn duty to serve Wingbardy. The sooner he found what he was looking for, the better.\n\nThe door creaked. "Hello?" Gavino whispered carefully, turning around towards the exit. "Is anyone there?"\n\nSuddenly the door burst open, and in rushed three imperial soldiers, all armed with rifles pointed straight at him. "Intruder!" their captain cried, "Surrender now or we will shoot!"\n\nSlowly, carefully, Gavino put his talons in the air."

With the moon's light illuminating them, they broke into the Imperial Palace, quietly subduing any guards that they happened to come across. At least the Regency's Chambers were fairly close; after all, they didn't want the nobles to have to walk too far into the palace to take their seats in important matters of governance. Once they had reached the great double doors, Gavino very quietly opened one of them and ushered his team inside before closing it behind them.\n\nThe chambers were very large, in fact one of the larger rooms in the entire palace. All the SIM agents fanned out, trying to cover the most ground in the least amount of time. Gavino himself made his way over to the little personal storage spaces, hoping to find something that looked old enough to be over thirty years ago.\n\nAnd find something he did. At the very back of an inlet within a desk, he found a dusty red book that was unmarked. Quickly flipping through it, a certain name quickly caught his eye within the pages. King Gumberto. As he scanned the particular page, his eyes widened. Holding the book up, he whispered to his fellow intruders, "I found it!".\n\nThe very next morning, the Palace Guard would be shocked to learn that while quite a few of them had been subdued, nothing of value had been stolen, and nogriff important was assassinated. But far away from the city of Griffenheim, the little red book that Gavino held contained all the evidence that they needed to know."

 wingbardy_investigation.31.t:0 "The Griffon Behind the Slaughter"
 wingbardy_investigation.31.d:0 "Usually when Gavino Garritano was awake at three in the morning it was because of a mission. This was a special exception. For he was not doing work on behalf of the SIM, no, this was just a personal favor that the King had asked him to undertake. The Regency Council, that accursed group of greedy, power-hungry griffons had gotten funding from somewhere. The letter from the council to Erich Ebonwing mentioned it, and the little red book confirmed it. The only question remaining was who or what was providing those idols.\n\nIt had been a long search. The journal's owner had been careful, making sure not to mention or cross out the names of anyone written in. It would have been impossible to do anything without the Imperial Mail Records they still had, which also contained notices of any large amounts of money or packages that entered and exited the Herzland. So by trial and error, a process of elimination, Gavino had gotten it down to a griffon from Skyfall. This particular merchant had planted the idea to kill King Gumberto in the first place, capitalizing on anger towards the loss of the Idol of Boreas of all things, suggesting that it was the Wingbardians' fault for the incident.\n\nGavino continued to dig deeper. Pulling out a massive folder from a filing cabinet nearby, he began to search through all the money and packages sent from Skyfall to the Empire during 972 and 973. As expected there was a lot, after all with Skyfall being the trading hub of the world there was many goods that flowed onward to Griffenheim itself. But there was a single order, under the claim of a "gift" to the Imperial government that had a suspiciously large amount of idols on the tag. And when the dates matched up with the ones on the red journal, Gavino knew he had found his griffon.\n\nThe one behind it all. The true creature who had set in motion the plot to kill the King of Wingbardy, Gumberto I. The griffon who started a chain reaction that would collapse the Empire into a shadow of its former self, causing wars upon wars on the Griffonian continent and by extension the deaths of countless creatures. All the while, he was growing rich off his gambit, a terrible yet brilliant chess move.\n\nThis griffon was..."

 wingbardy_investigation.32.d:0 "It was a bright and sunny day out as King Garibald Talonuel, third of his name stepped out into the royal gardens, a few birds chirping among the trees. Apt weather as well, at least for how the King was feeling. For the first time in his life since the loss of his father, since he had to take up the crown himself, Garibald finally felt... free. A heavy burden had been lifted off his shoulders, just from knowing the truth, and delivering justice to those who had escaped it for so long. His soul was bright, his mind at peace.\n\nSlowly, Garibald made his way towards the center of the courtyard, admiring the beautiful flowers that the Royal Gardener had so carefully cultivated. For years he had ignored the plants and animals, rushing by to take care of royal responsibilities that desperately needed his attention. But not today. He was taking today off.\n\nEventually he reached his target, the great stone statue at the center of all the trees. It was one of King Gumberto that he had commissioned not long after the murder. The age was starting to show on it, with a few cracks and a bit of moss in various places. He would have to get someone to clean it one of these days... But no matter. Slowly, he knelt before the great statue, putting a talon on the polished rock.\n\n"Father, I have done it," he whispered. "I finally brought justice to you. Ebonwing has been dealt with, the Regency Council is dead, and Guichard is gone. You can finally rest now." Lowering his head, Garibald let it rest on the stone base next to his talon. A single tear fell from his eyes, staining the otherwise pristine cobblestones beneath him.\n\nAfter a full minute, Garibald slowly got back up, and took one last look at the visage of his ancestor. "Goodbye," he said, almost silently. "I love you, father."\n\nAnd as the King of Wingbardy walked away, he swore he could hear a very faint "Thank you, my son," on the southern winds that would never cease to blow."

Maybe we could play them off against each other?\" Gaetano cautiously asked.\n\n\"We won't work with no stinking communists,\" Don Gorleone spat. The room went silent as he turned around and stood at the head of the table. \"The government is weak and ineffective. That's what gives us our power. The fascists and communists threaten to break that inefficiency and to go with one side or another is just inviting a stab in the back. We can only do what the rest of the nation is doing.

He looked out the side window and his blood froze. Grover Gori, the Iron Commissioner, stood there with a pleased smirk. Giovanni growled and slowly opened the door and put on a smile as he stepped into the street. \"I see you've got a new uniform, Grover.\"\n\n\"And you're still wearing those cheap suits, Giovanni,\" Grover said.\n\n\"I haven't done anything you can pin on me. Let me and my griffs go.\"\n\n\"Those were the old rules,\" Grover said with a smile. \"There's a new boss now.\" He nodded to two Blackwings next to him and a tarp fell from a market cart. A machine gun had been set up on it, manned by two Blackwings and sighted right at the car.\n\nFour hours later, Giovanni's body was dumped at gates of the Gorleone mansion.

He turned the window of his small government-issued apartment and peered out through the gaps of the tired old blinds. The warm rain gently tapped against the glass as he looked down at the dark street. Under a lamppost a single cart sat, inside sat a griffon reading a newspaper. He had been there for the last four hours and would be there for another two before, on the stroke of the hour, another car would come and take its place.\n\nGaetano wiped his forehead. It was a warm and humid night, and the small fan didn't provide much comfort. He turned and made his way to the bathroom and pulled up a floorboard under the sink. He breathed a sigh of relief when he saw the safe, he had smuggled in was still there. Things hadn't been the same since the commies confiscated their property, but the business was still doing the best it could in these dire times.\n\nHe lifted out the safe and entered the combination. It clicked open easily enough. He froze when he saw what was inside, or rather, what wasn't inside. His money, his extra ration coupons, his gun and ammo, family pictures, deeds and notes on the family business. All of it was gone.\n\nThe only thing in the safe was a single card with the CPAI badge on it."

 wingbardy_flavour.5.d:0 "It had been a few days since Prime Minister Ventriglio had briefed the Chamber of Deputies about the March on Karthin and the rallying of the blackwings. Although the head of government had promised action, the left wing of the Chamber decided to take matters into their own claws. In a side room of the parliament building, the unlikely alliance was ready to formalise. In attendance were the leader of the orthodox communist party, Antonino Proletarino, considered an extremist by the others leaders. Giovanni Gacci and Giacomo Gatteotti represented the revolutionary and reformist wings of the socialist party respectively. Gacci was a popular journalist and intellectual, who successfully brought many working class griffons outside of Wrobert into the socialist movement, while Gatteotti's unitary faction was a growing democratic faction in the party. Lastly, there was Guto Golajanni, representing the Republican Party of Wingbardy. His party was by far the smallest in attendance, but behind the aged criminologist's gentle features lay a fierce anti-fascist republican with important connections.\n\nAt the meeting, the gentlegriffs decided to form the National Liberation Committee and to evacuate Karthin with their parties. They would meet again in the port city of Wrobert, where the socialist movement was firmly established and where they would have little to fear from fascist agitators. Sympathetic officers would be contacted and socialist and republican organisations would be rallied and organised as best as possible. When the meeting was over, the air in the room felt heavy. The actions the griffons had committed themselves to were dangerous to their very persons, but they all knew that they had only one chance to stop fascism. Proletarino was the only one somewhat excited at the revolutionary plotting, while Golajanni seemed somewhat uneasy between the far left leaders. Gacci and Gatteotti, who could not stand each other normally, finally seemed in agreement, a reminder of the strength of a united Socialist Party."

 wingbardy_flavour.6.d:0 "The shadow of night hid four of the Red Guard's best shooters on the rooftops of Karthin's central district. Their rifles were pointed towards a well-lit building. It was a concrete insult to aesthetics tainting the otherwise ornate city-centre. The building was nicknamed 'The Monster' for its hideousness. It had been built after Wingbardian independence to hold arms for the royal army in case of a republican uprising. Now, the arms inside would topple the monarchy which commissioned it.\n\nAlmost simultaneously, four shots rang in the dark and four bodies dropped in front of the building. Below the sharpshooters, dozens of griffons wearing red bands emerged from basements, rushing towards the entrance. As surprised guards went outside to check on the gunfire, they were quickly mobbed and struck to the ground by the Red Guards, who used the opportunity to get inside of the Monster. Exactly five minutes later, a series of trucks ran up to the building, with the red guards who went inside returning with as many rifles and munitions as they could carry, the alarms blaring into the otherwise silent city. Before the carabinieri or the army arrived on the scene, the convoy of trucks was already racing out of the city, joining the rest of the Red Guard on their exodus of Karthin to the new revolutionary headquarter of Wrobert.\n\nNews of the successful raid on the Monster quickly spread through Wingbardy the next day, as an embarrassment for the government and the fascists, who planned to use those rifles themselves. The Red Guard also received a lot of recruits the following days, as many griffons sought to join the dashing brigades of the revolution, hoping to one day perform such heroic deeds themselves."

 wingbardy_flavour.7.d:0 "The Red Guard had been cursing and complaining when they heard of the plan to evacuate the Chamber of Deputies to save some bourgeois politicians. However, their mood changed for the better when they realised the building was surrounded by fascists, who were locked in a sort of quasi-siege with the carabinieri, who were dutifully protecting the deputies, their staff and their families inside the building. There was no way to do this in a subtle way, so the Red Guard rallied every member it had in the city and descended on the blackwings. The square in front of the Chamber became a massive brawl, claws clawing, clubs swinging and bricks and bottles flying through the air. This was the culmination of years of brawls in salons, on squares and other meeting places and all the pent up rage both sides felt. After a few minutes of violence, it appeared that the Red Guard had underestimated how many blackwings were already in the capital, as more and more fascists appeared. The situation looked helpless, until a cordon of heavily armed carabinieri descended from the steps of the Chamber.\n\nThe policegriffons started to systematically clear the square of blackwings, allowing the socialist militia to take care of their wounded and rush inside the chamber. Inside they found the Prime Minister, along with members of his party and the other liberals. Before the fascists could send reinforcements or the King could send the army after them, the Red Guard evacuated every griffon in the building out of Karthin. The escape of the liberal politicians and the bruised pride of the fascists shored up support for the democratic faction of the National Liberation Committee, with many deputies finally openly denouncing the imminent fascist coup."

It was a celebration of those who had fought and died for the Realm...And to Beakolini, it was his victory. The creation of a monument of war, and one to which many would be added. A grandiose ode to his intentions.\n\nThe many statues of heroes past, the oversized dimensions of the same. And an empty space, no doubt intended for Beakolini himself once he retired or died some day.\n\nAnd to everyone else, it resembled a giant typewriter, with only the need for a giant griff to come and cram a sheet of paper into it.\n\nBut none of the mattered to Beakolini.

 wingbardy_flavour.17.t:0 "On Colonialism & Imperialism"
 wingbardy_flavour.17.d:0 "A recently published book has caused a stir among the intellectuals of Wingbardy. It is called "On Colonialism & Imperialism" and was written by Griffancesco Grispi, a former prime minister and known advocate of Wingbardian expansionism. The tome discusses the natural predisposition of strong and advanced nations to subjugate weaker ones, but then questions how so many weak nations remained independent across the world.\n\nHe starts by focusing on Griffonia and its history, saying that while Grover I created a pan-griffon Empire, his son Grover II failed to conquer the weaker Riverlands. Although many historians claim the riverponies survived by banding together, he says the Griffonian Empire could've seized the Riverlands if they hadn't given up after Grover II's death. He explains that this did not happen because the Empire was already so vast that there was nothing to be gained from eastward expansion. He contrasts this with independent actors within smaller sub-states of the Empire launching colonial expeditions into Zebrica, as they had more of an economic motive to do so.\n\nHe then moves on to Equus, and immediately states that Equestria and its harmony is the main reason that allowed weaker nations on Equus to survive for so long. This he interprets more as a cautionary tale, because the weak changeling nations united into one, becoming a strong threat to Equestria. He says this could've been prevented if Equestria had simply subjugated the changelings.\n\nIn the third and longest chapter, he discusses Zebrica. He says it has many backwards nations, but how they are inaccessible due to difficult geography. In addition, the powerful nations of northern and western Zebrica are suspicious of foreign expansion, yet show little interest in expansionism themselves. Thus the "boundless riches of Zebrica" remained out of grasp for overseas powers. He mentions the Olenian viking conquest of Hindia as an example of the potential of expansion into Zebrica.\n\nIn the final chapter, he speaks of recent history, and how the fall of the Griffonian Empire and the rise of the Storm King changed the balance of power. Now Zebrica is weakened while nations such as Wingbardy are free to expand as much as they desire. He urges his fellow Wingbardians to take advantage of the situation before it is too late."

 news_wingbardy.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]For months, the right-wing journalist Giulio Beakolini has been clamouring for re-establishing order in the streets of Wingbardy's cities and in its government. His fascist party has garnered immense support, with many flocking to Beakolini's message of a restoration of the 'ancient Wingbardian order'. Many of these self-styled 'Blackwings' are former soldiers and veterans, providing the PNF with a substantial paramilitary force.\n\nMany moderates and socialists in the government were shocked to learn that King Garibald has no intention to stop a planned march on Karthin by the fascists. With government troops standing down, many in the capital nervously watch as thousands of black-clad fascists march towards them..."

The King spoke to a large crowd in Karthin, announcing Giulio Beakolini, leader of the far-right PNF, as Wingbardy's new Prime Minister.\n\nReplacing the previous Ventriglio government, Beakolini has formed a new cabinet, surprising most with the inclusion of socialist ministers, and has promised a swift end to the political deadlock.\n\nExperts are skeptical of his chances, but there is a certain sense of hope among the common Wingbardians. Perhaps the self-fashioned 'Duce' may bring about order."

 POLITICS_GARIBALD_TALONUEL_DESC:0 ""
 POLITICS_BEAKOLINI_DESC:0 "Giulio Beakolini was born to a middle class family in 954, and from early age, he had a deep interest in politics. His family's republican leanings made them ardent supporters of the Republican Revolution in Griffonia, and their eventual defeat did not weaken, but rather intensify, young Giulio's support for the cause, especially the more radical left branches of the movement. During his younger years, he worked as a journalist and became a famous firebrand within the left wing of Wingbardian politics.\n\nThe Falcorian war, however, turned into a watershed moment for the young Beakolini, and unlike most of his peer, he was in full support of the war. Through it, he saw the workers being empowered through the fighting and a chance to bring together a divided land. This led to him being ostracized as a warmongerer, and he ended up fired, being told he could go fight the war himself if he viewed it as something good. Beakolini chose to take the insult literally and joined the Wingbardian army, where his zeal and determination let him become part of the elite Wingbardian Bersaglieri.\n\nWhen peace came, he was a changed griff, and whereas many had been broken on the battlefield, he had found his purpose. He returned to writing, only this time for his own ideology, and ever since then, he has tirelessly written for and organized his own political movement; the 'Blackwings'. He has realized that republicanism is weak and corrupt, socialism a false idol that will break apart the nation. The new path forward organizes the entire nation as one entity, where all griffs are soldiers for Wingbardy's glory. He has named this movement Fascism, and under it, he will see Wingbardy rise to become the master of Griffonia, or die trying."
 POLITICS_ANTONINO_PROLETARINO:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd October 977\n\n§YBiography§!: Antonino Proletarino is a truly polarizing name on the Wingbardian left. Born to poor dockworkers in Wrobert, he grew up filled with hatred towards the wealthy who lived far better lives. When the Winter Revolution broke out in Severyana, he volunteered to join the army, and was awestruck by Steel Stallion's leadership. After Stallion's tragic death, he returned to Wingbardy and quickly rose to leadership of the nascent Partito Comunista Wingbardo. He is determined to remake Wingbardy into a glorious Workers' Empire. But known to almost no one are his secret lust for power and his desire to oppress those who once oppressed him. He knows this is wrong and against the spirit of Communism, but it's so very tempting...\n\nOnly time will tell if he will soften his stance, stay the course, or make Stallion look like a Harmonist."
 POLITICS_GALLO_VENTRIGLIO_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 16th November 946\n\n§YBiography§!:  Gallo Ventriglio graduated from the University of Talonin with a degree in law. He became a lawyer and solicitor and eventually entered politics, becoming a councillor and then mayor of the town of Plumerolo.\n\nWhen the Falcor War broke out, he joined anti-war movements and denounced the conflict that would claim the life of his son, Giovanni Ventriglio, who was shot down while on a bombing mission over Falcor.\n\nIn recent years, he was appointed Prime Minister after the collapse of the Gonomi government. His outspokenness against Beakolini's fascist movement has lead to many hoping for a quick crackdown of the Blackwings."
 POLITICS_LUIGI_GUTURZO_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 26th November 952 ALB, Gullagirone, Wingbardy\n\n§YBiography§!:  Born to a religious family in rural Wingbardy, Luigi Guturzo was destined to follow his family into the ranks of the ecclesiastics. He was ordained as a priest of Boreas in 975 and served as a teacher of philosophical and theological studies in his hometown, eventually getting a doctorate in the subject from the Archonical University of Karthin. While teaching in his hometown he got a first taste of politics where in 986 he became vice-mayor of Gullagirone, a position he would serve in until 990.\n\nHe was one of the founding members of the Partito Popolare Wingbardo in 990. In the party's first election it won 20% of the vote at 100 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, surprising many observers. The PPW quickly grew to be a colossal political force in the nation and it quickly found itself becoming the key for the formation of any government. However liberal and socialist parties were wary of it, seeing it as subservient to the Prelate of Karthin, and some even rumoured that it was loyal to the Archons and wished to return to the Empire. The latter was untrue however, as Luigi Guturzo would always believe in Wingbardian independence.\n\nHowever, Luigi Guturzo and the Prelate of Karthin where the two factors that led to the party's hard stance of never working with socialists. This is seen as one of the key contributing factors to the collapse of the Wingbardian political system. Luigi Guturzo is also staunchly anti-fascist and often speaks out against fascism, the PNF, and Giulio Beakolini.\n\nLuigi Guturzo likes to collect antique ceramic art during his spare time and often helps out with charity causes. He is respected and popular among the supporters of the PPW and is committed to building a better Wingbardy based on charity, compassion, and faith.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: MonAx"

 ### Traits ###
 WNG_oil_genius:0 "Administrative Genius"

 ### OLD FOCUSES ###
 ### FASCIST ###
 WNG_a_fascist_prime_minister:0 "A Fascist Prime Minister"
 WNG_a_fascist_prime_minister_desc:0 "The King has invited Beakolini to form a government as Prime Minister. Beakolini, after a moment of hesitation, has graciously accepted the position."
 WNG_trains_run_on_time:0 "Make the Trains Run on Time"
 WNG_trains_run_on_time_desc:0 "A tardy train is annoying, but a dozen late trains per day is economically unsustainable. By adopting new regulations based on incentives and punishments, we can maximise our railroad efficiency. This is, of course, something that even the common griffon will appreciate."
 WNG_crack_down_on_communists:0 "Crackdown on the Communists"
 WNG_crack_down_on_communists_desc:0 "We may have gained control of the cabinet, but we still have the issue of a dangerously polarised and militarised left. Beakolini and his ministers can pass legislation that will slowly curb the communists' powers. Prevention beats the cure, after all..."
 WNG_secure_parliament:0 "Secure the Parliament"
 WNG_secure_parliament_desc:0 "The communists have been taken care of, but our position isn't secure yet. We do not have a parliamentary majority, and the opposition could form a coalition against us. By introducing new majority policies, we can ensure full control over the parliament."
 WNG_education_reform:0 "Education Reform"
 WNG_education_reform_desc:0 "We must instigate new education policies focused on the glory of Wingbardy's past and how best the young griffons can dedicate themselves to making Wingbardy greater."
 WNG_news_censorship:0 "News Censorship"
 WNG_news_censorship_desc:0 "The newspapers often spread pro-communist rhetoric, harmful to the Wingbardian people. Il Duce, who has won awards for his truthful and honest journalism, is now able to ensure that only the truth is shared with the griffons of the nation."
 ### NEUTRAL-FASCIST DIPLO ### 
 WNG_subdue_old_allies:0 "Subdue Old Allies"
 WNG_subdue_old_allies_desc:0 "Talouse, Arantiga and Francistria all share cultural ties with Wingbardy. If we were to unite into a single state, we'd be the most powerful griffon state of the South. Let's make that into reality."
 WNG_reapproch_falcor:0 "Solidify Falcor"
 WNG_reapproch_falcor_desc:0 "The blood of over 460,000 Wingbardians was spilled in the Falcor War. While we did not start the war, through our might we brought the deceitful Falcorians to their knees. The city of Falcor was our prize. While Falcor was never truly defeated, more bloodshed is an unwelcome thought, but the city shall never be allowed to fall again."
 WNG_claim_the_throne:0 "Claim the Throne"
 WNG_claim_the_throne_desc:0 "The Empire has long since been a shadow of its former self, and an embarrassment to all of griffon Kind. Perhaps the only way to restore its ancient glory is to let a Southerner to take the throne."
 ### NEUTRAL-FASCIST INDUSTRY ###
 WNG_public_works_projects:0 "Public Works Projects"
 WNG_public_works_projects_desc:0 "With order now re-established, it is time for Wingbardy to deal with its underperforming economy. By subsidising national public works, we can immediately address the issue of unemployment. It'll take some time for the economy to recover fully, however."
 WNG_national_food_act:0 "National Food Act"
 WNG_national_food_act_desc:0 "Wingbardians may now have jobs, but they still lack food. If we can reinvigorate our own agriculture, we may be able to finally end this terrible famine and our dependence upon foreign exports."
 WNG_new_industrial_society:0 "Renewed Industries"
 WNG_new_industrial_society_desc:0 "Our economy is showing signs of recovery, but there is still much work to be done. With new investments to large corporations, our heavy industries will improve, as well as the overall economy of the country."
 ### Communist ###
 WNG_riots_in_the_streets:0 "Riots in the Streets"
 WNG_riots_in_the_streets_desc:0 "Beakolini and his Blackwings are brutes that will destroy this nation and oppress the common workers! We cannot stand for them to seize power from the rightful, if oppressive, government."
 WNG_griffons_liberation_army:0 "Griffons' Liberation Army"
 WNG_griffons_liberation_army_desc:0 "Griffons have always loved the call of battle. We should take after our fellow griffon comrades and build a new army of the proletariat for the benefit of all griffons and workers of the world."
 WNG_revolution:0 "Rivoluzione"
 WNG_revolution_desc:0 "Rise, griffons! Rise up against those who oppress you! Rise up against those who have lead this nation to ruin!"
 WNG_secure_the_griffons_republic:0 "Secure the Griffons' Republic"
 WNG_secure_the_griffons_republic_desc:0 "We may have many supporters behind us, but the factions within our new republic are fractured. They must be brought under the party's directive, politically or otherwise."
 WNG_rebuild_sociaty:0 "Rebuild Society"
 WNG_rebuild_sociaty_desc:0 "We have won the civil war, but our country lies shattered by it. By working with the remaining splinter parties, we can form a communist coalition and unify the left. Only then can we begin to heal the scars of war."
 WNG_rebuild_the_nation:0 "Rebuild the Nation"
 WNG_rebuild_the_nation_desc:0 "The war has ravaged what little was left of our nation's industries and infrastructure. Now we have a chance to rebuild a true communist nation, and show that Wingbardy can rise stronger from the ashes."
 WNG_workers_collectives:0 "Workers' Collectives"
 WNG_workers_collectives_desc:0 "The country's rampant unemployment must be tackled, and we can begin to do so by forming strong labour unions and farming communes. This societal reform will not repair the problem in the short term, but it will bring about many benefits in the meantime."
 WNG_communist_education:0 "Communist Education"
 WNG_communist_education_desc:0 "We must re-educate society to understand and follow true communist ideals. Never again shall anyone think of themselves as more than just a cog in the communist machine."
 WNG_mines_for_miners:0 "Mines for the Miners"
 WNG_mines_for_miners_desc:0 "The dangerous occupation of the miner is now no longer under the ownership of the uncaring corporation. Mining unions will require government support to get started, but they will improve working conditions, morale and, most importantly, productivity."
 WNG_farms_for_farmers:0 "Farms for the Farmers"
 WNG_farms_for_farmers_desc:0 "The farms are now in the talons of the farmers. We should help them form collectives to ensure that they manage their own work for the benefit of themselves and all of Wingbardy."
 WNG_factories_for_labourers:0 "Factories for the Labourers"
 WNG_factories_for_labourers_desc:0 "It has been a long time coming, but the industrial labourers are now in charge. With party support, they can establish their own work schedules and conditions to increase factory output."
 WNG_join_grw:0 "Approach the Eastern Revolutionaries"
 WNG_join_grw_desc:0 "Having fought hard to cast off the shackles of the old order, the [GRW.GetName] is perhaps the best example of a communist state and among one of the more powerful ones. With enemies on all sides, an alliance with the [GRW.GetName] will only be beneficial."
 WNG_free_the_bulls:0 "Liberate the Minotaurs"
 WNG_free_the_bulls_desc:0 "Asterion has long oppressed the labourers within its borders. We cannot stand idly any longer, and we shall install the rightful government, one way or another!"
 WNG_join_aquilia:0 "Join Aquileia"
 WNG_join_aquilia_desc:0 "Aquileia and its former autonomies have united into a socialist republic after a bloody revolution, and now stands to become the dominant power in the South-West. It would only make sense to approach them with offers of an alliance."
 WNG_divide_new_mareland:0 "Divide New Mareland"
 WNG_divide_new_mareland_desc:0 "The territories that are currently occupied by the colonial imperialists are rightfully Griffonian. We can reach to the local griffon populations and make them want for both Aquileian and Wingbardian rule. Out with the Equestrians!"
 WNG_our_own_way:0 "Forging our own Path"
 WNG_our_own_way_desc:0 "There is no one that we can rely upon to free the working class except for ourselves. Wingbardy shall lead the revolution in the continent and beyond!"
 WNG_free_aquilian_workers:0 "Free the Aquileian Workers"
 WNG_free_aquilian_workers_desc:0 "The Aquileian proletariat is being stifled by their government, and thus not allowed to flourish as it has in Wingbardy. There can be no negotiation with the Aquileian state; the only way to achieve the liberation of the Aquileian is by force of arms."
 WNG_pressure_the_colonies:0 "Liberate the Ponies"
 WNG_pressure_the_colonies_desc:0 "While some scoff at the idea of ponies being able to thrive under a socialist system, we cannot overlook the fact that griffons are under foreign rule. We're a peaceful nation, so we'll offer the Equestrians the choice: relinquish griffon lands, or face war."
 ### Neutral ###
 WNG_stop_the_march:0 "Stop the March"
 WNG_stop_the_march_desc:0 "Beakolini's march is madness: he threatens the very stability of the nation. We cannot allow his band of thugs to seize power of our great nation. The police and army remains loyal to the king, and they will stop the march by any means necessary."
 WNG_brake_the_political_deadlock:0 "Break the Political Deadlock"
 WNG_brake_the_political_deadlock_desc:0 "Enough is enough. It's time to end this political deadlock once and for all. The King will address parliament and demand that they produce results. Wingbardy needs leadership, and the King will provide it."
 WNG_conservatives:0 "A Conservative Government"
 WNG_conservatives_desc:0 "What Wingbardy needs is stability. The conservatives shall form a new government, and every measure will be taken to ensure that it succeeds."
 WNG_restore_order:0 "Restoration of Order"
 WNG_restore_order_desc:0 "The time for fighting is over. It is time to rebuild our nation and we will do so together. Everygriffon shall play their part in the new Wingbardy."
 WNG_royal_acadamy_of_science:0 "The Royal Academy of Science"
 WNG_royal_acadamy_of_science_desc:0 "The Royal Academy of Science has long being the dream of the King and many of the educated elite. Now that political stability has been restored, we can take time to set up such a prestigious institution for the benefit of all Wingbardians."
 WNG_the_free_south:0 "The Free South"
 WNG_the_free_south_desc:0 "Southern Griffonia is an ancient land with its own history and culture. Never again shall we bow to northern kings and emperors; the South shall always be free."
 WNG_balance_the_books:0 "Balance the Books"
 WNG_balance_the_books_desc:0 "With our economy in shambles we must review our budget and tax plans. The nation shall rebuild itself, one coin at a time."
 WNG_strengthen_the_king:0 "Strengthen the King"
 WNG_strengthen_the_king_desc:0 "Despite our progress, the King is growing impatient with its slow pace. By taking more authority and control over the government, much of the usual bureaucratic processes can be expedited."
 WNG_aluminium:0 "Royal Aluminium Company"
 WNG_aluminium_desc:0 "The Royal Aluminium Company is a government funded organisation tasked with increasing the nation's supplies of aluminium and other metals in order to help boost Wingbardy's industrial capabilities."
 WNG_wingbardy_forever:0 "Wingbardy Forever"

 ### Harmony ###
 WNG_librals:0 "Reinvigorate the Liberals"
 WNG_librals_desc:0 "The moderate left has often made its mark as a compromise between a conservative and a radical government. The King recognises the need for Wingbardy to start over, but will only step aside if the liberals do away with their more extreme ideas."
 WNG_embrace_harmony:0 "Embrace Harmony"
 WNG_embrace_harmony_desc:0 "Many of the PWd'A point to the stable country of Equestria over on Equus as a shining example of the concept of Harmony. Adopting a model similar to the Equestrians' may set Wingbardy on a path of restoring order."
 WNG_equestrian_aid:0 "Equestrian Aid"
 WNG_equestrian_aid_desc:0 "Having adopted Equestria's Harmonic form of government, we are in a good position to request aid from them. Being renowned for their bountiful food and giving disposition, it is highly likely Equestria will help us Wingbardians deal with the famine."
 WNG_pass_industrial_reforms:0 "Pass Industrial Reforms"
 WNG_pass_industrial_reforms_desc:0 "Now working with economic and social specialists that were traditionally left-wing, Wingbardian industry experts can set about to begin the long recovery from our economic and industrial stagnation."
 WNG_steel:0 "Privatise the Steel Industry"
 WNG_steel_desc:0 "In the past, steel and aluminium production had been government run, but have since been burdened by red tape. By allowing private companies to take over the mills with minimal government oversight, industry experts agree that our overall output will improve."
 WNG_equestrian_trade:0 "Equestrian Trade"
 WNG_equestrian_trade_desc:0 "With New Mareland as our neighbour, Wingbardy has an unique access to the Equestrian market overseas. It'd be foolish to not exploit this trade opportunity and improve our diplomatic standing with both Equestria and New Mareland."
 WNG_keep_our_friends_close:0 "Keep our Friends Close"
 WNG_keep_our_friends_close_desc:0 "With conflict intensifying abroad, Wingbardy cannot stand alone against our eventual foes. As such, we must reinforce our current alliance to ensure that we're not left alone. Even Falcor, our old enemy, may prove to be a useful ally."
 WNG_embrace_the_pony_way:0 "Embrace the Pony Way"
 WNG_embrace_the_pony_way_desc:0 "We have adopted so much from Equestria, why shouldn't we fully embrace their ways? Let the traditionalists and conservatives scoff at the idea - we know that ours is the only way to achieve true peace."
 
 WNG_school_for_gifted_griffons_desc:0 "Working with Equestria, we can establish a special academy in our nation that is inextricably linked to the famed Canterlot School for Gifted Unicorns. We may not have our own magic, but we have much to share with our pony kin as they do with us."
 WNG_harmony_with_griffon_characterises:0 "Harmony with Griffon Characteristics"
 WNG_harmony_with_griffon_characterises_desc:0 "We have striven to liken ourselves to the Equestrians, but there are hard, biological limits that makes our two species fundamentally different. There is a Griffonian spirit that cannot be suppressed and, as such, our version of Harmony must be adapted to it."
 
 WNG_mutual_support:0 "In Defence Of Harmony"
 WNG_mutual_support_desc:0 "There are those who are opposed to the ideals of harmony, brutish tyrants who wish to erase Equestria or Wingbardy from the map. They will learn to respect the power of friendship, as we shall aid one another as much as we can, despite the Celestial Sea separating us."
 
 WNG_arsenal_of_harmony:0 "Arsenal of Harmony"
 WNG_arsenal_of_harmony_desc:0 "With so much disharmony in the world, we cannot expect for things to be resolved peacefully. If Equestria won't step up, we shall be the ones to provide the arms to the righteous warriors fighting to achieve the peace that we're all after."
 WNG_cake_or_death:0 "Cake or Death"
 WNG_cake_or_death_desc:0 "It is clear that there are those who wish to sow the seeds of discord and watch the world burn. Wingbardians have always had good hearts, and we cannot abide those who purposefully seek to harm and destroy. We shall be the Blade of Harmony."

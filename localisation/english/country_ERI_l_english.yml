#### FOCUS

ERI_whats_next:0 "Ending The Stalemate"
ERI_whats_next_desc:0 "Ceasefire has been maintained for the past four years, despite several incidents. The good Duke believes that the time is right to make a change in the status quo, based on the recent information received. Our struggle simply cannot continue, something has to change."
ERI_war_of_course:0 "The Usual Method"
ERI_war_of_course_desc:0 "Might makes right! The only proper way to end the Verenian Struggle after all these years is by force of arms and valour of soldiers. The peasants will be mobilised for the cause, whether they like it or not! A decisive victory will ensure there is no more question about who is the rightful ruler."
ERI_peace_maybe:0 "Give Peace A Chance"
ERI_peace_maybe_desc:0 "Perhaps the choices we've made haven't been the smartest ones. If our soldiers and shells haven't been able to bypass the Aranti riverline defences for so long, alternative options should be considered. The charming Duke should be able to easily convince his rivals into an agreement that benefits him most."
ERI_enforce_levy:0 "Serve Your Duke"
ERI_enforce_levy_desc:0 "Slugs! Worms! The time has come again to throw our great might against that perpetual thorn in our side, Iovinus. As per their obligations, the peasants must be rallied to the cause, armed and equipped to the fullest. They shall support our knights in a glorious charge, and there better be no talk about rights again."
ERI_emergency_conversion:0 "Emergency Production Expansion"
ERI_emergency_conversion_desc:0 "Firearms! Ordnance! Shovels! The soldiers of House Erie always require more equipment for the war effort. Several non-vital production centres will have to be forcibly converted to fulfill these requests, and the Duke will tolerate no delays in the matter."
ERI_up_the_taxes:0 "Increase Noble Obligations"
ERI_up_the_taxes_desc:0 "The Duke isn't one for two-faced behaviour, which is why the nobles sworn to his banner should contribute further for his future great victory. Increased taxes, length of field service and required griffonpower drawn from their ranks are required if we are to claim Verenia in Vincent's name."
ERI_fund_fabrice:0 "Invest In Research"
ERI_fund_fabrice_desc:0 "Fabrice Assaultine, the Duke's Grand Inventor, is a griffon of brilliant thoughts, and he has provided us a great plenty in new technologies and reverse-engineered foreign designs. Surely, we should invest a portion of our yearly income to his private business, so that we may further benefit from his breakthroughs?"
ERI_fund_livio:0 "Expand Information Network"
ERI_fund_livio_desc:0 "Livio Sillègue, although despised by many for his deceptive methods, has been invaluable in unconvering numerous plots from House Eyrie. If it weren't for his eyes and ears, we wouldn't have been prepared for numerous feints and ambushes. If his activities received more coin, then we could count on clearer information in the future."
ERI_mobilise_economy:0 "Necessary Sacrifices"
ERI_mobilise_economy_desc:0 "Nogriff is pleased to do it, but the honest truth is that we must be more conservative with our already limited resources. As much as possible should be diverted towards supporting the war effort, with the knowledge of our complete control of Verenia being our guiding light and motivation for enduring this hardship. One day, it will all be worth it."
ERI_noble_oaths:0 "Rally The Bannergriffs"
ERI_noble_oaths_desc:0 "The Midnight Banner does not stand on its own: the Duke's most loyal followers come from the lesser noble houses, such as the Bonbolet, De La Framboise, Des Groseilles, Du Poivrier and others. Following feudal obligations, they must contribute their household knights in the next assault against House Eyrie, and the Duke will fulfill his side of the arrangement, as agreed."
ERI_approve_plan:0 "Knight-Commander's Course Of Action"
ERI_approve_plan_desc:0 "We haven't fought a war for decades without learning anything. The Duke's esteemed brother, Cyrille, Comte de Pont-aux-Griffes, has been working hard in hammering down a viable strategy that will allow us to break through the notoriously entrenched riverbank. There are no large scale fortifications owing to a lack of resources, yet the land is intensely difficult to advance through."
ERI_die_iovinus:0 "To End My Nemesis"
ERI_die_iovinus_desc:0 "The time is now! This is our moment of triumph! We shall march across the Aranti river and put an end to Iovinus' feeble schemes. Onwards to victory and glory, for the Duke! For Verenia!"
ERI_disarm:0 "Reducing Economic Mobilisation"
ERI_disarm_desc:0 "War creates much business, and it is great for innovation, but it certainly isn't good for the average griff who has to deal with a shortage of supplies and food. Restoring production to average consumer products should calm the masses, and show that their noble lords are most benevolent."
ERI_demobilise:0 "Sending The Soldiers Home"
ERI_demobilise_desc:0 "If we want to show that miser Iovinus that our intentions are genuine, then we must dismiss our forces from the payroll. Let the peasants return to their fields, and the foreign hirelings to return... to wherever they came from. If nothing else, the Duke's purse will get a lot heftier next month."
ERI_approach_for_negotiations:0 "Showing Sincerity"
ERI_approach_for_negotiations_desc:0 "The recent measures have certainly not gone unnoticed by House Eyrie, but the largest obstacle remains convincing them to attend the peace talks. It cannot be done through intermediaries - the two rival claimants must meet face to face if there is any hope of securing a lasting settlement."
ERI_plan_a:0 "Amicable Approach"
ERI_plan_a_desc:0 "Let bygones be bygones, yes? The Duke shall show his magnanimous side, forgive all past wrongs and slights, all for the benefit of peace. Surely, when faced with such abundant generosity, Iovinus will have no choice but to agree to everything we say? Vincent, you're so brilliant..."
ERI_plan_b:0 "Tepid Approach"
ERI_plan_b_desc:0 "There has been a lot of bad blood between Houses Erie and Eyrie. Nothing can change that, and nothing can bring back all the brave griffons who died for the cause. We've made the first move in extending a claw, but we expect Iovinus to show some good will and forgiveness of his own."
ERI_plan_c:0 "Aggressive Approach"
ERI_plan_c_desc:0 "Iovinus is but a weak, feeble minded simpleton. He's fallen right for my trap, and now we have him exactly where we wanted. A little blackmail here, and a little push there, and Verenia will be united with great amount of guile. I couldn't have thought of a better idea myself, and if Livio says it was his idea, he's lying!"
ERI_approach_avian:0 "Invite Katrina To Talks"
ERI_approach_avian_desc:0 "Who would have thought that the settlement process has gone far smoother than expected? A tentative agreement has been reached, but now we require the third party to join us. To complete the unification of Verenia, lady Katrina must attend our peace talks. Given her soft nature, she is very unlikely to reject the idea."
ERI_end_to_the_war:0 "To End The Struggle"
ERI_end_to_the_war_desc:0 "The most incredible outcome! Nogriff believed it, but Duke Vincent has managed to outmanoeuvre his competitors, with both House Eyrie and House Avian agreeing to accept his compromises. After all these years, Verenia shall be united, led by the most competent successor!"

ERI_we_fucked_up_again:0 "The Fifth Ceasefire"
ERI_we_fucked_up_again_desc:0 "Amidst the confusion, chaos and revolt - once more, we are forced to settle for the most ignoble outcome - a bitter return to "peace". What good is this peace when it won't bring back the griffons who died, or fix the damage caused by uprisings? There can be no half-measures past this point: the next assault is our death, or glory. The Duke will be taking a personal claw in the matter."

ERI_the_yale_connection:0 "Fabrice's Connections"
ERI_the_yale_connection_desc:0 "For all the vexations the Grand Inventor causes to Erie's nobility, it cannot be denied that his research produces actual results. Thus, it would be prudent to check if the latest funding from the Duke's purse resulted in some tangible benefit for House Erie, that would allow us to make amends for the most recent setback."
ERI_invite_old_colleagues:0 "Alumni Of Yale"
ERI_invite_old_colleagues_desc:0 "Brilliance often comes with a disparaging attitude for authority and norms, it would seem. Indeed, it's become somewhat of a trend to hear of promising graduates from the universities of Yale, who end up forced to work far beneath their capabilities for one reason or another. Fabrice has been wondering if some of these old colleagues could be invited here."
ERI_the_golden_mean:0 "Responsible Research"
ERI_the_golden_mean_desc:0 "The Duke holds great fondness for his Grand Inventor, but he realises that House Erie is on a tight budget. It would bring Verenia further glory to be the place of a new scientific revolution, but those are currently distant dreams. Fabrice will have to work with what can be spared."
ERI_no_limits_go_brrrrr:0 "Limits (And Ethics) Be Damned"
ERI_no_limits_go_brrrrr_desc:0 "Progress is a constant that is always sought after, yet never fully in reach. Why should we restrain ourselves in pursuit of victory? Anything and everything must be done to ensure we have an edge over our rivals. The Grand Inventor will have everything he desires, but there will be a strict deadline to ensure our investment comes to a satisfying conclusion."
ERI_tech_for_people:0 "Share The Progress"
ERI_tech_for_people_desc:0 "Who said we aren't generous overlords? Scientific discoveries are meant to be distributed far and wide, to inspire awe and fear! For now, we'll have to think a little smaller. Fabrice has taken a small break from his daydreaming, to write up a coherent program for teaching the masses. Of course, nothing dangerously thought provoking, just the basic things everygriff should know. Such as respecting your leaders."
ERI_licences:0 "Foreign Designs"
ERI_licences_desc:0 "Our goals would be far easier if the majority of arms dealers and banks across Griffonia didn't refuse to work with us. Boreas, it's not our fault we can't pay our debts on time, we're fighting a war! However, there is an alternative: bypassing private enterprises and working directly with a foreign government. There must be somegriff in the Aquileian heartland that will heed the plea of its distant relatives."
ERI_grand_experiment:0 "Spark Of Ingenuity"
ERI_grand_experiment_desc:0 "Numbers and strategies mean little when one side has a decisive technological advantage. Having worked for a long time on his most bold and audacious project thus far, the Grand Inventor has a proposal for the Duke that he'll find very difficult to refuse. Previous small scale demonstrations have been promising, now all that's needed is commitment and no small amount of resources."

ERI_indominable_spirit:0 "Hoist The Standard High"
ERI_indominable_spirit_desc:0 "The Midnight Banner has been bloodied, but not broken! We shall regroup, we shall come together, we shall never yield! Losses will be replaced, training shall resume in the earnest, the House of Erie shall fall only once when the last paladin perishes! Let us see to our preparations, lest our great Duke grows further displeased."
ERI_weed_out_the_weak:0 "Balancing The Needs"
ERI_weed_out_the_weak_desc:0 "Domestic economy is largely undefined and left to the whims of lesser nobles. As long as their estates and properties were managed sufficiently enough for the taxes, the Duke didn't really involve himself in the matter. However, this was always intended as a temporary measure until Verenia was united, and now we should make the first step in solving this problem."
ERI_bone_for_plebs:0 "Ease Up On The Peasants"
ERI_bone_for_plebs_desc:0 "The good people are tired of war and its endless provisions, which is all fair and fine, if we weren't pressed for every claw to our service. Recent instability, however, has shown that some wishes need to be fulfilled. For the time being, our gentler side will be shown to the masses, but we'll make up for the losses through other means."
ERI_fires_of_war:0 "Expand The Requirements"
ERI_fires_of_war_desc:0 "It. Is. Not. Enough. The good people may becry our choices, but no conflict was won through pleasant words and comfortable indulgences. Everygriff that can be pressed into some kind of service - they will be pressed, and hard! All unneeded frivolities shall be cut down upon, as well. The greatest force Verenia has ever seen will be brought through our sacrifice."
ERI_hedge_knights:0 "Wandering Soldiers"
ERI_hedge_knights_desc:0 "War isn't waged just for pride and prestige. Rather, some unscrupulous individuals fight for the thrill of battle, and the promise of payment. Such was the case when the old Empire broke, leaving many armed griffs without employment. Now, a band of these desperate stragglers make their way to the Court of Erie, seeking a patron willing to fill their pockets."
ERI_new_blood:0 "Fresh Recruits"
ERI_new_blood_desc:0 "They could not have been ready in time for the last assault, but the newest regiments have been trained to the standards set by our illustrious Knight-Commander. After a short ceremony for the newly minted paladins, they shall take their place among their comrades-in-arms. Hope they will be enough to overcome the difficult situation ahead of us."
ERI_relief_fund:0 "Carrot And Stick"
ERI_relief_fund_desc:0 "The virtues of nobility are exemplified by their treatment of the lesser and unfortunate classes. It is our humble obligation to provide for them, as they shall in return provide service and obedience. Should they act unruly, however, our generosity will have to be cut short. Let us hope they see the facts of life."
ERI_discipline:0 "Standards Of Paladins"
ERI_discipline_desc:0 "A paladin fights not only for their lord, but also their homeland, friends, families and more. Reminding our brave soldiers of their noble causes should inspire them to give their fullest effort in the coming battle. There can be no other choice."
ERI_ride_for_glory:0 "Bravery, Temerity, Dignity, Guide Us!"
ERI_ride_for_glory_desc:0 "A righteous cause is always worth fighting and dying for. A day may come when the bravery of griffon knights fails, but it is not this day. Embrace your closest, say goodbye to your children, for today, we march against immeasurable odds - and we shall be victorious! Advance against the world's ruin, for greatness has not yet perished, glory and courage! For our beautiful Verenia!"

ERI_cloak_and_dagger:0 "Livio's Machinations"
ERI_cloak_and_dagger_desc:0 "Nogriff really knows how far the spymaster's schemes go. Not even he is aware of every agent or criminal in his service, for he works through many proxies and intermediaries. Disorganised as it seems, it is ultimately to our benefit, as he is able to provide us with goods and information we couldn't seize through legitimate means."
ERI_expand_agency:0 "Increase Subterfuge Capabilities?"
ERI_expand_agency_desc:0 "The spymaster has been grumbling about his inadequate options concerning his role for quite some time. Livio is doing his work as best as he possibly can, but the few rooms given to him in the Château's east wing are reaching their limits. He has expressed a desire to have a more independent agency, suited for his needs."
ERI_infiltrate_the_hof:0 "Happy Little Accidents"
ERI_infiltrate_the_hof_desc:0 "A state consists of many parts, from its leader to the lowliest of clerks fetching paperwork. Far more than most realise, these "lowly" griffs are perhaps crucial to the wellbeing of a community, office or factory floor. If some of these were to disappear quietly, our infiltrators would have an easier time putting a wrench in their production plans."
ERI_sleepers_everywhere:0 "Revolutions Without Cause"
ERI_sleepers_everywhere_desc:0 "It is no secret that the peasantry has been griping about the conditions on both sides of the Aranti river. Why wouldn't they? Living conditions have steadily deteriorated over the years, trust in leadership has never been lower. Which is precisely what we can exploit to spread some unrest in Iovinus' holds."
ERI_among_the_people:0 "The Magnanimous Duke"
ERI_among_the_people_desc:0 "Sometimes, even great and wise leaders have to make appearances in public, to persuade their underlings that they ostensibly care about them. It is also an opportunity to lessen some wrongs, show a generous side, and much more! The question is, will the Duke deign to appear for the rabble, or will he rather stay at home?"
ERI_selective_destruction:0 "Misery Makes Great Company"
ERI_selective_destruction_desc:0 "Preparation is the most important part of any plan, and what better way to amplify our chances of success than to ruin theirs? Subverting House Eyrie at their every move will help out the ducal soldiers, especially when they notice that their foe has been waylaid, or greatly lacking in supplies."
ERI_the_job:0 "Most Dangerous Game"
ERI_the_job_desc:0 "For the past decades, war has been waged countless times, and uneasy peace followed each time, in a most vicious cycle of misery that's left both griffon and nature scarred. We have not fought to destroy Verenia, but to liberate it! The Ducal Spymaster has arranged through his contacts a most devious solution that will end the problem.\nPermanently."

ERI_duke_of_victory:0 "The Duke Of Victory"
ERI_duke_of_victory_desc:0 "By the Three above! At long last, the epic Struggle for Verenia has concluded, and it is our side that emerged triumphant! The banners of false claimants Eyrie and Avian have been cast to the ground, and we must make haste to ensure our hold on the region is secured. First order of priority: remind the subjects who's in charge now."

ERI_deal_with_katrina:0 "Amelinda's Heir"
ERI_deal_with_katrina_desc:0 "Unbeknownst to us all, Katrina has been overruled since her foolish attempt to broker peace between the Houses failed. Her supposedly loyal commanders have taken control of her holdings, and tried to seize Verenia while we were celebrating our success! They have been dealt with, but the question of what to do with her remains."
ERI_appease_peasants:0 "Distribute Amenities"
ERI_appease_peasants_desc:0 "The Struggle was never popular with the lower classes, that much is obvious, but our forces are stretched thin trying to quell riots and silly ideas of "communism". It seems that Iovinus and Katrina were also not that good at keeping the masses content, so to that end we'll show how great we are by giving them what they want: bread and entertainment."
ERI_loser_faggot_iovinus:0 "Seal Iovinus' Fate"
ERI_loser_faggot_iovinus_desc:0 "This particular vengeance has been a long time in making; the dastardly adversary has been caught and lies imprisoned in the dungeons, awaiting his rightful punishment. Although some have desired a public trial, Vincent has rebuked any and all ideas of such: he will personally decide what happens to Iovinus Eyrie."

ERI_praise_the_advisor:0 "The Duke's Most Favoured"
ERI_praise_the_advisor_desc:0 "Many can be praised for their contribution in ending the Struggle, but there is one griff who perhaps deserves the most praise of all. The Grand Duke is most generous to those who have served above and beyond their calling, and they shall be most handsomely rewarded for their efforts."

ERI_rebuilding_calembourg:0 "Rebuilding Verenia"
ERI_rebuilding_calembourg_desc:0 "Weep for our beautiful country! So despoiled and ruined after years and years of fighting. We must get to work and start reconstructing Verenia one brick at a time. We shall start from Calembourg, make it worthy of its epithet again, and from there, it shall spread to all corners of this land. The petty people shall know the benevolence of our Grand Duke!"
ERI_disband_militias:0 "Send The Peasants Home"
ERI_disband_militias_desc:0 "The war is over, and thus we have no more need for hastily raised peasant militias. Let them tend to their fields and families, and grant the most distinguished fighters some sort of reward, too. More importantly, we need to work on restoring the many verdant fields of gold Verenia is known for, so that everygriff can have a full plate on their tables."
ERI_solving_illiteracy:0 "Teaching The Populace Something Useful"
ERI_solving_illiteracy_desc:0 "There is no shortage of cheap, uneducated labour in Verenia, but their usage has its limits. Thus, the good-for-nothing subjects have to be taught some actual skills, like mathematics, management, and others, so that we may extract further benefits from the fruits of their efforts. Of course, it must be firmly established that the social structure is here to stay."
ERI_putting_eggheads_to_work:0 "So They Will Work Better For Us"
ERI_putting_eggheads_to_work_desc:0 "Anygriff can build a house; four walls, a ceiling and a roof. Good enough for a filthy peasant, but not good enough for the Grand Duke! We require our best architects and construction workers to build factories, housing, administrative complexes, anything needed, of high quality to last the test of time. Let the people feel pride as they see these aesthetic buildings."
ERI_cleaning_the_river:0 "Cleaning The Aranti Riverbanks"
ERI_cleaning_the_river_desc:0 "The grand Aranti, which has served Verenia so well in the past by giving us control of important trade routes, is in a less than desirable state. With so many trenches, wreckages, and decaying corpses on both sides of the river, it resembles something from the mind of Maar, rather than natural beauty. It needs to be restored, the land providing its bounty once more."
ERI_expanding_mines:0 "Exploit Verenian Riches"
ERI_expanding_mines_desc:0 "Most of the country is known for its flowing plains full of arable land, but the rather sparse rough terrain is surprisingly abundant in mineral goods. Prospectors were only able to discover and exploit a limited amount due to the single-minded focus on war, but now we have the means and options to fully explore what lies beneath the ground."
ERI_science_stuff_1:0 "Establish A Statewide Curriculum"
ERI_science_stuff_1_desc:0 "There are many things worth knowing in this world, but what exactly is worth learning is a matter of debate. Useful information, certainly, but it is up to us to decide what constitutes such and how it shall be taught among the masses. Most importantly, the evils of Marksism and Kemerskainism will be strictly kept out of any books in this country..."
ERI_increase_development:0 "Marvels Of Modern Times"
ERI_increase_development_desc:0 "Look back a century ago, and you wouldn't recognise how technology advanced. Automobiles, electricity, telephones, all those things have drastically changed the lives for griffons. Due to the expense required to produce specialised parts, their proliferation has been slow and restricted to the wealthy, but now we have the means and drive to change that."
ERI_improve_infra:0 "All Roads Lead To Calembourg"
ERI_improve_infra_desc:0 "Much can be said about the road quality in Verenia, and very few of it would be good. Lack of maintenance has led to severe infrastructure degradation, leading to them being barely suitable for a farmer's cart. To accomodate the transport of goods and materials, not to mention the increased usage of vehicles like automobiles and trucks, the roads must be fixed and expanded."
ERI_fix_railroads:0 "Repair Bridges And Railroads"
ERI_fix_railroads_desc:0 "Railways have been used extensively in the Struggle to move griffs and equipment, but every connection across the Aranti river has been destroyed for obvious reasons. Alongside the general disrepair of these links, it has become a pressing concern to repair them for civilian purposes. What better way to symbolise the unification of Verenia than building bridges?"
ERI_science_stuff_2:0 "Reopen The Calembourg University"
ERI_science_stuff_2_desc:0 "Calembourg is no Yale, but its learning institutions were the best Verenia could offer. Many were regrettably closed during the past decades due to conscription and slashed budgets, but now we have the means and responsibility to offer everygriff a place for advanced learning. Not only will it prevent further exodus of bright minds, but it will allow us to propagate proper thinking."
ERI_modern_verenia:0 "The Land We Can All Be Proud Of"
ERI_modern_verenia_desc:0 "While Verenia will never be on par with industrial giants such as Griffenheim, Aquila or even Skyfall, there is something that can be said about what we've accomplished in such a short time. The lowly complaints have mostly been silenced, and life is slowly returning to the good old days before 978. Yes, things shall be good from now on, peaceful and unchanging..."

ERI_dukes_favourite_egghead:0 "Fabrice's Brilliance"
ERI_dukes_favourite_egghead_desc:0 ""See, mon Duc? My doubters have decisively been proven as incorrect complainers, whereas I was the strong voice of reason. Without my brilliant invention, we'd still be stuck on the wrong side of the river! If you'd allow me, I have plenty of ideas and plans on how to make Verenia grand again...""
ERI_more_experiments:0 "Increasing Experiment Scopes"
ERI_more_experiments_desc:0 ""It's a shame science is so costly, but there can't be progress without sacrifice, you know? If you would be so kind to sign a few laws into power, and grant these funds, we'd catch up to the established powers in no time! I can't guarantee success in every venture, though. Innovation is a fickle business.""
ERI_avault_expansions:0 "An Avault In Every City"
ERI_avault_expansions_desc:0 ""Ateliers Avault is not exactly a business in the traditional sense of the word... alright, it is, but I don't bother too much with the paperwork and bills. I have griffs who take care of the uninteresting parts while I focus on what's most important. Still, expanding my venture across the river would increase the options at our disposal... May I count on some subsidies and 'volunteers' for a smoother growth cycle?""
ERI_the_nuclear_proposal:0 "The Atom And Its Potential"
ERI_the_nuclear_proposal_desc:0 ""Mon Duc, there are things around us that we cannot see. No, I'm not talking about spies. There are forces of nature, of such destructive power that anything we currently wield seem like gnats in comparison. This is a very costly endeavour, but there is something you might be very interested in having...""
ERI_noble_reward:0 "Rewarding A Friend And Colleague"
ERI_noble_reward_desc:0 ""When I came to Verenia all these years ago, I didn't think I'd be staying for very long. By that point, I've crossed over half of Griffonia, but I didn't expect myself to find such charming company, and not to mention all this encouragement for my craft. I'm not sure how to properly express my gratitude - yes, even the bookworm doesn't have an answer to everything, hah!""

ERI_spoils_of_war:0 "Distribute Eyrian Holdings"
ERI_spoils_of_war_desc:0 "Despite the Sunlight Shield being broken, most nobles under Iovinus have refused to serve the Grand Duke. Thus they've met their ignoble ends alongside their liege lord. The few who submitted will be allowed to keep their holdings, but the property of the dead will be granted to the noble houses who have loyally attended the Midnight Banner."
ERI_a_trip_to_france:0 "Our Aquileian Kin"
ERI_a_trip_to_france_desc:0 "Verenia is not alone in the world, in spite of what some say. Whereas previously most powers ignored the Struggle, now they must contend with the united region. Making foreign contacts is a beginning, but more importantly, we should find a protector. We hold much cultural and historical ties with Aquileia, making them a good starting point."
ERI_feudalism_for_today:0 "Modern Day Feudalism"
ERI_feudalism_for_today_desc:0 "The lessers serve their betters, this is how it always was, and always will be. Regardless of what some lunatics squatting in distant north say, nobility and stratification of society is here to stay. However, the system needs to adapt to changing circumstances, but to what degree it shall change remains to be seen."
ERI_pay_denbts_to_flowena:0 "[Root.GetPayDenbtsToFlowenaFocusName]"
ERI_pay_denbts_to_flowena_default:0 "Pay Debts To Flowena"
ERI_pay_denbts_to_flowena_alternate:0 "Fiscal Responsibility And Solvency"
ERI_pay_denbts_to_flowena_desc:0 "[Root.GetPayDenbtsToFlowenaFocusDesc]"
ERI_pay_denbts_to_flowena_default_desc:0 "In our efforts to seize Verenia, we've run up a considerable debt to the banks of Flowena, which has resulted in them refusing to deal with us. Worse yet, they've informed every other major and minor bank on the continent, leaving us with so little ways to gain capital. With so many riches seized, we can now afford to repay the debt. With interest."
ERI_pay_denbts_to_flowena_alternate_desc:0 "There has been considerable debate after our glorious victory what to do with the debt we've run up with Flowena over the years.\nNot anymore! The vulture bankers have gone bust and so have their ledgers. With that in mind, we have cut down on unnecessary expenditures, and soon we can trade with the wider world with confidence."
ERI_peace_in_our_time:0 "Promising Peace"
ERI_peace_in_our_time_desc:0 "Although the most recent war has mostly left cities and villages undamaged, the lowly people are still very much tired of fighting. As we have no claims beyond Verenia, and wish only to rule these lands in perpetuity, the Grand Duke has no qualms by promising the peasants that there will be peace in our time. There will still be a need for a defence force, though."
ERI_benevolent_autocracy:0 "The Role Of Nobles"
ERI_benevolent_autocracy_desc:0 "The Grand Duke has treated his subjects well, and they have been rewarded with new titles, holdings and other privileges for their boundless loyalty. However, now that there is less of a need for a constant war economy, life turning to the slow and uneventful day to day management of a nation, perhaps the old contract could be renegotiated to some extent."
ERI_looking_for_friends:0 "Look To The Périphérie"
ERI_looking_for_friends_desc:0 "Aquileia consisted of many lesser states, and today they are plentiful and varied, in an uneasy existence. One of the very few things they share in common is a staunch determination to remain independent from Aquila's taxes, nor do they desire to take orders from a Griffenheim despot. There is an opportunity we can exploit here, to bolster our own position at their expense."
ERI_the_superior_culture:0 "Savoir Vivre"
ERI_the_superior_culture_desc:0 "Living is a straightforward action, but knowing how to live properly is something that requires familiarity with the customs of a good society. It only seems proper that us benevolent overlords shall spread Aquileian culture east of the Aranti, but despite our flirtations with Aquileia, we must always remember we're Verenians first."

ERI_about_france_friendly_desc:0 "Boreas is truly merciful!

Let us hope their generosity extends further by offering us favourable terms."
ERI_about_france_unfriendly_desc:0 "Perhaps the republican rot has seeped into the minds of [JED.GetAdjective] leaders, as our recent emissaries and dignitaries have been repeatedly insulted and rebuffed on every opportunity, and not to mention the unsubtle threats thrown our way!

ERI_about_france_2_default_desc:0 "A single battle does not determine the outcome of a war. A grand victory on one field may cancel out a devastating defeat in a nearby forest, or it could go the other way. What's important is that we focus our sights on the larger picture, where giving up some ground could result in progression of our design."
ERI_about_france_2_friendly_desc:0 "Although the Aquileians are ruled by griffons of proper breeding and stock, they are not versed in how the Verenian forces operate. Exchanging officers and information should bridge the gap between our strategies, allowing us to perform in splendid harmony, against any would-be despoiler."
ERI_about_france_2_unfriendly_desc:0 "Over to the west, the Aquileians call this region Lointaineau, and they've made no secret that they wish to regain their wayward province. Verenia has not endured for centuries with its proud tradition of independence, and its unique culture, to bend to some despot again! They may come, but they will not leave."
ERI_ducal_bank:0 "Independent Banking"
ERI_ducal_bank_desc:0 "The issues we've had with Flowena and other banks has showcased that Verenia needs a certain degree of financial independence. The Grand Duke shall select a trustworthy griff to manage the newly established bank, partially funded by him, but the most important thing is that no traitorous merchants will ever have a claw again in causing a rebellion."
ERI_art_galleries:0 "A Match Made For The Grand Duke"
ERI_art_galleries_desc:0 "It is well known that our wonderful ruler has no significant other, leaving the future of the ruling house somewhat uncertain.

ERI_verenian_legacy:0 "Our Tradition Secured"
ERI_verenian_legacy_desc:0 "Ever since Kalem descended from the Hyperborean Mountains, who else can claim a longer history than Verenia? Certainly not any would-be pretender or invader!

ERI_improving_subterfuge:0 "Expand Undercover Operations"
ERI_improving_subterfuge_desc:0 ""You sure love keeping me and my operations busy, huh? The deal remains unchanged: you provide the funding, I get my griffs to find more griffs to snoop around for us. It's going to be a lot more complicated keeping track of what goes on beyond Verenia... and a lot more expensive, too. Perhaps we should steal some idols, as well.""
ERI_rigging_the_odds:0 "Planting Agents"
ERI_rigging_the_odds_desc:0 ""The claw of deceit stretches long. If you have a griff on your side in an unfavourable situation, you end up achieving much with a few soft words, whispers in the dark.

ERI_making_a_military:0 "Reforming The Verenian Guard"
ERI_making_a_military_desc:0 "When Verenia was whole, it had its Guard. It was not the most successful or notable of forces, but it kept the people safe and our holdings protected. Currently, our regiments are disorganised, cobbled together from griffs of varying quality. If Verenia is to be defended, standardisation and reorganisation is sorely needed."
ERI_doctrinal_choice:0 "Force Specialisation"
ERI_doctrinal_choice_desc:0 "Technology changes warfare, and a griff would scarcely be able to compare a hundred years ago to today. One used to have to look somegriff in the eye to kill them; now it is slowly becoming more and more distant and impersonal. This cannot be mitigated, but rather we should determine forward the method our armed forces will conduct themselves in the field."
ERI_ducal_armouries:0 "Repair Damaged Factories"
ERI_ducal_armouries_desc:0 "Much has been peacefully seized in the process of reunifying Verenia, but there are plenty of armouries and workshops that suffered looting and destruction during the last war.

ERI_praise_the_heroes_desc:0 "So many have died. So many, but it was all dutifully recorded and preserved, that even the lowliest of peasants are remembered. Was it all worth it? For those who remain, it was worth all the blood and sacrifice. Let us commemorate the fallen and celebrate the living, so that we may all continue to be better, and avoid a repeat of the Struggle."
ERI_paladin_improvements:0 "The Knight-Enchanters"
ERI_paladin_improvements_desc:0 "Enchanting is a proud griffon tradition, and it is certain that industrial advances have allowed us to apply them on a large scale, but something gets lost in this mass production. Some paladins are known to experiment with enchantments themselves, with promising results. They should be allowed a distinct rank within the chapters."
ERI_better_rifles:0 "Continued Infantry Weapon Improvements"
ERI_better_rifles_desc:0 "Owing to what could be described as an foreign embargo, the firearm of choice during the Struggle has greatly varied from soldier to soldier. Whereas the workshops struggled to supply the troops with the latest rifle models, many had to do with an older design, or in some cases, pikes and muskets. With the industrial might of Verenia turned to a single purpose, everygriff will have the best weapon we can provide."
ERI_planning_redoubts:0 "To Plan A Redoubt"
ERI_planning_redoubts_desc:0 "There is a world beyond Verenia, and it may not look favourably upon it. The Aranti riverline is no longer the ultimate defensive point we could rally around, and an attack could come from any direction. While this land is sparse in rough terrain that provides ideal places for fortifications, we can still scrounge up a plan to bolster our defences... from one direction."
ERI_fancy_ordnance:0 "The Ducal Artillery Company"
ERI_fancy_ordnance_desc:0 "Current estimation predicts any future war in Verenia will be a defensive one, and our geography mostly consists of plains. Thus it is ideal to stockpile on ordnance and train griffs in their effective usage, to make any invader dearly pay if they want to take our land. Strategic areas will have to be firmly defended to allow the artillery its full effectiveness."
ERI_support_research:0 "Support In The Field"
ERI_support_research_desc:0 "One griff can achieve plenty, but two griffs can accomplish twice as much, this is certain. Warfare has changed and no longer relies on individual bravery, but closely knit forces that rely on each other to achieve success in the field. Our forces could use many more engineers, scouts, field medics, and others, but they require specialised training first."
ERI_forming_air_force:0 "Formation Of The Verenian Air Corps"
ERI_forming_air_force_desc:0 "Airplanes have seen very limited usage during the Struggle, as limited resources precluded their mass production, but their benefits and possibilities are more than apparent. Pilots, airfields, designs, all these and more are required if we could even dream of competing with more powerful rivals."
ERI_log_mot:0 "Logistics And Getting Things Around"
ERI_log_mot_desc:0 "While many nobles like the idea of having griffs drag objects around, it is not quite an efficient method of transportation. Technological progress is inevitable in many cases, and having dedicated companies and even vehicles for transporting supplies would do wonders in alleviating future concerns on the matter."
ERI_verenian_guard:0 "The Guard Stands Proud"
ERI_verenian_guard_desc:0 "Storm clouds gather over Griffonia, but Verenia shall not be rebuffed by them! Not with its rebuild and reorganised Guard, dedicated to protecting all that is good and proper, such as tradition, nobility and exploitation!

ERI_focus_on_elites:0 "Expand The Order Holdings"
ERI_focus_on_elites_desc:0 ""Mon Duc, you must understand. The order needs additional holdings so we can train our new paladins more effectively.

With your permission, we can begin putting aside land that will be used to build new chapter keeps.""

ERI_new_training_program_desc:0 ""It's almost a shame the war has ended, yes? Why, I never felt more alive than on the battlefield! Nonetheless, much has been learned and the paladins will ensure all this knowledge will be drilled into new recruits. There may yet be another battle soon enough.""

ERI_fabrice_postwar_txt:0 "Very few griffs at the Ducal Court were surprised to learn that Fabrice Assaultine has crawled his way to the top, and how could he not? In spite of the friendship between him and Vincent, the Grand Inventor has provided the means that decisively ended the Struggle once and for all. It is only a minor consolation for the nobles that Fabrice does not exploit his standing... too much.\n\nThe Grand Inventor's primary interest remains the expansion and improvement of all things scientific, but now he has also been placed in an unofficial position as the land's industrial developer. Whether anygriff likes it or not, Verenia shall be dragged to a modern age, full of factories churning smoke and mines overflowing with resources."

ERI_cyrille_postwar_txt:0 "Having secured his brother's favour at the expense of others, Cyrille now has a free claw in molding the newly reunified Verenia to his pious vision. Although the Grand Duke will rarely show familial affection, he will nonetheless approve whatever the Paladin-Commandant deems necessary, even as the other nobles gripe at the "unnecessary" expenses.\n\nThe Comte de Pont-aux-Griffes's primary interest is in expanding the armed forces, reaffirming the people's devotion to the Three and helping out the downtrodden. He does not particularly concern himself with other aspects of nation building, but there is no doubt Verenia will be seeing a substantial increase of the paladin chapters' ranks."

ERI_establish_commandery:0 "Dedicate Castle To The Order"
ERI_establish_commandery_desc:0 "Before the Struggle broke Verenia in half, the Paladin Order had many holdings and keeps across the land. Most were lost when the majority of paladins rightfully defected to serve the Grand Duke, and some were abandoned to reduce the upkeep cost for an already strained budget. We now have the means and griffonpower to restore their rightful properties."
ERI_establish_demesne:0 "Establish Local Outpost"

ERI_cyrille_slot_desc:0 "There is a need for an institution that educates soldiers in more advanced aspects of warfare, not just in the theory of tactics. Indeed, there are only so many paladins available to teach our officers and recruits. Though some may bemoan the supposed debasing of our traditions, sometimes we simply have to adapt to changing times."

ERI_livio_postwar:0 "The Ducal Spymaster's Devious Design"
ERI_livio_postwar_txt:0 "Truly a victory for the dark griffon! Despite several setbacks, Livio has convinced the Grand Duke of his value and he has in return provided the spymaster with favour and protection. The others can gripe and complain as much as they desire, but they have only shown themselves to be incompetent, and the Grand Duke has no interest in hearing the details of such.\n\nThe Ducal Spymaster's primary interest are clandestine acts of subterfuge. Nothing is too sacred, no method is too heinous to consider. If Verenia cannot get ahead of its rivals fairly, it shall do so in an underclawed way."
ERI_immigration_campaign:0 "Loosen Immigration Standards"
ERI_immigration_campaign_desc:0 "In a distant point of centuries past, Verenia was one of the most populous regions of the Griffonian Empire. Today this is obviously not the case anymore, with the Struggle causing many to emigrate in search of better life, but at least we're still more civilised than the far marches of the east. This could be corrected by attracting griffons to make their livelihoods here (there are, after all, plenty of empty homes), and giving a blind eye to the more shadier types."

ERI_war_plan_B_idea:0 "Expédition Couleuvre"
ERI_war_plan_B_idea_desc:0 "Cyrille has drawn up a most daring plan: Lake Rumare has been mostly ignored during the Struggle as no side has the capabilities to produce effective naval vessels, not to mention any would be entirely useless due to the fact that it has no exits to the sea.

ERI_herz_marriage:0 "Anne Hotz"
ERI_herz_marriage_desc:0 "The Hotz family was well regarded in the Imperial Court — before 978 — but has not received the same treatment in Verenia since then.

Additionally, she has some skill with mathematics, having helped optimise local production processes for a greater return on investment."

It is noted that without his brilliant tactical leadership, House Erie would have long perished, and it is thanks to Cyrille that the cities of Pont-aux-Griffes and Erie resisted three sieges over the course of ten years. The tale many recount at outings is one at the second siege of Pont-aux-Griffes, where the Comte held the bridge with a small group of paladins against a vastly superior Eyrian force.\n\nIn spite of his almost legendary exploits, Cyrille remains unclouded from delusions of grandeur. His sole commitment remains the furthering the cause of his liege lord, distancing himself from the politicking and schemes in the Ducal Court. When it comes to management and paperwork, Cyrille usually delegates the responsibility, preferring to concentrate on his training and reading stories of both historical and fictional knights. Regardless of his immense propaganda value, the Comte continues to charge headlong into the next battle, leaving the troops under his command to wonder if he has a suppressed death wish, or simply vicious bloodthirsty tendencies.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!: KaiserSauce"

Such was the case with Livio Sillègue - coming from a family of vintners who made good trading in Vinovia. In a happy tale, they would have prospered and remained satisfied, if not for an ultimately unfortunate trip to the Périphérie in pursuit of a market expansion. Caught in the revolution's outbreak, they were targetted by insurgents mistaking them for nobles due to their opulent outlook. Livio was the only one who survived the massacre. Clawing his way out of the caravan with little more than his clothing and a few idols, he was not seen or heard for many years.\n\nIt is unknown what he did to survive, but Livio would eventually find himself locked in Château Erie's deepest dungeons, wanted for several charges of murder, arson, robbery and other heinous crimes. Execution was certain, if not for an offer from Vincent himself: put his underground connections to the cause of House Erie, or face oblivion. It was an open secret that Livio was hunting down the perpetrators of the worst day in his life, and to that end, he became quite skilled in collecting information (though he mostly used it for satisfying violent outbursts). Unwilling to forsake his revenge, he would take on the Duke's offer, much to the dismay of his fellow courtiers, forced to put up with a criminal only barely adhering to the proper decorum.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!: MonAx"

After Cyrille was promoted to Knight-Commander at a remarkably young age compared to previous title holders, he claw picked the best of the best, which he personally leads on the battlefield.

This company led the final charge to the last holdouts, butchering many insurgents as well as innocents, giving them a decisively unflattering reputation for brutality. Even though its captain has been reprimanded and demoted for going too far, memories of the event remain burned inside. Knight-Commander Cyrille has given the accolade of leading this company to a most promising recruit, hoping to curb the poor reputation unbecoming of true paladins.\n"

This cadet branch of House Eyrie would become known as House Erie over the years. The two branches co-existed in relative peace until the revolution of 978.\n\nThe most senior member of House Erie left after the Republicans butchered most of his family, Vincent seemingly embodies the traditional noble qualities which led to such dissatisfaction: arrogance, hedonism and scant concern for his servants. This is not helped further by the fact that he has rebelled against the established order of succession, which states that House Eyrie has priority for the Verenian throne. But those close to Vincent would confirm his eloquence and learned mind, exceptional generosity to griffons who have served him well, and above all, an unshakeable desire to see Verenia flourish like in the times of old. Some even say that he can be very charming when it suits him, though Vincent has yet to secure marriage even after he passed 50 years of age.

Vincent Erie, the true heir of his father's legacy, has ousted his rivals and united the realm under his ironclawed rule. To mark this unprecedented moment where a cadet house has overthrown its senior house, he has broken with tradition and taken the mantle of grand duke, something past rulers have never claimed even at Verenia's furthest expansion.\n\nBut not all is as Vincent would like. Though the Struggle has ended, the problems that wrapped themselves around Verenia have scarcely vanished. The nobles scheme, the peasants gripe, and the other major powers look at his realm like a particularly delectable éclair. Now is the time for a true leader to prove their worth, or be swept aside like many others before. It remains to be seen whether Vincent will step up to the task.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kleowolfy"

He has begun to style himself as greater than the Discrets ever were, building further monuments to his legacy, and even rewriting history. It can be excused, for at least he has generously shared the spoils of his conquests with both his retainers and the commongriffs. Surely, he won't let this get to his head too much and let the sizeable realm break apart? One can never tell with Vincent's fondness for ennui.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kleowolfy"

Green and rash, he would prefer to learn directly from experience than heeding his tutors and teachings, before ultimately relenting that he is not at all suited for the task.

He fully expected to die in the uprising, but now he has to learn the hard way that nation building is not quite like harvesting his crops.

#### EVENTS

erie.1.t:0 "An Introduction To A Sordid Tale"
erie.1.d:0 "My name is Vincent, the true duke of Verenia. For decades, I've waged a war of unmatched ferocity and fervour over these lands against my accursed half-brother, Iovinus, the false duke. In the past, our ancestors have ruled Verenia and its lush plains, lucrative river trade routes and splendid cities, whose grandeur only increased after we swore fealty to the rising Groverian Empire. However, everything changed after those filthy, uppity revolutionaries tore through the region, and left most of my family hanging on trees, including poor father. With the line of succession unclear, and my vacuous brother unwilling to submit, there was no choice but to fight for the title.\n\nAlas, victory was within my grasp, if it weren't for that trollop Amelinda, who absconded with a sizeable portion of my property and soldiers. The endless stalemate developed, and Verenia fell behind in terms of development and population. Indeed, I've even heard that in distant corners of Griffonia, they make jokes of two dunderhead dukes fighting over worthless rocks. To this I say, nay! They do not realise the beauty of this land, which I dearly love with all my heart. I'd love nothing more to see it restored to what it once was, even if in the end I'm forced to submit to some other rising tyrant.\n\nFortunately, my few and faithful retainers (the same cannot be said about the worthless peasants who keep complaining) work tirelessly in achieving the noble goal. Alongside the noble families who are sworn to the Erian Midnight Banner, the most notable griffons in this House are my biological younger brother Cyrille (who in spite of his ridiculous behaviour, is a very brave and capable commander), a brilliant mind named Fabrice (provides me with new inventions and drinking company on weekends) and Livio, the court rat (his schemes have not always produced the required information, but he is too valuable to dispose of).\n\nThese are my means, and I shall stop at nothing to achieve my rightful claim to the throne."
erie.1.a:0 "Let us finish this, once and for all."

erie.2.t:0 "Cyrille's Grand Plan"
erie.2.d:0 ""To conclude, gentlegriffs, our strategy concerns itself primarily with the capture of fortress Eyrie. Paladins will lead multiple assaults over the riverfront, with concentrated artillery strikes at their weakest defences, while I shall hold the elite knights in reserve, ready to strike once their soldiers move to support northward. With the capture of their main fortification, nothing shall stand in our way to force them in a most inglorious surrender." Peered over an extensive map of the Aranti river, Knight-Commander Cyrille of the Erian Household Guard and the Order of the Proud Ones of the Triarchy finished his proposal. "Are there any questions?"\n\nShuffling in their chairs, his subordinates, as well as his liege lord, Vincent of Erie, seemed satisfied with the proposal. Lacking other options, everygriff wanted nothing more that a swift conclusion to the decades of warfare - in their favour, of course. Yet doubting thoughts did not yield so easily, as one of the paladins spoke.\n\n"The ruse is too obvious, they won't weaken their defence lynchpin, even if we committed entirely. Iovinus gains nothing from moving off that hill, and might simply launch his own counterattack once we broke through the riverline. And what of Lady Katrina? Will she stand idly once again, or has she plotted something nefarious?"\n\nJust so, the illusion of confidence cracked. Nogriff wanted another folly from 3 years ago. Much has been invested since that time, in both research and information gathering, and who could say how much more could the status quo endure? Options were weighted, forces were adjusted, and in the end, an effective compromise was reached.\n\nAs always, it would just have to do. Honour and duty demanded it."
erie.2.a:0 "We hold faith in the valour of our soldiers, and the skill of our leaders."

erie.3.t:0 "Yet Another Setback"
erie.3.d:0 "This was going to be the day. This was it! The culmination of his efforts and desires! Vincent Erie would have his vengeance, and all of Verenia would finally be his. Confidently strutting in his workroom, the only thing left to do was await the arrival of an herald proclaiming victory.\n\nAnd not a moment too soon, there was already a knock on the door, followed by a frightened looking messenger carrying multiple envelopes. "Ah, servant! Has the battle gone well? Is that cur Iovinus finally in a cage where he belongs? Give me the news now!" Alas, the retainer was too cowed by his superior leadership skills and could only meekly deliver his missives. Wasting little time, the Duke tore off seals from letters and began reading.\n\n"Peasant riots... front in disarray... full retreat ordered... truce declared?!"\n\nThe shocking turnabout was too much for the Duke to handle, furiously throwing the papers into the fireplace, followed by slamming his claws on his prized mahogany table. This could not stand. He has waged an epic campaign of warfare and leisure, and his idiotic, pathetic excuse of a brother refused to give in! There could be no more half-measures. Remembering that the peasant griffon was still sharing his quarters, he issued a quick and imposing bark, as befitting a griffon of his stature and authority:\n\n"Servant! Bring everygriff who matters to these chambers, now."\n"W-which ones, my liege?"\nOh how the Duke hated incompetence. "Every. Single. One. The Knight-Commander, the Spymaster, the Grand Inventor, the paladins in the field who aren't dead or dying, anygriff who does something in the court! Now get moving before I cut your wages!"\nSatisfied that his unquestionable supremacy sent the lowly servant to a dart, Vincent moved to his comfortable resting chair to formulate the next course of action. And of course, the scoldings he would give to his underlings."
erie.3.a:0 ""Can't anygriff do anything right?!""

erie.4.t:0 "The Faults In Our Actions"
erie.4.d:0 ""Well, everygriff? All of you have assured me that we were prepared, that this time for sure, House Eyrie would be trampled under our assault. Yet, we are undone because of what, a few peasant riots? I hope there's a very good explanation for this."\nJust like that, murmurs ceased, replaced with an uncomfortable silence, only interrupted by the ticking of an imported Macawian clock. It would have gone on for quite some time, if the bold knight didn't step in to the fray.\n\n"My liege, please, do not blame your brave soldiers. We all fought gloriously, spurred on by a righteous cause, but we were undermined by circumstances not within our control. Namely, the rat Livio provided us with faulty information! Pluck his feathers and flog him!"\nAmusing how the supposed icon of chivalry didn't see himself above passing the guilt, and with that, the cacophony was released.\n"My fault? It's not my fault your featherbrain can't read simple reports! Maybe you should slam your head on the wall less!"\n"House Bonbolet was always your favourite, my lord! Please forgive us!"\n"I say we teach the peasants a lesson! Torch their houses and fields!"\n"Does anygriff have spare bandages?! I beg you, Lothaire got shot in the wing!"\n"Fools! While you argue like ponies, Iovinus only gains! It won't be long before he burns down Château Erie!"\n\nSpoiled, insipid children. Vincent had to act before it came to blows and scrapes. With a mighty bellow that silenced the lesser underlings, he would cow them all into submission.\n"I do not care whose fault is it, because it is clear and obvious, all of you have failed in some manner. You will return to your posts, fix your egregious mistakes, and then we can do this properly. By Eyr, we've been stuck at this for over 30 years, you'd think we'd accomplish something right by this point. Now...""

erie.5.t:0 "Workshop Of Wonders"
erie.5.d:0 "The sting of failure still lingered in Vincent's mind, but it was best not to dwell on it for too long. After all, he spent the previous two days indulging in the contents of his wine cellar, where a particular Francistrian vintage caught his attention. Now, the time is right to get back to work, and pay a visit to his most trusted servants. Taking a more personal claw in the matter will ensure nothing's left to chance next time.\n\nMilling through the streets of Erie, Vincent would make his way to the local branch of Ateliers Avault. No doubt, Fabrice was well on his way towards discovering an ingenious weapon that would smite Iovinus to scorching pieces! Or more likely, nursing a hangover from last night.\n\nWhat he didn't expect, as he entered into the workshop's main hall, was an arc of lightning striking not even an claw's length away from him! Vincent briefly felt his life instantly passing over his eyes, with a scattered prayer to Eyr, until his stupor was interrupted by the familiar smooth voice, slowly gaining in closeness.\n\n"Apologies, mon Duc! What you've just witnessed is my latest and greatest creation! It came onto me in a dream, no doubt granted by Boreas Himself! Still a work in progress, though..."\n"Aaaaaaah... Fabrice! What have I told you about safety measures? I could have been seriously hurt!"\nIf the brilliant inventor seemed phased, he didn't quite show it. "Nonsense, friend! I'm not much for medical science, but I'm sure I would have been able to treat any... non-serious wounds. That's the best I could promise. Now then, what is the purpose of my Duke's visit to this humble shrine of science? It's far too early for leisure, is it not?"\nOh yes, Vincent would have loved some casual games accompanied by imported Skyfall whiskey and cigars. But later on that, this time he meant business. "Not now, Fabrice, but I do have something most excellent to show you for that time. I'm here to discuss our immediate plans for House Erie and how your work should fit into it. May we speak in privately?"\nInstructing his workers to take care of the machinery, the loyal servant would guide his employer through the maze-like hallways. "I was certain we would triumph this time, but fortune did not favour us. I've been working on something to even the odds, but we need more of your generous investments...""

erie.6.t:0 "Less Visited Corridors"
erie.6.d:0 "Vincent didn't quite understand what Fabrice explained to him over charts and diagrams, but it certainly seemed flashy! Though, he'd have to decide if he really wanted to fund this escapade, the last one did not end particularly well for anygriff involved... and that poor pony. Shaking his head to dispel a haunting memory, the Duke was quick to return to his estates.\n\nInteracting with that criminal Sillègue was never pleasant, but it was necessary, he was quick to remind himself. Vincent would find Livio sequestered in the château's east wing, far from any noble company (who despised the griff on principle). Ignoring the shady figures who passed so often beside him, the Spymaster's hideout contrasted sharply to the workshop he just left. Meticulously ordered and devoid of gaieties, the room was dominated by endless stacks of papers, several boards hanging from walls which contained pinned notes and photographs. The griffon behind all of this seemed to brood in his chair, sharpening his claws with a knife.\n\n"Ah... my Duke. Are you here about the recent failures? I assure you, I've done my work as you requested."\nVincent was not feeling eager to get in the range of that dagger, so he stayed put at the doorway. "Partially. Was it true what Cyrille said, that you've given them false information?"\n"That bird couldn't tell day or night apart once he's high on his knightly mania. We captured some fools across the river and interrogated them, as usual."\nAs usual, yes. A familiar thread presented itself. "Did you torture them? I don't care for your methods, but you are aware they'll say anything to make it stop."\nIf Livio was perturbed at all by moral constraints, his cold glare confirmed otherwise. "I did what I needed to do. Nothing more."\n"You lack finesse, Sillègue. You've done good work so far in earning your freedom, but you made some missteps at crucial moments. That can't happen anymore, we cannot afford any more stalemates against Iovinus. I expect you to do better in the coming months."\n\nAcknowledging a grunt as confirmation, the Duke would turn to leave, but not before inquiring one last time. "As for your personal investigation... I trust it won't interfere with your primary responsibility?" There was a small clatter as the wicked knife fell on the floor."
erie.6.a:0 ""It won't. Now leave.""

erie.7.t:0 "The Eternal Frontier"
erie.7.d:0 "Dealing with Livio's hostile attitude was always something that deserved a drink or two, but Vincent had to press on with his responsibilities. Learning from the château's châtelaine that his esteemed sibling was touring the riverside, he would set out to join him, taking no personal guard alongside him.\n\nIt was both a blessing from Boreas and a curse from Maar that the great river flowed so closely from his holdings, though the location itself had few good things to say about it. Dreary and wearisome, holes dotted the blasted countryside intermixed with snaking trenches and small scale bunkers. Even the sky itself was clouded in a melancholic grey, the only colours of life he could spot were fallen pennants and banners, still clinging to those who carried them. How many met their demise here? The living few seemed like shadows, collecting lifeless husks of griffons for burial and equipment retrieval, but Vincent paid them no heed as he climbed an imposing hill.\n\nAs expected, Cyrille occupied this strategic redoubt, his precious honour guard watching the perimeter. Clad in gleaming panoply and armed with various polearms, their purpose seemed only to look imposing and harken to a bygone time. Brushing past the watching statues, Vincent would join his brother, both peering across the gloomy waters.\n"Dear Cyrille, why would you return to this horrid frontline? I feel that a prolonged time here could choke a griff in sorrow."\n"Our duty compels us to never falter, Vincent. I hold little love for the battlefield—", his bloodstained tabard suggested otherwise, "—yet I know one day, we'll restore life to fair Verenia, the war but a distant memory of a frigid Winter. I have faith in the strength of our paladins, and all who march with us to death and glory. Speaking of which, I am here to oversee the marshalling of our defences, and give proper respects to the fine griffons who gave their lives." He would then lean on his cruel looking halberd.\n"That is all fine and well, Cyrille, but I need you back at the château within the week. I trust you'll conclude your business in a timely manner?" Vincent wanted nothing more right now than the comfort of his fireplace.\n"Oh, of course. Do watch your head when you leave, my scouts spotted some forces milling at the other side. Wouldn't want harm to befall our good leader, yes?""
erie.7.a:0 ""Yes, yes. Farewell, till later.""

erie.8.t:0 "Good Old Days At The Academy"
erie.8.d:0 ""I'll say, mon Duc, I am always too glad when you spare some time for our evening indulgences", the Grand Inventor intoned in a jolly mood, in-between shuffling a stack of cards and refilling the shot glasses.\n"Think nothing of it, Fabrice, this is perhaps my only time to relax. Cyrille with his knightly nonsense in the morning, nobles and their prattle at noon, Livio with his passive aggressive attitude in the afternoon. If I weren't so invested in our struggles, I would have took my idols and moved to the Meridiennes a long time ago. Pass me the spirits, and do continue with that story of yours."\n\nVincent would usually say that rulers have no friends, only subjects and enemies, but Fabrice was anything but that. Professional when needed, amicable when in private, and all too reassuring despite the recent string of doom and gloom. Taking the fourth, or was it fifth, glass of Skyfall whiskey, he would contently rest his head on a claw and listen.\n\n"Naturally! There we were, right after stealing the rector's powdered wig, pondering on what to do with it. One of my colleagues said, 'Fabrice, you should just put it on your prototype clockwork!', and everygriff laughed at the idea! That curmudgeonly old bird deserved to be kicked a notch down... well, he did get kicked down, but so was I, for the first time. Maybe not my best idea." If he seemed to regret that, Fabrice didn't show it over his chuckling.\n\nThe idea of a machine wearing a wig gave Vincent quite the lark as well. "So, why don't you just invite your former friends? As in, here, to work with us? They seem like a clever bunch, though not as much as you."\n"Huh? Oh, yes! That would be a splendid idea! I am also reminded, I just finished today turning your investments into something useful. Care to hear? Our scientific breakthrough was quite astonishing."\nBut the Duke would only wave his claw at that. "Give me the paperwork when I leave, I'll read it tomorrow. Now, I am feeling particularly fortunate about this set of cards, so I will increase my bet...""
erie.8.a:0 "Surely, it will suffice."

erie.9.t:0 "A Knight's Resolve"
erie.9.d:0 "Château Erie's courtyard was an informal rally point for the household soldiers, yet Vincent did not know why his esteemed sibling gathered many on such a dismal day. To his credit, Cyrille and his paladin entourage looked like they haven't fought in a war only weeks ago, with their gleaming armour and heavy firearms slung over their backs. Yet the same couldn't be said about the griffs in attendance, many wearing casts and bandages, the poor rabble. Perhaps, he would simply listen and observe the commotion from a discreet vantage point.\n\n"I know what you're thinking, griffons—", the valorous captain began, in that same tone Vincent considered annoying, "—how could we have failed? Didn't you just recently hear, how the Erian warriors would be dining in Calembourg by the end of Summer?" A low groan was heard, as expected. "You did not fail, my friends. For there is nothing, no force, no weapon or alliance that can withstand the greatest virtue known to griffonkind - courage!" That seemed to have roused their spirits, if by a little. "All of you here, you fought bravely, in the proud legacy of your ancestors who defied Arantigans, Aquileians and others, and returned to tell the tale! I will personally assure all of you, the next battle will be ours, and the world will know that House Erie boasts the finest soldiers!"\n\nThe Duke wasn't quite impressed or even inspired by this rabble-rousing speech, but the same could not be said for the others. Many stood straighter and bolder, giving their salutes, a gleam of hope in their eyes. "Even now, more flock to join the cause of the Midnight Banner. Do you wish to be the ones to let down your comrades-in-arms?" A thunderous 'no!' was heard, as if they were one. Perhaps, thought Vincent, perhaps there is still a chance. One last opportunity to do it properly."

erie.10.t:0 "Listening To The Grapevine"
erie.10.d:0 "Paperwork was clearly Vincent's least favourite chore, but somegriff had to do it, and he had made a resolution to take a more claws-on approach with his underlings. Still, he wished that promise was made under the influence of wine, for his feathers seemed to get more ruffled with each letter read. Demands from city leaders for funding, invitations to the nobles' soirées, casualty reports from the front, when would it end? To make it even worse, his goblet had ran dry and that lazy servant hasn't showed up in the last hour.\n\nJust when the Duke was about to call it a night, a thin envelope with meticulous writing got his attention. This was the signature form of Livio, who abhorred giving reports in person, and preferred to do everything by letters and agents. Probably for the best, given how many griffs he managed to get upset in the previous month. Actually, was there anygriff who even liked him? That idea gave Vincent plenty of food for thought as he removed the wax seal and got reading.\n\n"My Duke,\nDespite the decreased resources given to me in the previous months, one of my agents has returned from her assignment with a promising prize. She told me that the information was obtained from a heavily guarded stronghold in a distant land, and after personal analysis, I can confirm its value. It has been passed on to relevant griffs, and you may find further details on the back of this page.\n—Ducal Spymaster Livio Sillègue""

Will you provide for them as we discussed recently?"\n\nAh. Vincent had hoped that Fabrice would have forgotten that particular empty promise he had made under the influence. It was all too easy to be charming, except when you had to actually own up to your words. Unfortunately, as he was in the middle of a luncheon with House Erie's cream of the crop (Livio was not invited), the question could not be put aside, as many eyes were now on their Duke.\n\n"Monsieur le Duc d'Erie", chortled one of the attending nobles, from House De La Framboise, "I believe the allocation of our dwindling treasury was discussed at the court just yesterday. Would it truly be wise to lavish what we cannot right now?"\n\nMaar's claws take them! Vincent could no longer pretend to savour the flavour of Wingbardian white truffle tagliatelle (enhanced with butter and aged cheese, his personal chef was worth every idol), the decision had to be made before the guests got rowdy. Waving with his claw while taking a sip of his favourite tannic red, he would take a quick glance over the attendees, stopping for the briefest moment at Fabrice's earnest gaze.\n"Excusez-moi, dear allies. The meal is simply to die for, and we are all too blessed to be together on this wonderful day. As for your inquiries, I've decided that...""

Can't you just build the designs yourself?"\n\nCyrille, standing next to his sibling, nodded in agreement. "House Erie is short on supplies as is, we can't afford to chase this flight of fancy. Besides, my paladins don't need these contraptions, our valour and training is more than enough."\n\nIf the brilliant inventor seemed dissuaded, he did not show it with his enthusiastic gestures over various photographs and blueprints. "But, Messieurs, can't you see? I could not develop these materiel in time to be relevant, and we need every advantage. If we could obtain just a small amount of either tanks or planes, Iovinus wouldn't be able to fight back!"\n\n"While honour does not preclude tactics, we would be gaining these weapons on such a short notice. Our soldiers have no experience using them, and you would essentially throw them into the onslaught unprepared. I would suggest, mon Duc, to simply invest in our domestic mining industry. More resources, more work for the peasants, no risk of importing Aquileian revolutionism." Cyrille sneered in disdain at the thought.\n\nThe day when any of his underlings all agreed on something was the day Vincent would send Iovinus a birthday present. Why couldn't they work together instead of acting stubborn and bickering over minutiae? Oh well, the Duke enjoyed being the arbiter, it was a clear reinforcement of his authority. Having made the decision in his mind, Vincent addressed the room."

Although, Vincent wouldn't need the favour of the divine if what his favoured inventor created proved to be as decisive as he was inclined to believe. Only thing, though, was that he did not know at all that was going on inside those many workshops, only that the price has been rather painful for his purse.\n\nNo matter, because today, a hastily written note was handed to the Duke from a courier, urging him 'to visit Fabrice at the earliest opportunity, for a wonderful weapon that would secure the dominion of Verenia is completed'. That put a smile on his beak, and without delay, Vincent would take to the skies, forgoing decorum to see at once what he was promised.\n\nAteliers Avault was busy like on any other day, but the frantic crowd parted like the sea before their liege lord, who was in great haste to reach his brilliant subordinate. He would find him in the workshop's main hall, tinkering at a strange contraption.\n\n"Fabrice, my good friend. I've received your letter and got here as soon as I could. Forgive the old wings, they're not as good as they used to be."\n"Ah, mon Duc! I am too glad that you are here. Fear not, you didn't miss out on anything. I must profusely thank you for all the trust and investment you've placed in me, for I believe it has now paid off. What you are looking at is the weapon that shall crush Iovinus into dust and ashes."\nVincent was not quite sure what he was looking at, maybe he was still dizzy from the frantic flight?

Fixating on the spymaster with a steely glare, he would respond: "Sillègue, what is the meaning of this? I told you not to scare me like that anymore. What is so important you couldn't send a note?"\n\nLivio paid little heed to the chastising as he pulled out a stack of papers for the Duke, and a fresh cigar for himself. "Thought I could stretch my wings. And let my master know what's going on in his holds." He stopped to blow out a whiff of smoke, ignoring the grimace growing on Vincent's face. "Read for yourself what has Fabrice tacitly approved of."\n\n"This is complete nonsense, Fabrice has given us great advancements recently—" His rebuke came to a halt as he read the reports. Peasants disappearing, unexplained property damage, strange lights... All near where Ateliers Avault had their branches. Knowing Fabrice those griffs would never be heard from again. This does explain the recent string of dissatisfaction — and sudden technological breakthroughs. Vincent would have to bring his house in order. "I see.

The simple answer is, no, there is no functional difference. We are the same, but with a different coat of paint, you might say.\n\nHowever, there are a few things that set us apart from our cousins in Herzland or Aquileia. First, the paladins maintain a tradition of service from the founding days of Verenia. Armour has gotten better and sturdier, certainly, and polearms and axes have been replaced with heavy calibre firearms, but our role remained the same: a vanguard of the few but brave, leading the charge from the front. There will always be knights, but we are the last to uphold the tradition of paladinhood.\n\nSecondarily, the paladins maintain their strong allegiances to their liege lords and the Gods. A paladin without a master is certainly considered a disgrace, but that can be corrected. However, one cannot truly be a paladin without devoting themselves to the Gods, be it one in particular or all of them. Always remember that Boreas, Arcturius and Eyr are watching, and we must earn their favour through righteous battle.\n\nAs you may have noted as well, from the appearance of myself and my subordinates... a paladin has to maintain some sense of style, no?

The Duke was certain he had not seen such pathetic grovelling in his lifetime.\n\nIovinus looked to the side where the nobles observed, some with encouraging looks, but the others scowled, Roman in particular. They weren't too fond of this pompous wretch either. "That's most despicable, captain Silverclaw, but you should have expected it when dealing with my wretched sibling.

Dulci griped while quaffing the last of her ale. "They're not paying nowhere near enough to justify working us to the bone."\n\n"You know what happened to the last ones who tried to complain, Dulci." Evrain, a local woodcutter, spoke in between bites of his oatmeal. "I don't like them anymore than you do, but I value more being alive."\n\nIt seemed nothing would come of their rebellious thoughts, until Gaston spoke up. "We don't have to be open about it. Why don't we pay a visit at night to the local lord's workshop and leave him a polite message?"

A whole perfectly good factory burned down, countless griffs killed, not to mention the other property damage! All that over a simple misunderstanding over the new conscription regulations. Fixing that had to be the first priority, as the Vicomte De Perdrix rose up.\n\n"Monsieur de Erie, the recent events were regrettable, but it was hardly a disaster. That district was underperforming for years, and honestly it was less expensive to tear it down than modernise it. The plan we came up with should solve the problem, as well as bolstering our assets for the future. But we will have to invest in better policing measures."\n\nThe Duke was happy with the proposal. The restoration of production, putting the peasants in their place, those were all excellent measures, but his scheming was interrupted by the "perfect" paladin in shining armour. "Mon Duc, I urge you to consider the following. I do not condone violence or insurrection, but we cannot push our servants too far. Show them some eleos, and we'll have a grateful populace that will support our goals."\n\nMust Cyrille always bother with this pious nonsense?

Why don't we make their lives a little easier, build a few new houses, offer charity and such? Surely, Eyr would look fondly on those who uphold Her virtues." Vincent only paid half the attention to his sibling as he did to the thoughts of a new marble sculpture of himself, as the Vicomte De Perdrix raised dissent.\n\n"Monsieur de Erie, myself and my colleagues believe that we should invest further in our industrial capacity. More factories, more production, better for us all. It shall repay us in dividends once Verenia is ours, and I suppose the peasants will benefit from it, somehow. They should be happy we're paying them at all, bah."\n\nAnother difficult choice for Vincent, it seemed.

The Duke was relatively certain everygriff had their lodging, training and firearms secured, but it was Cyrille who should be responsible for such. Vincent knew his sibling slacked on paperwork, but that wasn't the reason he was making a visit to him. He would find Cyrille in the nearby keep temporarily acting as the paladins' commandery.

But less so than the Duke, for making the poor people go into another pointless war again! When will it end, darling? When will we be allowed to live our lives in peace?"

Those vigorously dedicated to the high ideals for which all holy griffons labour would be rewarded with the command of virtuous companies of sanctified warrior-priests, the legendary lynchpin of the great Paladin-Commandant's might!\n\nThe atmosphere was solemn and ceremonial outside the great temple, armours and helmets gleaming under the Winter sunlight as acolytes took oaths, giving the newly minted paladins the standards of their service: sashes emblazoned with their pledges and vows, and newly forged mêlée weapons of the paladin's choosing. Of course, nogriff was expected to use them in battle, for it was merely a time honoured tradition that endured.

'Oh Vincent, you do not see the bigger picture.' Fool! I knew we had to act quickly, or else the revolution would spill out further, and we'd all be hanging in the nooses by the end of the month. Eventually, I convinced everygriff on a compromise: indiscriminate artillery shelling.\n\nIt went on for seven days and nights, followed by an all out assault. The mercantile scum, the ones we could find, we were given their well deserved and well needed punishment, yet the most difficult days were only ahead of us after the liberation of Calembourg."\n\n—From the memoirs of Vincent Erie, Duc'd Erie"

erie.42.d:0 "Among the rich and landed, few things matter as much as ceremony. This is especially the case for the established nobility, who still hold reign over vast areas of Griffonia. However, the ideas of Marksism and Kemerskainism are taking hold, little by little, making those with a title to their name especially clingy to the supposed good old days.\nOne of the purest examples can be found at the court of the self-styled Duke of Erie. Much like clouds circling an eyrie, the lesser nobles revolve around their liege lord, vying for favour with both claw and charm. However, this relationship is built on mutual respect and friendly relationships: the taxes and griffs they provide are repaid in protection and guarantees of rights. Verenia was once a part of the Périphérie, and as such it maintains Aquileian titles and ranks (in the lands controlled by the Duke of Erie):\n\nDuc - the ruler of all historical lands of Verenia, after the kingdom was abolished\nComte - owner of a comté, consisting of a city and its direct surroundings, a direct subordinate to the duc\nMarquis - ruler of a border region that demanded particular protection, owner of a marquisat\nVicomte - assistants to the comte, an administrative position that isn't inheritable, rules over a vicomté\nBaron - possessing a baronnie, they are often subservient to higher lords\nChâtelain - commander of a château and its surrounding lands\nPaladin - an idiosyncrasy that developed solely in Verenia, represents members of the local knightly chapters who are not necessarily nobles (there seems to be a distinction between having a title or rank of one)\n\nThese are merely the most prominent ones, and those not bestowed with a title can hardly make sense of the elaborate system, making them prefer the simple address of 'sieur' or 'seigneur'. It is more preferable than running risk of offence by misnaming their betters.\n\n—From Notoriety, Nobility and Novelty: a Griffon's Guide to Griffonia"

Vincent did not appreciate having this news brought to him.\n\n"I am very sorry, mon Duc, but it seems the bankers of Flowena have wised up after the first three loans that were never repaid. I've instructed our fall griff to be as inconspicuous as possible, yet he was caught somehow. I believe he is now in one of their infamous prisons for debt evaders." Baroness Belle Delphine was the Duke's favourite when it came to schmoozing with the foreigners outside of Verenia. She had the tact Livio lacked, and inexplicably strong charms, but those didn't help against the cold cruel claws of bankers.\n\n"At the very least, our investment was not lost with the griff. Thank you, baronne Delphine, we won't be bothering anymore with the Flowenans after this. Put your effort into places more likely to yield us an advantage from now on."\n\n"It is nothing, mon Duc, and I offer my apologies again." With that, she would shuffle out of Vincent's chambers, leaving him to ponder on his ever increasing debt. It was something that would have to be taken care of after the Struggle was over in his favour... and if not, those greedy idol counters would probably append his owned sum to one of his relatives."
erie.43.d_eyrie:0 ""Is that so, Freya? The bankers of Flowena still refuse to deal with us even though we have nothing to do with the debt Vincent has run up? Regardless of our proofs of no involvement with that imbecile?" Iovinus wanted to be a fair and just ruler, but moments like these made his blood boil. Alright, to be fair, anything involving Vincent made him seethe.\n\n"To be fair, my Duke, they do not simply seek the payment of idols Vincent has falsely accumulated under our name. There are also sums that date from before 978, and the bankers are very fond of their interest rates. There is nothing we can do to convince them on the matter, at least until we remove the rebels from the situation." The Duke's treasurer straightened her sheets and papers detailing the agreements the House of Eyrie has formed with the various Flowenan banks.\n\nFate was never kind to him, Iovinus believed that to be true ever since the revolution. "Very well, Freya. If our options are scant, then the winning move is not to play until we have an advantageous position. Resume your responsibilities elsewhere, but note that we will eventually sort out our problems with Flowena." Damned imbecile Vincent. He probably spent the idols on leisure instead of paying for soldiers, anyway."

I'm just saying, why does everygriff call him Cyrille when his name is Absolon? And if he is Duke Erie's brother, why is his last name d'Amphitre?"\n\n"Maybe he took it from his ancestor.

We could have intervened while they were fighting, but we were not ready in time. Katrina still remains closed from the world, and the commonfolk will begin to wonder if our scaremongering has any merit.\n\nThus we've decided to throw the die, and see who the Gods truly favour. Erian soldiers are still mostly occupied putting down resistance in former Eyrian holds, but they are certain to amass against us soon. Why wouldn't they? Verenia can only be united with either their or our defeat.

However, as soon as last of the resistance was quashed, they began looting and pillaging everything their claws could take, quickly fleeing afterwards across the eastern border. With our forces dispersed trying to hold down key positions, we were unable to intercept them, but my virtuous paladins will tend to the damages and give the civilians a measure of comfort.

Much to Vincent's surprise, the sprawling edifice has almost entirely avoided damage, as he walked down the lonely halls of what he called home so long ago. Nostalgia, elation, and a slightest tinge of sorrow - so many feelings went through the Duke's mind, finding the room he sought.\n\nWhere the throne sat, all of Verenia's history was on display. Colourful tapestries depicted its centuries long history, while busts of previous rulers silently watched as their newest ascendant passed. There was Kalem, who brought the tribe to these lands. There was Adelina, who lowered her banners to the Grovers. There was poor father, who passed away in such tragedy. The plinth that followed father was empty, the Duke noted with amusement. Vincent sat in the lofty ducal seat, his destiny fulfilled, pondering where to go from here. What does one do when his purpose was achieved...?\n\nThere was little time to waste. Summoning the servants to prepare for an impromptu coronation, a few hours would pass until the room's mood drastically changed. Surrounded by his peers and paladins, with a very furious and bound Iovinus forced to attend, Vincent kneeled as the city's prelate — Verena was her name, he recalled — performed the ceremony.\n\n"...and thus the Three recognise Vincent Erie to be the lawful duke of all Verenia...", but just as she was about to place the crown on his noble head, Vincent interrupted by taking the humble circlet to adorn it himself.\n\n"No, not the Duke of Verenia. The Grand Duke of Verenia." His smirk was triumphant as he stared down his defeated half-brother, the others making cries of approval and stamping their claws on the floor. Revenge was his.

Although it was still reeling from the most recent siege, repairs were quickly underway to restore the city to a semblance of grandeur, but more importantly, give the new Grand Duke a worthy capital from which he could direct the reconstruction of Verenia.\n\nThus the wide streets were cleared and decorated for the upcoming parade: the subjugated populace needed to be given an unsubtle display of the might that "liberated" them from the "oppressive" rule of House Eyrie. Said citizens had few good things to say about their new rulers, but they welcomed peace and more importantly, the free food given for attendance.\n\nYet everygriff had to stare in awe as lines upon lines of paladins marched down Calembourg, girded in their shining panoply. The bannergriffs carried the colours of their noble houses, the most common one being the Midnight Banner which represented House Erie, but there were plenty of others representing their minor vassals. After the paladins came the regular forces, no less distinguished in their martial pride, and at the end came various prisoners of war, with their dejected expressions."

Half-niece, that is." He looked down on the precocious bird sitting.\n\n"And you are Vincent Erie, the Duke of Verenia and my uncle. Half-uncle, that is." Truly there was nothing more flattering than imitation. He clasped his claws together and continued.\n\n"Grand Duke. I must say, I am shocked how you ended up in this situation. You naively thought you could solve the Struggle with 'talking', and you got overruled by your commanders, who raised hysterics and chaos in your absence. Who knows what would they have done with you if their plan succeeded." She looked away in despondence.\n\n"Ameli- mother always told me that the fighting was pointless.

But before he could confirm House Erie as the unquestioned rulers of this land, some stragglers had to be taken care of first. Namely, his "beloved" half-sibling occupying a cosy room in Calembourg's dungeons, along with his other ardent followers. Pity Iovinus' wife and children were far out of his reach, but at this point they were meaningless.\n\nThe burly guard nodded as he allowed his Grand Duke entry into the cell where Iovinus was kept. The sight of his rival, clasped in irons, so thoroughly defeated and humiliated, provided an unspeakable amount of satisfaction for Vincent. It's a shame he couldn't keep him like this forever... or could he?\n"Have you come to gloat, brother? Still the same immature chick I've last seen decades ago?"\nAh, of course he wouldn't give up without throwing some more barbs at him. "Why yes, dearest sibling. I believe that by the right of my might, I may gloat as much as I wish. Everything you've worked for has turned to dust, and Verenia is mine. How does that feel?"\nIovinus would only straighten his posture, as much as he could in chains. "Even fools have to get lucky sometimes."\n\nIf an outsider could witness the scene, they would believe Iovinus was the party dictating terms. Oh well, if he wanted to be stubborn and spoil the fun, Vincent would cut right to the point. "Then let this fool tell you what happens next, brother. To secure my position as the rightful ruler of Verenia, you and your followers have to be disposed of, and I don't feel particularly merciful."\n\n"Get on with it, you gutless sack of horseapples.

Vincent insisted on it in a grand display of spite and irony, as it was used in Aquileia during the First Revolution.\n\nThe gathered crowd watched quietly as the condemned were forced to stand in a line at the elevated podium, as a cloaked and veiled executioner ensured the instrument of death was ready. Even though the Grand Duke was known to be unsporting, there was no herald making a mockery of the prisoners; the execution was mandated to be in strict silence. The people had little love for Iovinus, but they did not try to defy the order, for he was a mostly fair ruler who tried his best to keep them happy in spite of everything.\n\nOne by one, a life was extinguished."

It seems that his nemesis was surprisingly merciful and decided to simply exile the poor griff, who arrived with a small escort of knights and retainers. Some of the local press attempted to interview the losing Duke, but he would brush off any questions with a scowl, demanding to be left alone.\n\nDays of speculation and gossip in Vederstad would resolve in a rather mundane outcome: Iovinus Eyrie owned a modest house in the town, occupied by his spouse and children, and soon settled into a boring daily routine not unlike the other citizens.

Brought me great joy to see my work pay off in such a spectacular fashion. I must ask, though, will you have further need of my services? I'll understand if you don't really need more weaponry." The hopeful expression beamed.\n\nVincent thought Fabrice was being facetious with such a naive remark. Of course he wanted him to remain! He was worth every idol invested! Not to mention, others would soon seek to sink their greedy claws into his Verenia. There was much that needed to be done. "Fabrice, please. You've more than earned your place at my side, and there is further need for your services. Fewer weapons, perhaps, but more production, factories, education. A brilliant griff like yourself could improve all those in record time, and be rewarded further." It wasn't flattery, but rather a reflection of truth.\n\nThe answer didn't take long.

Still, Vincent was most satisfied and he'd let Cyrille's grandstanding slide.\n\n"I've heard plenty about it from reports, yes. How you managed to completely evade any sort of injury is beyond me. Perhaps if I had a hundred of you, this would have been over ages ago." On second thought, that would have been hundred times as insufferable.

Except the cowards and deserters, who are awaiting their rightful punishment. Still... what do you need of us to do now? Turn our swords into ploughs?"

My secondary plans worked out far better, and you even got to exact your personal revenge. Shame for my friend, but we can now discuss the terms of our agreement. I believe I am owed what you promised me. Idols, freedom and so on."

As a gracious leader, I recognise your worth and you'll be rewarded with everything I've promised. Still, I must ask if you'll consider staying for a little longer.

The shady griff lazily stretched his wings across Vincent's fancy new table.\n\n"Wait. You've done a plenty in getting me here. Will you stay for a little longer, to ensure everything is secure? I don't like you, Sillègue, but you haven't done what Fa— he has done. There's very few griffs I can rely on around here, and if idols are your concern, you can help yourself to Iovinus' hoard of tacky junk."

No resource was spared in this task, but now he was starting to feel like his purpose was completed.\n\nRuling from the grand palace of Verenia's past lords was his dream ever since he was spurned in 983, but Vincent's glee didn't last for very long. It was simply more of the same from before: holding the court, reading letters, upholding the law. While cutting open the last letter of the night, from his old château's châtelaine, Vincent bitterly pondered how wanting is better than having.\n\n"Ah."\n\nThe note was simple in its succinct contents. Iovinus has passed away in the dungeons, apparently from an hunger strike. Whether anygriff was to blame for this outcome was irrelevant: Vincent felt hollow inside.

Still, we call upon our good and old rights to ask you to honour our agreement." Seigneur Des Fournaises slightly lowered his head while keeping one claw to his chest, and the other extended from him in an attempt to look gracious and deferential.

How would you suggest that we approach the matter?" The answer was obvious, but decorum was important.\n\n"The ones who suffered the most losses in the Struggle should receive the largest share, like I did. Our Lord of Verenia is of course entitled to expand his ducal estates, but keep in mind those who have valiantly fought for your claims.

After all, neither myself nor my colleagues have the time to plow the fields! We have very important duties to you, and Verenia!"

Let us not forget that the beautiful and good nobility owns everything of value in this land. They may cease 'plowing our fields', but they will continue being our subjects regardless."\n\nVincent found reason in her argument, but he knew what happened when you give somegriff an inch. They'll take a mile, and then the rabble will be storming the grand palace. Nonetheless, a decision had to be made."

erie.60.d:0 "Vincent enjoyed many privileges and powers as the Grand Duke, and while he could get away with kicking some simple-minded, ingrate peasant, dealing with his fellow nobles required a more delicate claw. He knew their kind: power-hungry, subservient only when it suited them, and scheming some way of obtaining further influence at his cost. Most of them, anyway, the ones that aligned with Cyrille's teachings were much more pliant and easier to control, but those were the ones he didn't have to worry about.\n\nWith Verenia unified and peace declared, Vincent would be forced to scale down on the military obligations of his vassals. That meant they would retreat to their estates, doing Boreas knows what, while exploiting the peasantry to the bone. It would certainly result in a higher tax return later on, but keeping a check on their activities could be more useful.\n\nThe one power Vincent always had at his disposal was simple. He could invite any noble to join his court at the grand palace in Calembourg, and only the most insolent griff would deny such a magnanimous display of hospitality. There, he could tie them up with pointless busywork while he focused on maintaining his grip on Verenia. It wouldn't come cheap, however..."

erie.61.d:0 "Savoir vivre - to live elegantly. This was reflected everywhere in this fanciful ball: to the choice of outfits, the party's theme (masks!), the string quarter playing a slow tune, and even the cool champagne Vincent was sipping while mingling with the Verenian nobility, and a few wealthy commoners who could afford entry to the grand palace's soirée. The style was so distinctly Aquileian it wouldn't be a surprise if the drapery started speaking the language!\n\nDuring a lull in the music, one of the minor nobles tapped a clawtip against the wineglass, letting the clear note ring out through the room. "Gentlegriffs! I believe we should offer compliments to our gracious host, the Grand Duke. He has preserved our traditions and made Verenia whole again. I'm sure all of us could not be more happier." Vincent held his head high as polite cheers and accolades were given.\n\nSoon after he would find himself holding the claws of baronne Delphine, as the closing dance of the evening began. The movements were practically instinctual, giving Vincent time to think on his latest obsession: if he should spread Aquileian culture (unblemished by the wretched revolution) across the entirety of his realm. Everygriff should enjoy this, this... unmatched bliss."

This all required a trained caste of clerks to work at the soon-to-be opened bank in Calembourg, and more pressingly, he had to decide whom to claw over the leadership of this institution.\n\nHe could pick some noble that bothered him about it recently. Straightforward, and he wouldn't have to give the bank any further thought. That would shift the balance in the Ducal Court, however, and one couldn't afford getting his subjects becoming too powerful.

Allow me to introduce you to a friend of mine. Good with numbers, law, and the skill of funnelling idols to the pockets of your choosing."\n\nSaid griff briefly raised his hat in recognition. "Mister Goodgriff at your service. I was called to the task." Somehow, that tone abated the previous hesitation. This better not be a scam."

Yes, she did a good job managing the ducal estates, but her constant prodding and annoyingly cheerful behaviour was becoming grating. Half-niece or not, who was she to push her beak into his business like this! "I could say the same for you, Katrina. Shall I ask some of the lesser families if they have sons to spare? I'm sure many would die for the opportunity to join our house through wedlock." Vincent coolly answered as they enjoyed a sunny day outside the grand palace, in the gardens.\n\n"And then what, some griff you don't like will become the new duke if you and Cyrille were to suddenly trip and break necks? Uncle, please. Verenia needs unquestioned succession. Those same families you mentioned have plenty of daughters, and you can afford to be choosy. Though, the nobles won't like if you pick one of the foreigners that came from Aquileia or Herzland." Katrina grinned as if she was decorating a very fanciful cake.\n\nWhile there was plenty of distant relatives to inherit the name of his house, Vincent had to begrudgingly agree with her. "Very well, dear niece. I'll begin looking for an appropriate match tomorrow, starting with...""
erie.63.d_alone:0 "Calembourg was already far in rebuilding, its manors filled with residents again and historical housing given a fresh coat of paint. Vincent was proud to see this occurring, as he strolled down the main street to attend the reopening of a restaurant he remembered fondly from his younger days. The owner may have been different, and the menu was certainly going to be changed, but nothing could ruin the value of nostalgia.\n\nWhile Vincent waited for his lunch (a wonderful onion soup), he couldn't help but to look around at the other attendees. There were griffs of all statures who could afford a decent meal, sure, but the commonality between most of them was that they were... taken. Couples looking at each other with youthful affection, husbands and wives exchanging knowing words. All that made the Grand Duke feel awfully lonely, and while he never lacked company in the past, he knew he needed to settle down eventually.\n\nAnd get those vultures off his back, as well. If he had yet another noble pester him at the court to marry his daughter, perhaps he would have to switch teams. Perhaps he shouldn't have banished Katrina, she would have made— wait, no, there was no need to become a Discret degenerate.

There was still another option to consider, and Vincent intended to go through them all before he got bored of this. This time, he would consider approaching..."

We did our part as a business to fund both sides, as long as their idols were good - but they stopped being good after some time. With limited options in chasing debt from foreign, distant debtors, we could do little but bar them from using our services, and spread word of their dishonest dealings.\n\nThis has changed as of today, with the newly minted Grand Duke announcing that he intended fully to honour his debts, and the arrival of many wagons of gold and valuables to settle both the principal amount and interest. Few expected such an outcome, but our bankers are now more than happy to deal with wealthy Verenian clients.\n\nAs long as their cheques don't bounce again..."

The land will be rich and bountiful, with the right sort of policy, and undoubtedly our coffers will be overflowing as well." The Vicomte pulled out a couple pages from his stack of papers. "Of course, I must remind you of our outstanding obligations to both domestic and foreign creditors. I commend your victory in the war, but if only it could have been... less expensive."\n\nDebt. The worst thing since the Republican Revolution of 978. Vincent turned to face the other griffon in the room. "Any progress with our Flowenan dealings, baronne Delphine?"\n\n"Have you not read the report I've sent you, Grand Duc?" Vincent liked to use paperwork he didn't care to read as kindling for the fireplace, so most likely not. "The wealthy families have been ousted and with them the banks have gone under. Literally, even, as I've heard about plundering by its new owners. As far as I'm concerned, we don't owe them anything anymore."\n\nNow that's something that put a smile on Vincent's face.

Alas, the Gods have a sense of humour and decided to put an end to this charade.\n\nToday, we have ambassadors from [From.Capital.GetName], bearing the word of [From.GetLeader]. Due to our long standing shared cultural heritage, he has expressed a desire for our nations to be brought closer together in the spirit of friendship and cooperation. What shall be our response to this petty despot east of the Aranti river?"

I am most pleased to announce to all of you, my good colleagues and nobles, that [From.GetNameDef] has been most amenable to our approaches. Nothing has been put to paper yet, but the reports I've received suggest that it won't take too much effort to seal the deal." She proudly beamed at the success of her diplomatic mission, with many in the room expressing cheers and jubilations. Amidst the happy voices, a dissenting one struggled to be heard:\n\n"But how can we know they're being honest with us? What if this is part of their ploy?" While few heard the griff and even fewer took it seriously, Vincent did make a mental note to account for any possible trickery.

We've barely begun to rebuild, how can we hope to stand against the might of [From.GetNameDef]?" One of the minor nobles quipped in panic, with the rest joining as the fear of losing property, serfs and other noble indulgences settled in the minds of many.\n\nVincent had nothing to be happy about, of course, but he wasn't going to give up so easily. "If they won't protect us, then we'll seek allies in the Périphérie." This hardly pleased anygriff, the idea of working together with swindlers, bankers and other such rabble, but he pressed with his idea.

Remember when we first left Erie all those years ago, back in 978? I thought it would be a simple matter, a one and done problem we could forget about in a year." Truly Vincent felt his age remembering those times. Surely, it was worth it, with Verenia finally united...?\n\n"Everything we've achieved will fill about a dozen history books, I agree. But what do we do now? There are no more grand battles to fight. Are the paladins doomed to turn their rifles into ploughshares?" He cast his look to the side, eyes filled with uncertainty.\n\n"No, there will be plenty of battles to come. The age of wine and gilded arms is over, replaced with the time of shells and bullets.

Did he keep them in closets to bring out whenever he needed to make Vincent feel uncomfortable?\n\n"It is as we previously agreed, my Duke. I would serve you until you sorted out this Verenian business, and then I'd be free to go. Is he not a griff of his word?" Livio punctuated his feigned hurt feelings by blowing smoke from the ever present and ever annoying cigar.\n\n"Yes, yes, of course I'll keep my word, but I still have need of you! Did we not also agreed that I would provide the resources for your search?" There was only a dismissive wave of the claw in return.\n\n"I appreciate that—", his tone was not grateful at all, "—but I think I can solve my problems on my own. Thus, I'll be departing tomorrow, but do not find me ungrateful for... giving me a chance to prove myself. To that end, I brought Comte des Ba—"\n\n"Comte who? The only comte in Verenia is Cyrille—", Vincent was quickly hushed by Livio, as the revealed stranger shot a fierce glare. "Indulge him, my Duke. I taught him all there is to know about intelligence gathering, and Comte des Battes shall be a worthy replacement for my role. Now, I have a few things left to wrap up before I leave, so you'll have to forgive me if I don't have time for you, my Duke."

While I've been here the briefest compared to the others, it was still very much worthwhile for your pleasant company. I'll always cherish it, but my grand design can't quite be realised here anymore. Once more, congratulations on your victory, I know you'll make the best of it." He would briefly turn around to shout at the sluggish workgriffs to be more careful with the packages they were carrying.\n\nThe Grand Duke pondered and pondered, but he couldn't really think of any convincing words. Did he really make Fabrice feel unappreciated, one of his very few friends? This thought would bother him for weeks after, but for the moment he offered his claw. "Think nothing of it, Fabrice. Best of luck to you, wherever you go, but please remember to keep in touch if you can."\n\nWith a nod and a smile on his beak, Fabrice took Vincent's claw and shook fondly.

I couldn't believe it myself either, but here we are! Are you finding your new accommodations here in Calembourg to your liking?" Flushed in his victory, Vincent was far more easygoing and welcoming to flattery, not that he would reject it from one of his few true friends.\n\nSitting down to his chair, Fabrice continued: "Much more spacious than what could be spared back in Erie, yes. With the rest of my assets moving along, I'll be more than happy to continue providing my services to the state, if it satisfies your will." A slight tinge of disappointment was heard in his tone, but it went unnoticed.\n\n"We have so much ahead of us, and I'm very glad that you're with me in this. I must admit I was feeling a little lost with my new responsibilities, I never thought I'd get here, but..."

The centrepiece of the celebration was a showcase of agricultural and culinary talent: there was plenty of competition to prove who honoured Eyr best with the bounty of the land. Elsewhere, the Prelate was giving her blessing to expecting partners, each hoping to expand their families, while more discretionary couples sought places hidden from eyes.\n\nThe festival was concluded with a local custom involving crafting straw effigies of Maar. Each was appraised and graded, with the ones considered most terrifying or farcical burned for merriment. A clear reminder of the time when the Three cast down the malevolent Maar, punishing him for his treasonous actions."

Though, all the idols in the world didn't seem worthwhile with the utterly boring chick in front of him. Good thing the dinner provided him with much opportunities to simply not talk.\n\n"You are most wonderful, Grand Duc! I am so grateful that you picked me to be your wife!" Esmée Radis spoke with little tact and too much presumptuousness. Vincent had to mask his groan by heavily indulging in wine.\n\n"That has not yet been decided, madame, but your compliments warm my heart." Not the biggest lie of his lifetime. "That being said, would you like to attend a play later this evening? The local theatre is having a run of Love Amongst The Kirins." Which was decisively less impressive without actual kirins involved, but acting was always about winging it.\n\n"Oh, a play? Does it mean it will be funny? Is there going to be more food? These portions are so small!" Vincent was this close to having a paladin throw her outside, if not for the complaining he'd get after from Esmée's father. On the other claw, he could just effortlessly woo her into marriage, and afterwards do as he pleased..."
erie.75.d_baguette:0 ""Watch where you're strutting! Worthless peasant!"\n\nVincent was having a casual evening stroll with a potential marriage candidate, but the longer the night went on, the more second thoughts he was having. Sidestepping for the scolded commongriff, he wondered how did Pétronille Dupoignard turn from "love at first sight" (she was incredibly beautiful) to "jump into a river" (her nagging would wear out the most patient mind).\n\n"I can hardly say that was needed, madame Dupoignard, even if he was, as you stated, a worthless peasant..." The Duke's voice trailed off into softer tones as she turned around to affix her steely gaze on him.\n\n"Not 'needed', Grand Duc? It's the lack of discipline and manners that turns creatures to such unruliness! Have me as your wife and I'll put some order around here!" Vincent could not remember the last time somegriff spoke so fiercely towards him, and it gave him an equal mixture of dread and... intrigue.\n\n"That remains to be decided, madame. Shall we go to the art gallery now?" A terse nod followed, and Vincent had to ask himself if the soldiers her parents promised as a dowry would be worthwhile in exchange for perpetual emasculation. He would have to pick his words very carefully."

They seemingly got along at first word. Vincent truly felt that she was the right one... if not for the unfortunate circumstances regarding her family. Why did so many have a problem with Herzlanders? Nobility is nobility!\n\nSoft giggling escaped her beak. "You are most gracious, Grand Duc! I could scarcely recall last time anygriff had such a way with words! 'You tell me of our future that you plann'd', as it is said!" The implication was not lost on Vincent, as he extended his claw towards the balcony.\n\n"Come, let us observe the stars."

His younger self would undoubtedly disapprove that the days of philandering are now over, but as he reminded himself often, this was for the good of Verenia.\n\nThere were some benefits, however. No more nobles nagging him about their daughters, his soon-to-be in-laws promised and delivered a sizeable prize... and this outfit was made by one of the finest tailors from Skyfall. With all the stress and misery of running a state, there was finally one day to simply unwind and relax. It was good to be the Grand Duke.\n\nWith a sigh and a shake of his head, Vincent crossed the temple's threshold to join his future wife."

It is true, I was an illegitimate offspring, but father did recognise me before his untimely passing, and as the eldest it was my right.\n\nHe wouldn't have any of it, but Amelinda suggested a compromise where we would both rule as equals. Her optimism was in the best of intentions, but the outcome was... less than ideal. Still, for a few more years, I did my job while Iovinus slacked off and chased flights of fancy, like his beloved paintings.\n\nEventually, it would all break down in 983. Iovinus was particularly stubborn during a budgetary meeting and insisted we allocate a majority of the idols into frivolous things like education and social welfare, whereas I'd have none of it and demanded it went to strengthening the armed forces. It was chaos out there! Verenia needed to be protected from the damned republican rabble!\n\nWhen nothing worked out, I walked out with my supporters, and intended to force the matter.

Thus we agreed — for the lack of a nicer word — to briefly stop fighting each other.\n\nYet that was when Amelinda took her chance and spirited away with half of my holdings, and many disgruntled nobles. How could I have been so blind to this mutiny? If we could we would have quashed this disrespect, but we were too spent and weak. Not to mention, Iovinus would have had a very easy time attacking us while we were distracted.\n\nFortunately, Amelinda persisted in her delusional approach, getting nowhere as the fighting continued.

It is pretty obvious that the others have very little to no appreciation for your skills, but I genuinely do think you're not as bad as you look."

Of course, plenty would be brought from elsewhere, various private collectors who had seen the benefits of goodwill by donating theirs. And speaking of goodwill, entrance would be free for the first month, to give the lower classes something to loiter about.\n\nThe opening evening was a sumptuous, if restrained ceremony, and the Duke of Verenia was its guest of honour. Attended by his noble retinue, he was escorted by a handsome young griffon who served as the gallery's curator. As they passed between room to room, each with its theme, intriguing commentary was spoken and exchanged. The Duke had several colourful commentaries of his own regarding the artwork, such as the series of paintings depicting the life of Grover the Second ("Grover the Overrated, more like"), exact replicas of sculptures from the famed Canterlot Garden ("Why did we care about ponies again?") or some strange shapes that were puzzling in their representation ("Some called it avant-garde, it must be a fad").\n\nThe strangest thing seen, however, was a sculpture depicting what seemed to be a griffon. Unlike real ones, this one stood on its hind legs, like a minotaur, clutching an odd glaive with a rounded tip. When pressed for detail, the curator explained it was a proposed portrayal of griffons before they lost their magic. The lord of Verenia could only scoff at the absurdity."

Kerensky? Kerenskiai? Whoever he was, Hubert cared little, but apparently he was the cause of everything bad around here.

He even took a little trinket to remind him of the time.

Free from the Struggle, free from woes, and last thing he heard, all militiagriffs got some kind of reward.

erie.98.d:0 "Griffs today would have you believe that feudalism is one of the staples of our society, tracing back to the semi-legendary descent from the Hyperborean Mountains. Even across the sea, the Sun Princess has her own noble ponies, although their power has all but eroded today. This is, of course, a contemporary misconception.\n\nShould one look up the term in a book today, it would say that feudalism is "a social system based on the relationship between the landholder and those who provide services and labour in order to live there". This conflates two distinct concepts that have often co-existed (but not always) called manorialism and vassalage. The former describes the economic system which structured the relations between free griffons (later on serfs) and their elite landlords, whereas the latter is a political system which structured relations between ruling classes.\n\nFor example, while the manorial system was already established in the time of Arantigos the Conqueror, in a legal sense Arantigos did not have a series of fealties and homages given to him by his subjects. Rather, it was an informal arrangement backed by force, with a caste of professional bureaucrats overseeing their obligations. The concepts of vassalage and suzerainty would not appear until the Discrets' consolidation of power, but in its most pure state, it was introduced by the Groverian dynasty as they organised their vast empire into a civilised polity.\n\nIn conclusion, while manorialism and vassalage appear to be inexorably connected, they are separated systems explaining relations between two different classes of griffons. It begs the question if feudalism is even the right word to describe the society of the past, and even today.\n\n—From Fiefs and Vassals: Tyranny of Ages Past"

erie.99.d:0 "Feeble ponies might have invented gunpowder, but it was griffons that turned it into a deadly weapon.\n\nAnd how quickly they were to adopt it! Boreas given ingenuity allowed griffons to create at first crude firearms, then muskets of increasingly improving firing rates, to rifles that had unmatched killing power. Everycreature was eager to purchase these weapons, quickly dropping any usage of pikes, swords and shields in favour of shot and powder. Though one might expect that the griffon knightly tradition would die out with proliferation of weapons that could penetrate armour, it only resulted in enchanters refining their craft so that they could keep up with new advances.\n\nThe popularity and ease of usage meant griffons developed a culture in which personal ownership of firearms was something acceptable, for purposes of hunting and self-defence. Repressionary rulers would often attempt to restrict this, to little success, and self formed militias were a common sight in the disturbingly common uprisings that plagued Griffonia before the Groverian emperors brought peace to the land. Even today, very few would ruffle their feathers at the sight of a griffon carrying a weapon, as the unspoken social contract guaranteed any attempt for unprovoked hostility would be met in return.\n\n—From Idols and Gunpowder: the Ingenuity of Griffons"

With that, he passed over a rather hefty looking bag.\n\n"Oh fine, let me take a look. Huh, what is this? It's just a bunch of rocks!

Good thing the frontline wasn't so far away, or else she couldn't afford this digression.\n\nShe would find the Grand Duke in his study, absentmindedly shuffling through a book.

"Ah, servant! Has the battle gone well? Is that cur Iovinus finally in a cage where he belongs? Give me the news now!" Alas, the retainer was too cowed by his superior leadership skills and could only meekly deliver his missives. Wasting little time, the Duke tore off seals from letters and began reading.\n\n"Calembourg taken... Victory is ours...?" Something didn't seem right here. Yes, these letters had all legitimate seals, and the griffonage was unmistakeably Cyrille's, but it felt like it wasn't supposed to be this easy. Was he simply so trapped in the Struggle to even comprehend the idea of success? He gave the quiet griff a suspicious look. "Is this true, peasant? House Eyrie has fallen before us?"\n\nThe messenger only shrugged, scratching his beak in boredom. "Some of the nobles are already planning a feast, your lordship. Should you not be ecstatic for this?" And he would have, yet there was a persistent feeling of manipulation. What if everygriff was lying?

Griffs paid him tribute from Fezera to Pridea, he had to delegate so many responsibilities of administration to nobles he considered trustworthy to some degree (for he clearly had no desire or skill to manage everything by himself), and major foreign powers which previously considered Verenia beneath them now feared him.\n\nAs they should. Legacy is an interesting thought to chase: it began in small measures and only grew from there. At first it was simply to secure a stable succession, now it was becoming greater than any past conqueror. A fit of hubris, certainly...

As he lazily slouched in his chair, fumbling with a cube shaped object, his moment of peace was interrupted by the door being banged upon by... several claws, apparently.\n\n"Were you raised in Gryphia? Mind your manners, who is it!" Vincent angrily demanded.\nThe door gave way to his advisors, strangely unified in their purpose, their glares filled with scorn. It didn't seem out of the ordinary for Livio, but noble Cyrille and mellow Fabrice? This made the Duke feel very nervous.\n\n"Mon Duc, we heard what happened. And this, this cannot stand! I will not sully myself by continuing to take part in this travesty." Fabrice turned tail and stormed out of the room, leaving behind a pin that signified his favoured status.\n"I must concur, sibling of mine. If our father, Boreas protect him, was still here, he would be so ashamed!" Cyrille would drop his helmet and stomp out of the room as well, his tail flicking angrily.\n"I'm no virtuous soul, we both know what I've done, but I was NEVER a cheat. Maar curse you." Livio would leave too, finishing this sudden bout of humiliation for Vincent.\n\nBefore he could recover and figure out what happened, a rock shattered the window and almost struck the poor Duke in the head.

erie_fabrice.1.d_destruction:0 ""...is that an ordnance shell? It looks considerably larger, though." Vincent clawed at his beak in confusion. Didn't seem like it could fit into any barrel, either. What exactly was Fabrice's ploy?\n\n"No, not at all, my Duke! What you are looking at is an experiment in brilliance. Ordnance is powerful, but it has a range limit, and so do the planes we've fortunately acquired from our Aquileian friends. These rockets, as I've come to call them, represent the next stage of warfare, as we leave behind the brave warrior risking his life in combat. Quite passé, if you ask me. But I digress - this weapon will allow us to safely strike at the other side of the river with no danger for any of our soldiers. I've found the most difficult challenge to be ensuring that the guidance system is precise..."\n\nFabrice was brilliant, but perhaps a bit too much, because Vincent stopped paying attention to his rambling. Rather, he focused on what he understood - devastating assault making short work of the notoriously entrenched riverbank. The paladins would simply cross over, hack away at any unfortunate enough to survive the attack, and victory would be his! Oh, glorious day! The Grand Inventor was worth every idol. Speaking of which, he raised his claw to interrupt:\n\n"How much did it cost, Fabrice?"\n\n"It was within budget, though I had to scrap some of the planes for parts. I predict we'll have about twenty of these prepared."\nGood, Vincent couldn't afford bankruptcy, he still owed much to Flowenan banks. "Most excellent.""
erie_fabrice.1.d_protection:0 ""That's just a paladin's suit of armour. Cyrille has at least four in his chambers, for aesthetics." Vincent clawed at his beak in confusion. The protection was quite shiny, but didn't appear to be special in any form.\n\n"Ah, but there's a catch, my Duke! Observe." He watched as Fabrice strolled in front of the chest piece, pulling out a revolver and firing point blank. The clang reverberated in the Duke's ears, wincing from the sudden noise.\n\n"I don't see the point of—" But before Vincent could regain his bearings, Fabrice subjected the panoply to increasingly tougher punishments, using stronger firearms, blunt objects and even throwing a vial of green liquid at it. The Duke had two questions in his mind: where did he learn to use guns, and how is that thing still untarnished? Not even a dent, as it shined brightly, reflecting the inventory's smug visage.\n\n"H-how? Fabrice, did you invent invincibility?" Griffon armour was known to be durable, but this was something else entirely. "Can we just walk to Calembourg, clad in this? Is this some pony magic?"\n\n"Ponies? Bah, how could they measure up to the ingenuity of griffonkind? I merely worked with our artificers and figured out an appropriate alloy, with a new enchantment that shrugs off everything... To a certain size. The enchantment wears off quickly, but I've secured enough material to make it last for the crucial moment. Our paladins will stare at Maar in the eye, and will not falter."\nVincent hoped invincibility was cheap, he still had to repay those vultures in Flowena. "Most excellent.""
erie_fabrice.1.d_machinery:0 ""Quite the length on that barrel, Fabrice, but don't we have enough artillery already?" Vincent still stroked at his cheek in amazement, thinking about the size of the ammunition that thing would use. Not to mention the recoil.\n\n"Quite honestly, my Duke, the artillery crews do a sloppy job even on the best of days. We can attribute many reasons to past failures, but plenty of times did they fail to cover the assault. Now, no sense crying over spilled wine, but I've decided the best course of action is to correct this problem. Later on, after we seize victory, we can train the griffs properly."\n\n"But where will this cannon be mounted upon? I don't think any chassis we have could support it."\n\n"I thought about using some of those tanks we acquired from our Aquileian friends, but those frames were simply too fragile to carry it. No, it will be placed upon a modified train, upon which it will easily follow the troops as they progress forward. I have already gathered the best griffs for the task of firing, reloading and maintaining, while while myself will personally ensure its accuracy. Two, three shots, and fortress Eyrie will be a ruin." The proud inventor gleamed as he polished the barrel's exterior.\nVincent hoped the shells for the railway gun were cheap, Flowena would collect on his debt eventually. "Most excellent.""

It was a reverence towards the good old days, the flower of tradition which bloomed ever on, despite the evils of Kemerskainism that have spread far and wide. One after another, with an ornamental mace in their claws representing their oaths, each gathered head of noble families that served the Midnight Banner repeated and renewed their oaths.

Somehow, nothing could actually injure the paladin in shining armour.\n\nAbsently trying to assuage his anxiety by looking over some nondescript maps and paperwork, the Duke knew that this his last opportunity to claim Verenia for himself. Everything that wasn't strictly mandatory was sold off to fund the effort, and the damned rabble would be raising Tartarus again over the war.

Sometimes he would sleep for days, sometimes he would work day and night. What was most important, however, is that the brilliant designs he visualised in his mind came true.\n\nThus he was sitting in his well stocked workroom of his private home, a manor that was granted to him after Calembourg was taken from the vile Eyrians. He wasted no time setting it up to his preferences, and while observing some particularly small machine parts through a magnifying glass, Fabrice reflected on his stay here and what he achieved.\n\nEverything was in motion. All of it led him to this exact second in time. It was his ideas that helped his employer reach this state. Of course, the others did their part, but it was he who rightfully earned so much praise and rewards. He wasn't above exploiting Vincent's generosity, but for now Fabrice had everything he wanted, a golden age of discovery that would follow in his wake.\n\nA "guest" awaited him in the downstairs laboratory.

He had no issue admitting he wasn't the smartest griff in the room, but his friend should really remember to simplify his explanations more often.\n\n"Forgive me, mon Duc. Allow me to demonstrate." The brilliant inventor turned around to pick up a dull coloured block with tweezers, only to drop it into a nearby beaker half-filled with water. Almost immediately, the block caught fire and started dissolving, creating steam. "A simple chemical reaction. Metal reacts with water, producing gas. These reactions are what allow us to use firearms, electricity, automobiles, and so much more. What I was trying to explain is that I am on a trail to discover reactions that produce... an unimaginable amount of energy. Now, it will require considerable resources and time to refine it into something we can use, but I am obligated to report to you anything groundbreaking." He would absentmindedly add a few drops of something into the water which turned it purple.\n\n"That's quite fascinating, Fabrice, but can you guarantee it will lead somewhere? The last thing you showed me had to be turned into a hallway attraction, because it wasn't good or practical for anything else." Vincent always avoided that hallway out of simple self-preservation.\n\n"Oh, definitely. This is the future.""

The nobility in particular has groused long and plenty about their liege lord showing too much favour for a "lowborn foreigner", and today was little different.\n\nMarquis Des Groseilles, the portly annoyance, was interrupting Vincent's luncheon with his favourite advisor. "Monsieur le Grand Duc, I must protest at your recent decision to put the control of education in the claws of this... parvenu scoundrel!" Said scoundrel had nothing to say but smirked in response.\n\n"Is that the problem, Marquis? That the Grand Inventor is not of noble bearing?" Vincent decided to cut straight for the issue.\n\n"I— well yes, mon Duc! Only griffons of exalted virtue and pure blood are worthy enough to manage the matters of state!" He made that statement as if it were the unquestioned, immutable truth of the world.\n\n"Very well then. As the lord and ruler of Verenia, I declare right here and now that Fabrice Assaultine will become an official member of the Grand Duke's noble court, with all privileges entitled to its members." Oh how Vincent enjoyed the shocked sight on the marquis' face!"

erie_fabrice.12.d:0 "Fabrice was truly peerless in his craft. Was there anygriff as brilliant as him? Certainly not! But this latest conundrum proved to be a great obstacle, even for one as gifted as he was.\n\nBefore him, in this workshop of creation, was an internal combustion engine, in all its metallic blocky glory. Hardly a novel concept, but Fabrice was always pondering on further ways how to improve its efficiency. It was, after all, one of his first successful experiments, yet perfection was always just out of reach. "Pureness of gasoline appears to have no impact on performance. Trying out a different oil mixture to increase cooling ability." The inventor was fond of monologuing on his lonesome, as he found it to be good for concentration and memory.\n\nLike the previous... six times, or was it seven, Fabrice emptied the machinery of fluids, added replacement ones, and set it back into motion. The pistons made their cyclical procedure — intake, compression, combustion, exhaust — and he observed with rapt attention. "Noting slight improvement in cycle timing. Increasing power." The machine's hum steadily grew, and he closed his eyes to immerse in the process. "Mixture 7C confirmed for acce—"\n\nJust as he was about to declare his brilliant triumph, a low groan was heard from one of the pistons, quickly followed by a lick of flame singeing Fabrice's cheek. With a yelp, he fell to the floor, smacking his face with a claw to put out the fire (thankfully, the moustache was unharmed). The panic would subside shortly, as it was hardly the first time this happened, and he looked up to see the engine blissfully inert, having spent its fuel."

Yes, here's how we remember the tale of paladin Foisine."\n\n"We recall he was all the order stands for: honourable, brave, reverent to the Gods. For that he would earn much prestige, his sash heavy with honours. Of course, any paladin who served with such distinction would be worth their weight in gold, and Foisine wisely invested his into building a splendid château, and showing generosity to the needy."\n\n"Alas, all was not perfect for the noble paladin. He served a cruel master, one baron Proulx, who was not always this wicked, but his heart grew dark with years of vice. The peasants who served Proulx spoke of wanton acts of violence, and riots were frequent. Foisine saw what was happening, but he did not attempt to stop his master, in accordance with the vows one gives to Boreas. Always be loyal to your masters, students..."\n\n"However, one day Foisine would experience something that made him reconsider his stance. Whilst hunting in a forest for food, he saw lightning crack across the sky, with nary a cloud in sight! This was surely the wrath of Boreas, showing his displeasure of the villainous baron, and our paladin pondered if his actions were proper and righteous. What do you think happened next, students?"\n\nAs before, Marceau was the one to raise his claw."
erie_cyrille.1.d_arcturius:0 ""Hmmm... yes, this should do. The tale of paladin Blanchette, an unsung hero of a battle long past."\n\n"There was a time, before griffons built their high and mighty states, when war was waged with swords and shields. Yet there were always paladins, these brave knights that fought for their lords and upheld the values of the Gods. One of them was Blanchette, who was by most accounts not the most successful or devout of paladins, but she still served to the best of her abilities."\n\n"Much like the struggle we face today, Blanchette served a master who was locked in a feud with another one, and their battles were bloody. The outcome was never in either favour, and she wanted nothing more than to return to her husband and children. But the camaraderie she had with her paladin comrades gave her the resolve to do what is needed."\n\n"The next battle was a decisive one. Close ranks of griffs bearing pikes advanced on the outnumbered paladins, with Blanchette and her unit unable to break their formation. With their captain far away in the chaos of mêlée, they had no plan beyond base survival, but if they did nothing, the battle would have surely been lost. What do you think happened next, students?"\n\nAs before, Marceau was the one to raise his claw."
erie_cyrille.1.d_eyr:0 ""Very well, class. Let me see... ah, of course! The fable of good paladin Germain will suffice for this lesson."\n\n"Germain served as a paladin to an early Verenian duke, who tried to expand his holdings into what is today Pomovarra. This suited our paladin, who strived above else to attain martial excellence. He was a frequent tournament goer, and his battlefield prowess was spectacular. All this would to go to Germain's head, and he begun openly boasting that only the Gods could strike down his rising star."\n\n"Indeed, Germain's pride would soon be tested in the next campaign for Pomovarran lands. In an early battle, he got separated from his unit, chasing down fleeing levies who were of no threat or importance to him. Rather than sate his ego with the sight of an enemy fleeing from his might, the paladin needed the satisfaction of his foes facing them when they met the end of his halberd. In his arrogance, Germain would not notice he became surrounded by a group even he could not take on. What do you think happened next, students?"\n\nAs before, Marceau was the one to raise his claw."

Foisine would begin to subvert his master's actions as much as he could, at the expense of his purse. The love of gold is endemic to a griffon, but he overcame it in a pursuit of justice."\n\n"Baron Proulx would eventually meet his ignoble end when a distant relative of his returned to claim his properties. As it turns out, Proulx cheated his relative out of the inheritance, and when he called upon paladin Foisine to defend him from this 'pretender', he was nowhere to be found. Know this, class: be loyal to your masters, but do not impugn your honour in doing so."\n\n"In the end, Foisine would find employment under the new baron, his purse refilled and his service gleaming till the end of his days.

This was no suicidal action, however, for she broke pikes with her claws, and created a gap in their line by throwing her body at them."\n\n"Indeed, she took down many of them, but she was only mortal. However, when her unit saw the selfless act of courage, they rushed into the gap, breaking the dense formation and decisively carrying the day for their master. The feud would end soon, but the master and the paladins would honour paladin Blanchette, remembering her when they performed their sacred duties to Arcturius.

Many have heard what happened, as gossip travels quickly by road and wind, and eventually Germain would retire as a paladin. Though his wounds and armour were mended, his pride was broken forever, as he purchased a small plot of land near Lake Rumare to live as a simple farmer."\n\n"In time our paladin would gain a great fondness for the land. What was a rigid chore began to grew on him, and his crops were the largest and tastiest in the village. Soon, he began making relationships with the griffons who initially paid no heed to the stranger, and his standing in the community grew, as he became a respected leader that provided help in both labour and food. Not to mention, the wife he would marry would give him many chicks."\n\n"Though none of the griffs would learn of his prideful past, it would briefly resurge near the end of his life, as he claimed to have received a vision of Eyr, praising him for his life of agriculture. Most would shake their heads at the old loon, but it is without doubt that former paladin Germain exemplified the virtues of Eyr. What do you consider to be the moral of this story, students?"

The way those griffs listened with rapt attention to his stories gave him much motivation to continue doing the Gods' work. Each new paladin would upheld the proper virtues, and woe betide anygriff who strayed from the path of light.\n\nSpeaking of his most recent lecture, Cyrille has been giving it much pondering.

"Myself and the paladin captains have strategised over our options for the attack. We do not have a breadth of choice, but this time we've come up with something unorthodox." He extended his wing to a map, laid over the table, which the others observed with mild interest.\n\n"I do not have aptitude for military theory, Knight-Commander, but rest assured I'll provide whatever you need to succeed." Fabrice nodded deferentially as the ignored spymaster took notes of the battle plan.\n\n"There you have it, then." Vincent clasped his claws together on the desk.

It was a reverence towards the good old days, the flower of tradition which bloomed ever on, despite the evils of Kemerskainism that have spread far and wide. One after another, with an ornamental mace in their claws representing their oaths, each gathered head of noble families that served the Midnight Banner repeated and renewed their oaths. Vincent thought it was a great shame he'd never see Iovinus willingly kneeling like this.\n\nYet despite all these flashy promises, the nobles still had significant leeway in how much of their forces they would commit.

"The Gods are on our side, Vincent", he said. Will Boreas bring back the only family member he had care for? Obviously he didn't give a flying feather about Iovinus and his spawn, and he never met Katrina to begin with.\n\nAbsently trying to assuage his anxiety by looking over some nondescript maps and paperwork, the Duke knew that this his last opportunity to claim Verenia for himself. Everything that wasn't strictly mandatory was sold off to fund the effort, and the damned rabble would be raising Tartarus again over the war. If only they understood that he would make everything better, that he would give them plenty of reasons to respect their betters.\n\nNothing more needed to be done.

Clutching her sash as her company was ferried in rickety barges across Lake Rumare, she wondered how exactly did paladin Cyrille convince her to lead this display of "tactical ingenuity".\n\nOn paper, the plan seemed simple: bypass the riverline defences by going around them through the lake. Since the largest vessel one could find here was a fishing boat, there was no danger of being intercepted and sunk. Once they reached the shore, they would clash with the defenders while the rest of the paladins started their assault. Truly a ploy worthy of Cyrille!\n\nIn reality, she was dreading every upcoming moment. Yes, they trained this company in amphibious tactics, yes, they began this attack under the cover of night, but she feared something would happen, that would entirely ruin the surprise. And then she would have to die because honour demanded it. If only she got assigned to a more bureaucratic function instead of this.\n\n"Madame Keu? Captain? We've almost reached the shore." Her adjutant helpfully quipped. As if that was any comfort. Time to wear her bravest face she could muster.\n\n"Griffons! We are about to land! Ready your weapons and pray to the Gods for victory!"

Whereas other nobles liked precious metals and imported Macawian furniture, Cyrille's primary indulgence was his hoard of books. Some were historical treatises, but most were novels telling the outlandish stories of fictional knights (Vincent always found them to be ridiculous). And there was the griff in question, buried in a pile of literature, weakly sobbing. What could have driven such a brave paladin to tears?\n\n"What has come to you, Cyrille? Why are you crying in a pile of books?" Vincent suppressed the urge to ask if he got a papercut.\n\nThe stack moved briefly. "Oh hello, dearest sibling.

As the last foe crumpled into a heap from a hail of bullets, a moment of respite was earned.\n\nThe soldiers used the temporary lull to regroup and tend to their wounds. Cyrille wanted to rest, but he had to maintain their morale, giving hope to the broken. It didn't matter that he lost his helmet, or that blood trickled down from his forehead, and least of all that his armour was quite dented. Could not recall where he dropped the halberd, either.

erie_livio.1.d:0 "Eugénie Daguerre didn't give a flying feather about Vincent. He looked and acted the part of a pompous oaf, concerned only about his own benefit, and she had to wonder how did he keep his followers fighting for him after like what, 30 years? At least he had the sense to fear her. It was so obvious how he flinched and refused to even look in her direction. The only reason she took this job was for the sack of idols, and she owed Livio a favour. She missed their past days, with all the casual crime and violence.\n\nAfter the ponce and Livio finished discussing in hushed whispers, she was left together with the latter, who was quick to finish elaborating the details of her mission. If this Iovinus was also as arrogant as the griff who just left the room, then the world would be better off.\n\n"Livio, chéri, why do you work for that clown? You could slit his throat and be out of here before you know it." Eugénie reached for his claw, holding it tenderly.\n\n"He's as terrible as he looks, but the pay is good, and beats sitting in prison. Besides, after you get this done, I'll be free from the contract I have here. Then we can go back to doing what we enjoy most." They exchanged a mutual chuckle at the thought. "Now, shall we conclude our planning? The infiltration route is most important, you can't raise any suspicion before getting into position.""

What a dump this place was, she thought. No wonder it was becoming forgotten. If there was anygriff tracking her, they would have a difficult time keeping up. With a new identity, she would take a different ferry to Calembourg the next day. It felt even slower than the previous one, and Eugénie wondered if that loony griff that harassed her about building a tunnel under the lake had a good idea after all.\n\nThe so called beautiful city of Verenia was hardly worth its name. It was as if nothing was rebuilt in the last decade or two, but fortunately there were plenty of job openings for a "mercenary" she posed as. Specifically, with most of the soldiers sent to the frontline, griffs were needed to guard important places. With little questions asked, Eugénie became the newest member of the Ducal Militia.

The ponce seemed highly fond of his routine, rarely if ever deviating from it, but there would be an opportunity to make her move in three days.\n\nThe choice was binary: either she could accost Iovinus in a visit he was making to the local factory (ostensibly to raise morale), or she could simply wait for the cover of darkness and shank him while he's asleep.

Unfortunately, getting close to the Duke would not be easy due to her visibly armed state. Griffons are used to guns, but rulers wanted to be nowhere near them."

erie_livio.15.d:0 "After almost six months spent stealing resources from the targetted state, our operatives are no longer able to maintain their ruse.

erie_livio.16.d:0 "The Ducal Spymaster was rarely happy. Certainly, he could blame some of his woes on his actions, but the others were outside his control, and certainly not his fault. He didn't want to be one of those whiners who put blame against society, that was simply too pathetic. Nonetheless, Livio acknowledged that he was in a better position than ever.\n\nThe new quarters at the grand palace in Calembourg were more than satisfactory, but he didn't need it. What he wanted, and finally got, was the respect of his employer. Livio didn't delude himself: he knew very well that Vincent and the rest had no love for him, but they finally understood that his role was valuable. That made looking at the pile of papers on his new desk... slightly more bearable.\n\nNothing a stiff glass and a cigar couldn't make easier. Still, he missed the days where he wasn't bogged down in paperwork, and Livio very much wished he could go back to his old ways of stealing and swindling. At least he had minions for that sort of thing now, they'll get him something nice and shiny during their missions."

erie_livio.17.d:0 "The spymaster's operations have only increased in scope since the end of the Struggle. What were once humble rooms dedicated to an objectively insignificant task, now a whole section of the grand palace was dedicated to keeping tabs on both internal and external matters. Today, Vincent was summoned by the spymaster to one of these dark rooms, to discuss a matter of importance.\n\n"As you're aware, my Duke, foreign circumstances are rapidly becoming unfavourable for Verenia. Those with grand ambitions seek to reclaim their lost lands and heritage, and we're hardly going to be avoided by this... spectacle." Livio explained while pointing his claw at the most recent map of the continent. Vincent was certain the map was different from last month's, and wondered if the cartographers were making a fortune in redrawing them. Perhaps there was a quick idol to be made here...\n\n"Unfortunate, but expected. What could we possibly do about it?" Followed by a sigh of resignation.\n\n"Pray to your deity of choice, but you could place more resources into militarisation. Additionally, I have prepared infiltration groups against our largest rivals, but I can only coordinate one of them. Which one do you consider more pressing to address?" Vincent rested a cheek against his claw, peering in contemplation."

erie_livio.18.d:0 ""A week is a substantial amount of time, Sillègue. Can you not send some other griff to do the job for you?" While the Grand Duke gained more respect for the odious bird, he was still not keen on allowing tardiness. Unless, of course, it was him lounging around.\n\n"I've taken the lives of each and every griffon who was involved in the murder of my family, my Duke, and now I've finally tracked down their ringleader. This is very much personal, and I think you can understand the value of revenge given how far you've pursued yours." The spymaster was in no mood for jokes, and Vincent had to admit he wasn't wrong. Though he didn't really hate Iovinus... it was more of a means to an end, that being the rulership of Verenia.\n\n"Fine. Who is this miscreant you're seeking?" He leaned forward with his claws clasped together.\n\n"One Gontran Fauchet, if you must know. A former revolutionary, as well, so we have twice the reasons to pursue him." Nogriff he would miss, then.\n\n"I cannot condone murder in broad daylight, so I'll be coming with you, with a few paladins to arrest this rebel. He'll stand trial like the others." Shock danced across Livio's features, but he would begrudgingly acquiesce to this demand."

Next to him, the spymaster was broodingly quiet as he always was.\n\nInstructing the paladin chauffeurs to stay back, the pair would slowly approach the country home's front door. The building had clearly seen better days. "No violence, Sillègue." Vincent retorted as he knocked, and they waited for an answer. It would come in the form of locks being undone, and an elderly griffon peering through the entryway.\n\n"Who are you? I'm too old for the militia, leave me be!" He raised his claw to block the sun's rays, and to take a better look at them. "T-the Grand Duke?! H-here? Boreas have mercy, what have I done!"\n\n"Actually, I'm the one who's looking for answers. Are you Gontran Fauchet?" Livio interjected in the old loon's pleading, receiving a dumbstruck nod in return. "Pleased to meet you. This is for my family." Without any warning, he would pull out a revolver from his coat and shoot Gontran where he stood. Blood splattered both the Duke and the Spymaster, with the former loudly complaining about his clothing getting ruined as the latter already went back to the car."

She was clearly intimidated by their regal bearing and fine clothing. "My husband is out in the field, if you're looking for him." There was a tentative step back.\n\nSmoothly, Livio defused the awkward situation. "We're real estate appraisers, and we're looking for monsieur Fauchet, if you could be so kind to tell us where is he, madame...?"\n\n"Yvette. Unfortunately I do not know this Fauchet... Ah, forgive me! He was the one who sold us this parcel a year ago. Odd sort, we haven't seen him since then." Vincent peered to see that Livio's expression took the form of somegriff biting into a lemon. A few more questions were given, but nothing informative was learned.

Vincent was thoroughly unimpressed by his advisor's behaviour, and the sight haunted his dreams the past few days. Death was always more terrifying when it's three beaklengths away.\n\n"He was guilty, my Duke. We found the proof in his home and that sealed the deal. No need for courts and Grover's law, when my information turned out to be correct to the last dot. Truly, revenge solves everything." Livio was in a much more cheerful mood, Vincent had to admit, and it was rather uncanny. Was it psychotic glee, or just relief from having their woes put to rest?\n\n"Since arguing with you won't accomplish anything, I suggest we move on to the other topic. You've mentioned something about a project you were working on?" The Duke had a poor memory lately with everything he needed to recall.\n\n"Quite so. I've had some plans in mind to improve the sorry state of learning in this realm...""
erie_livio.20.d_norevenge:0 ""I felt that you were two pawsteps away from harming that peasant mare, Sillègue. At least she was kind enough to give us some freshly baked pastries." Vincent made sure to ask his personal chef to replicate that recipe.\n\n"How glad I am to hear that you were more concerned with confections than justice, my Duke." In truth, the Duke didn't see the Spymaster since they returned to Calembourg. Only now did he stumble out of his chambers. "Nonetheless, you turned out to be correct. Our quarry perished not too recently ago... but not by my claw. Not what I envisioned." The haggard look on Livio's face suggested he was heavily indulging in some unseemly activities.\n\n"All's well that ends well, is it not true? You've come very far in life while those miscreants met their ignoble ends. Now, will you finally elaborate on that project you told me before we left?" The Duke had a poor memory lately with everything he needed to recall.\n\n"I... suppose you're right. Not that it will ever stop bothering me. Moving on, I've had some plans in mind to improve the sorry state of learning in this realm...""

He had hoped to speak further with the Spymaster, but he angrily stomped away on their return, secluding himself in the lower chambers. Any attempts to make contact with Livio failed, so he focused on other, far more important things - like choosing the colour of his room's curtains. Iovinus had no style whatsoever.\n\nToday, however, Vincent was interrupted by a meek servant delivering a note. Not even sparing a glance for the peasant, he recognised the paper's form as one typically used by Livio. Quickly, he unravelled its contents.\n\n"My Duke,\nI have decided that our terms of employment are no longer satisfactory. Nonetheless, I am grateful for the support you've given me, so I've prepared a replacement spymaster for your needs, as well as a special project that should help you run this realm better.

"Eugénie, if the Du- sorry, 'Grand' Duke caught you here he would throw a tantrum and sic his paladins on you. But you were always the one for danger, weren't you?" This statement was entirely devoid of usual malice, as they shared together a fine dinner in one of the grand palace's side rooms.\n\nTo that she simply dismissed it with a wave of her claw. "Chéri, your Duke would start crying if I gave him a mean look, but I'll freely admit that I bungled up the job. Honest mistake, but all turned out well in the end, did it not?" She paused to savour the meal. "How are you enjoying the truffle macancini? At least he doesn't skimp out on paying his cooks."\n\nThose were truffles? Livio was certain he was biting into black trumpets. This "haute cuisine" nonsense only perplexed the spymaster. "It is wonderful, thank you. But yes, my position here has become slightly more tolerable and the nobles hate me slightly less, and I'm still unsure on the latter. Hard to believe I'm still alive, really." To that a wineglass was raised, the tannic contents being the few fancy things that did not confuse him.\n\n"And I'm very glad for you, Livio, but how long do you intend to stay here? Thought you were waiting for the first opportunity to scamper away, we have so many places to rob! You know, like in the good old days?" In truth while Livio was happy with the generous stipend Vincent gave him, he would have left already if he didn't have a... personal problem left to settle. But there was no need to bring it up to this moment of peace.\n\n"Worry not for me, Eugénie, we'll get there after I sort out some remaining issues. Let us enjoy this moment for now, and afterwards we'll go to the city, see what we can find." A roguish grin formed on her beak, and she raised her glass as well."
erie_livio.23.d_nowaifu:0 "Livio's mood had only mildly improved in recent times. If he knew how much work Vincent would pile onto him, perhaps he wouldn't have been so eager to accept the generous stipend offered. The rogue mind certainly loved having a large stash of money, but in truth Livio had rather few things to spend them on, since he pretty much lived in the Duke's house, wore the Duke's old clothes and ate the Duke's food...\n\nSpeaking of food, there he was holed in his office, lazily biting on a plate he had a colleague pass onto him. Livio rarely ventured where the nobles gathered, for he truly did not need any more scathing comments or cold glares, even if he could match their bite and return twice as much. What he truly needed was time to think on his own, and a comfortable stash of cigars to sate the addiction.\n\nIt hardly needed a leap of logic to realise, but the only reason Livio stayed was for the revenge he was still chasing after. Certainly, he could have done it on his own, yet Vincent's idols made the process smoother and easier. Yes, soon, very soon, the obsessive need will stop troubling him and he could finally put it all to rest. Before he could indulge the familiar train of thought, it was interrupted by a knock and a familiar figure barging in.\n\n"Livio, why are you hiding here again? Denys and I are going out to the city for some fun, you coming with us or what?" Goodgriff's sleazy visage offered little comfort, but a night out with him and the "Comte" would certainly be satisfying. "Oh, are those truffle macancini? You better not be getting too posh!"

erie_erilogue.6.d_no_revenge_stayed:0 "Livio Sillègue may have earned the begrudging respect of his employer, but he didn't find what he had sought after for decades: closure.\n\nThough he had avenged his family by killing most of their murderers, the fact that the last one slipped from his claws into peaceful death continued to bother him for quite some time. Much like a heist, it was all or nothing: vengeance needed to be thorough and complete.\n\nLivio's behaviour remained erratic for some time, but he continued to provide services to Verenia for many more years. The realm was orderly and secure, but mysterious disappearances continued. It seemed that it was either follow the law or face punishment — but the rules didn't apply for the watchgriffs."
erie_erilogue.6.d_revengeance:0 "Whichever griff said that revenge wasn't worth it was incredibly mistaken. For Livio Sillègue got everything he wanted.\n\nRespect, closure and enough idols to live like the proverbial king of Griffonstone. If his family could tell him how they felt, Livio was certain they would approve entirely. Blood called for blood, and now the debt was sated. So what if he had to commit so many heinous acts, burn so many bridges? The others respected and feared him. Nothing happening in Verenia was beyond his eyes and ears.\n\nVincent was not blind and noticed how his subordinate slowly grew more cruel, but he didn't want to become the next target of it. Fortunately for him, the spymaster had no plots to seize further influence — the power behind the throne was far more subtle, and less likely to be a target of reprisal."

erie_erilogue.7.d:0 "What more could be said? Could we discuss the lives of every griffon who did their part in the Verenian Struggle? It seems certain that it would be a waste of time, and those who failed to achieve their goals will not get a mention in the history books.\n\nThough peace in Griffonia was always fleeting, for a brief moment Verenia enjoyed theirs. Only the Gods know which thought, culture or griff would in the end shape the lives of millions, but whatever happened, they would have to contend with the nation that dated its origins from the first time griffons came down from the Hyperborean Mountains. An honour very few could claim in honesty."

erie_news.1.t:0 "The Unification Of Verenia"
erie_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The so-called Verenian Struggle has outlasted many conflicts that arose from the Republican Revolution of 978. Even as neighbouring regions settled into a pretence of peace, the infamously stubborn heirs of the late Verenian duke refused to lay down their weapons as battles and ceasefires followed one after another. Thus, the proudly independent region has only known strife for decades.\n\nYet to the surprise of many, the cycle of familial bloodshed has ended on this day. Despite the lack of foreign support, and dwindling resources, Vincent Erie has emerged victorious over his rivals and declared himself the undisputed ruler of Verenia. As the weary populace hopes to rebuild, the newly minted Grand Duke looks beyond his borders to secure himself a lasting reign."

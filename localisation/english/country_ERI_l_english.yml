#### FOCUS

ERI_whats_next:0 "Ending The Stalemate"
ERI_whats_next_desc:0 "Ceasefire has been maintained for the past four years, despite several incidents. The good Duke believes that the time is right to make a change in the status quo, based on the recent information received. Our struggle simply cannot continue, something has to change."
ERI_war_of_course:0 "The Usual Method"
ERI_war_of_course_desc:0 "Might makes right! The only proper way to end the Verenian Struggle after all these years is by force of arms and valour of soldiers. The peasants will be mobilised for the cause, whether they like it or not! A decisive victory will ensure there is no more question about who is the rightful ruler."
ERI_peace_maybe:0 "Give Peace A Chance"
ERI_peace_maybe_desc:0 "Perhaps the choices we've made haven't been the smartest ones. If our soldiers and shells haven't been able to bypass the Aranti riverline defences for so long, alternative options should be considered. The charming Duke should be able to easily convince his rivals into an agreement that benefits him most."
ERI_enforce_levy:0 "Serve Your Duke"
ERI_enforce_levy_desc:0 "Slugs! Worms! The time has come again to throw our great might against that perpetual thorn in our side, Iovinus. As per their obligations, the peasants must be rallied to the cause, armed and equipped to the fullest. They shall support our knights in a glorious charge, and there better be no talk about rights again."
ERI_emergency_conversion:0 "Emergency Production Expansion"
ERI_emergency_conversion_desc:0 "Firearms! Ordnance! Shovels! The soldiers of House Erie always require more equipment for the war effort. Several non-vital production centres will have to be forcibly converted to fulfill these requests, and the Duke will tolerate no delays in the matter."
ERI_up_the_taxes:0 "Increase Noble Obligations"
ERI_up_the_taxes_desc:0 "The Duke isn't one for two-faced behaviour, which is why the nobles sworn to his banner should contribute further for his future great victory. Increased taxes, length of field service and required griffonpower drawn from their ranks are required if we are to claim Verenia in the Duke's name."
ERI_fund_fabrice:0 "Invest In Research"
ERI_fund_fabrice_desc:0 "Fabrice Assaultine, the Duke's Grand Inventor, is a griffon of brilliant thoughts, and he has provided us a great plenty in new technologies and reverse-engineered foreign designs. Surely, we should invest a portion of our yearly income to his private business, so that we may further benefit from his breakthroughs?"
ERI_fund_livio:0 "Expand Information Network"
ERI_fund_livio_desc:0 "Livio Sillègue, although despised by many for his deceptive methods, has been invaluable in unconvering numerous plots from House Eyrie. If it weren't for his eyes and ears, we wouldn't have been prepared for numerous feints and ambushes. If his activities received more coin, then we could count on clearer information in the future."
ERI_mobilise_economy:0 "Necessary Sacrifices"
ERI_mobilise_economy_desc:0 "Nogriff is pleased to do it, but the honest truth is that we must be more conservative with our already limited resources. As much as possible should be diverted towards supporting the war effort, with the knowledge of our complete control of Verenia being our guiding light and motivation for enduring this hardship. One day, it will all be worth it."
ERI_noble_oaths:0 "Rally The Bannergriffs"
ERI_noble_oaths_desc:0 "The Midnight Banner does not stand on its own: the Duke's most loyal followers come from the lesser noble houses, such as the Bonbolet, De La Framboise, Des Groseilles, Du Poivrier and others. Following feudal obligations, they must contribute their household knights in the next assault against House Eyrie, and the Duke will fulfill his side of the arrangement, as agreed."
ERI_approve_plan:0 "Knight-Commander's Course Of Action"
ERI_approve_plan_desc:0 "We haven't fought a war for decades without learning anything. The Duke's esteemed brother, Cyrille, Comte d'Pont-aux-Griffes, has been working hard in hammering down a viable strategy that will allow us to break through the notoriously entrenched riverbank. There are no large scale fortifications owing to a lack of resources, yet the land is intensely difficult to advance through."
ERI_die_iovinus:0 "To End My Nemesis"
ERI_die_iovinus_desc:0 "The time is now! This is our moment of triumph! We shall march across the Aranti river and put an end to Iovinus' feeble schemes. Onwards to victory and glory, for the Duke! For Verenia!"
ERI_disarm:0 "Reducing Economic Mobilisation"
ERI_disarm_desc:0 "War creates much business, and it is great for innovation, but it certainly isn't good for the average griff who has to deal with a shortage of supplies and food. Restoring production to average consumer products should calm the masses, and show that their noble lords are most benevolent."
ERI_demobilise:0 "Sending The Soldiers Home"
ERI_demobilise_desc:0 "If we want to show that miser Iovinus that our intentions are genuine, then we must dismiss our forces from the payroll. Let the peasants return to their fields, and the foreign hirelings to return... to wherever they came from. If nothing else, the Duke's purse will get a lot heftier next month."
ERI_approach_for_negotiations:0 "Showing Sincerity"
ERI_approach_for_negotiations_desc:0 "The recent measures have certainly not gone unnoticed by House Eyrie, but the largest obstacle remains convincing them to attend the peace talks. It cannot be done through intermediaries - the two rival claimants must meet face to face if there is any hope of securing a lasting settlement."
ERI_plan_a:0 "Amicable Approach"
ERI_plan_a_desc:0 "Let bygones be bygones, yes? The Duke shall show his magnanimous side, forgive all past wrongs and slights, all for the benefit of peace. Surely, when faced with such abundant generosity, Iovinus will have no choice but to agree to everything we say? Vincent, you're so brilliant..."
ERI_plan_b:0 "Tepid Approach"
ERI_plan_b_desc:0 "There has been a lot of bad blood between Houses Erie and Eyrie. Nothing can change that, and nothing can bring back all the brave griffons who died for the cause. We've made the first move in extending a claw, but we expect Iovinus to show some good will and forgiveness of his own."
ERI_plan_c:0 "Aggressive Approach"
ERI_plan_c_desc:0 "Iovinus is but a weak, feeble minded simpleton. He's fallen right for my trap, and now we have him exactly where we wanted. A little blackmail here, and a little push there, and Verenia will be united with great amount of guile. I couldn't have thought of a better idea myself, and if Livio says it was his idea, he's lying!"
ERI_approach_avian:0 "Invite Katrina To Talks"
ERI_approach_avian_desc:0 "Who would have thought that the settlement process has gone far smoother than expected? A tentative agreement has been reached, but now we require the third party to join us. To complete the unification of Verenia, Lady Katrina must attend our peace talks. Given her soft nature, she is very unlikely to reject the idea."
ERI_end_to_the_war:0 "To End The Struggle"
ERI_end_to_the_war_desc:0 "The most incredible outcome! Nogriff believed it, but Duke Vincent has managed to outmanoeuvre his competitors, with both House Eyrie and House Avian agreeing to accept his compromises. After all these years, Verenia shall be united, led by the most competent successor!"

ERI_we_fucked_up_again:0 "The Fifth Ceasefire"
ERI_we_fucked_up_again_desc:0 "Amidst the confusion, chaos and revolt - once more, we are forced to settle for the most ignoble outcome - a bitter return to "peace". What good is this peace when it won't bring back the griffons who died, or fix the damage caused by uprisings? There can be no half-measures past this point: the next assault is our death, or glory. The Duke will be taking a personal claw in the matter."

ERI_the_yale_connection:0 "Fabrice's Connections"
ERI_the_yale_connection_desc:0 "For all the vexations the Grand Inventor causes to Erie's nobility, it cannot be denied that his research produces actual results. Thus, it would be prudent to check if the latest funding from the Duke's purse resulted in some tangible benefit for House Erie, that would allow us to make amends for the most recent setback."
ERI_invite_old_colleagues:0 "Alumni Of Yale"
ERI_invite_old_colleagues_desc:0 "Brilliance often comes with a disparaging attitude for authority and norms, it would seem. Indeed, it's become somewhat of a trend to hear of promising graduates from the universities of Yale, who end up forced to work far beneath their capabilities for one reason or another. Fabrice has been wondering if some of these old colleagues could be invited here."
ERI_the_golden_mean:0 "Responsible Research"
ERI_the_golden_mean_desc:0 "The Duke holds great fondness for his Grand Inventor, but he realises that House Erie is on a tight budget. It would bring Verenia further glory to be the place of a new scientific revolution, but those are currently distant dreams. Fabrice will have to work with what can be spared."
ERI_no_limits_go_brrrrr:0 "Limits (And Ethics) Be Damned"
ERI_no_limits_go_brrrrr_desc:0 "Progress is a constant that is always sought after, yet never fully in reach. Why should we restrain ourselves in pursuit of victory? Anything and everything must be done to ensure we have an edge over our rivals. The Grand Inventor will have everything he desires, but there will be a strict deadline to ensure our investment comes to a satisfying conclusion."
ERI_tech_for_people:0 "Share The Progress"
ERI_tech_for_people_desc:0 "Who said we aren't generous overlords? Scientific discoveries are meant to be distributed far and wide, to inspire awe and fear! For now, we'll have to think a little smaller. Fabrice has taken a small break from his daydreaming, to write up a coherent program for teaching the masses. Of course, nothing dangerously thought provoking, just the basic things everygriff should know. Such as, respect your leaders."
ERI_licences:0 "Foreign Designs"
ERI_licences_desc:0 "Our goals would be far easier if the majority of arms dealers and banks across Griffonia didn't refuse to work with us. Boreas, it's not our fault we can't pay our debts on time, we're fighting a war! However, there is an alternative: bypassing private enterprises and working directly with a foreign government. There must be somegriff in the Aquileian mainland that will heed the plea of its distant relatives."
ERI_grand_experiment:0 "Spark Of Ingenuity"
ERI_grand_experiment_desc:0 "Numbers and stategies mean little when one side has a decisive technological advantage. Having worked for a long time on his most bold and audacious project thus far, the Grand Inventor has a proposal for the Duke that he'll find very difficult to refuse. Previous small scale demonstrations have been promising, now all that's needed is commitment and no small amount of resources."

ERI_indominable_spirit:0 "Hoist The Standard High"
ERI_indominable_spirit_desc:0 "The Midnight Banner has been bloodied, but not broken! We shall regroup, we shall come together, we shall never yield! Losses will be replaced, training shall resume in the earnest, the House of Erie shall fall only once when the last paladin perishes! Let us see to our preparations, lest our great Duke grows further displeased."
ERI_weed_out_the_weak:0 "Balancing The Needs"
ERI_weed_out_the_weak_desc:0 "Domestic economy is largely undefined and left to the whims of lesser nobles. As long as their estates and properties were managed sufficiently enough for the taxes, the Duke didn't really involve himself in the matter. However, this was always intended as a temporary measure until Verenia was united, and now we should make the first step in solving this problem."
ERI_bone_for_plebs:0 "Ease Up On The Peasants"
ERI_bone_for_plebs_desc:0 "The good people are tired of war and its endless provisions, which is all fair and fine, if we weren't pressed for every claw to our service. Recent instability, however, has shown that some wishes need to be fulfilled. For the time being, our gentler side will be shown to the masses, but we'll make up for the losses through other means."
ERI_fires_of_war:0 "Expand The Requirements"
ERI_fires_of_war_desc:0 "It. Is. Not. Enough. The good people may becry our choices, but no conflict was won through pleasant words and comfortable indulgences. Everygriff that can be pressed into some kind of service - they will be pressed, and hard! All unneeded frivolities shall be cut down upon, as well. The greatest force Verenia has ever seen will be brought through our sacrifice."
ERI_hedge_knights:0 "Wandering Soldiers"
ERI_hedge_knights_desc:0 "War isn't waged just for pride and prestige. Rather, some unscrupulous individuals fight for the thrill of battle, and the promise of payment. Such was the case when the old Empire broke, leaving many armed griffs without employment. Now, a band of these desperate stragglers make their way to the Court of Erie, seeking a patron willing to fill their pockets."
ERI_new_blood:0 "Fresh Recruits"
ERI_new_blood_desc:0 "They could not have been ready in time for the last assault, but the newest regiments have been trained to the standards set by our illustrious Knight-Commander. After a short ceremony for the newly minted paladins, they shall take their place among their comrades-in-arms. Hope they will be enough to overcome the difficult situation ahead of us."
ERI_relief_fund:0 "Carrot And Stick"
ERI_relief_fund_desc:0 "The virtues of nobility are exemplified by their treatment of the lesser and less fortunate classes. It is our humble obligation to provide for them, as they shall in return provide service and obedience. Should they act unruly, however, our generosity will have to be cut short. Let us hope they see the facts of life."
ERI_discipline:0 "Standards Of Paladins"
ERI_discipline_desc:0 "A paladin fights not only for their lord, but also their homeland, friends, families and more. Reminding our brave soldiers of their noble causes should inspire them to give their fullest effort in the coming battle. There can be no other choice."
ERI_ride_for_glory:0 "Bravery, Temerity, Dignity, Guide Us!"
ERI_ride_for_glory_desc:0 "A righteous cause is always worth fighting and dying for. A day may come when the bravery of griffon knights fails, but it is not this day. Embrace your closest, say goodbye to your children, for today, we march against immeasurable odds - and we shall be victorious! Advance against the world's ruin, for greatness has not yet perished, glory and courage! For our beautiful Verenia!"

ERI_cloak_and_dagger:0 "Livio's Machinations"
ERI_cloak_and_dagger_desc:0 "Nogriff really knows how far the spymaster's schemes go. Not even he is aware of every agent or criminal in his service, for he works through many proxies and intermediaries. Disorganised as it seems, it is ultimately to our benefit, as he is able to provide us with goods and information we couldn't seize through legitimate means."
ERI_expand_agency:0 "Increase Subterfuge Capabilities?"
ERI_expand_agency_desc:0 "The spymaster has been grumbling about his inadequate options concerning his role for quite some time. Livio is doing his work as best as he possibly can, but the few rooms given to him in the Château's east wing are reaching their limits. He has expressed a desire to have a more independent agency, suited for his needs."
ERI_infiltrate_the_hof:0 "Happy Little Accidents"
ERI_infiltrate_the_hof_desc:0 "A state consists of many parts, from its leader to the lowliest of clerks fetching paperwork. Far more than most realise, these "lowly" griffs are perhaps crucial to the wellbeing of a community, office or factory floor. If some of these were to disappear quietly, our infiltrators would have an easier time putting a wrench in their production plans."
ERI_sleepers_everywhere:0 "Revolutions Without Cause"
ERI_sleepers_everywhere_desc:0 "It is no secret that the peasantry has been griping about the conditions on both sides of the Aranti river. Why wouldn't they? Living conditions have steadily deteriorated over the years, trust in leadership has never been lower. Which is precisely what we can exploit to spread some unrest in Iovinus' holds."
ERI_among_the_people:0 "The Magnanimous Duke"
ERI_among_the_people_desc:0 "Sometimes, even great and wise leaders have to make appearances in public, to persuade their underlings that they ostensibly care about them. It is also an opportunity to lessen some wrongs, show a generous side, and much more! The question is, will the Duke deign to appear for the rabble, or will he rather stay at home?"
ERI_selective_destruction:0 "Misery Makes Great Company"
ERI_selective_destruction_desc:0 "Preparation is the most important part of any plan, and what better way to amplify our chances of success than to ruin theirs? Subverting House Eyrie at their every move will help out the ducal soldiers, especially when they notice that their foe has been waylaid, or greatly lacking in supplies."
ERI_the_job:0 "Most Dangerous Game"
ERI_the_job_desc:0 "For the past decades, war has been waged countless times, and uneasy peace followed each time, in a most vicious cycle of misery that's left both griffon and nature scarred. We have not fought to destroy Verenia, but to liberate it! The Ducal Spymaster has arranged through his contacts a most devious solution that will end the problem.\nPermanently."

ERI_duke_of_victory:0 "The Duke Of Victory"
ERI_duke_of_victory_desc:0 "By the Three above! At long last, the epic Struggle for Verenia has concluded, and it is our side that emerged triumphant! The banners of false claimants Eyrie and Avian have been cast to the ground, and we must make haste to ensure our hold on the region is secured. First order of priority: remind the subjects who's in charge now."

ERI_deal_with_katrina:0 "Amelinda's Heir"
ERI_deal_with_katrina_desc:0 "Unbeknownst to us all, Katrina and her supporters have been imprisoned since her foolish attempt to broker peace between the Houses failed. Her supposedly loyal commanders have seized control of her holdings, and tried to seize Verenia while we were celebrating our success! They have been dealt with, but the question of what to do with her remains."
ERI_appease_peasants:0 "Distribute Amenities"
ERI_appease_peasants_desc:0 "The Struggle was never popular with the lower classes, that much is obvious, but our forces are stretched thin trying to quell riots and silly ideas of "communism". It seems that Iovinus and Katrina were also not that good at keeping the masses content, so to that end we'll show how great we are by giving them what they want: bread and entertainment."
ERI_loser_faggot_iovinus:0 "Seal Iovinus' Fate"
ERI_loser_faggot_iovinus_desc:0 "This particular vengeance has been a long time in making; the dastardly adversary has been caught and lies imprisoned in the dungeons, awaiting his rightful punishment. Although some have desired a public trial, Vincent has rebuked any and all ideas of such: he will personally decide what happens to Iovinus Eyrie."

ERI_praise_the_advisor:0 "The Duke's Most Favoured"
ERI_praise_the_advisor_desc:0 "Many can be praised for their contribution in ending the Struggle, but there is one griff who perhaps deserves the most praise of all. The Grand Duke is most generous to those who have served above and beyond their calling, and they shall be most handsomely rewarded for their efforts."

ERI_rebuilding_calembourg:0 "Rebuilding Verenia"
ERI_rebuilding_calembourg_desc:0 "Weep for our beautiful country! So despoiled and ruined after years and years of fighting. We must get to work and start reconstructing Verenia one brick at a time. We shall start from Calembourg, make it worthy of its epithet again, and from there, it shall spread to all corners of this land. The petty people shall know the benevolence of our Grand Duke!"
ERI_disband_militias:0 "Send The Peasants Home"
ERI_disband_militias_desc:0 "The war is over, and thus we have no more need for hastily raised peasant militias. Let them tend to their fields and families, and grant the most distinguished fighters some sort of reward, too. More importantly, we need to work on restoring the many verdant fields of gold Verenia is known for, so that everygriff can have a full plate on their tables."
ERI_solving_illiteracy:0 "Teaching The Populace Something Useful"
ERI_solving_illiteracy_desc:0 "There is no shortage of cheap, uneducated labour in Verenia, but their usage has its limits. Thus, the good-for-nothing subjects have to be taught some actual skills, like mathematics, management, and others, so that we may extract further benefits from the fruits of their efforts. Of course, it must be firmly established that the social structure is here to stay."
ERI_putting_eggheads_to_work:0 "So They Will Work Better For Us"
ERI_putting_eggheads_to_work_desc:0 "Anygriff can build a house; four walls, a ceiling and a roof. Good enough for a filthy peasant, but not good enough for the Grand Duke! We require our best architects and construction workers to build factories, housing, administrative complexes, anything needed, of high quality to last the test of time. Let the people feel pride as they see these aesthetic buildings."
ERI_cleaning_the_river:0 "Cleaning The Aranti Riverbanks"
ERI_cleaning_the_river_desc:0 "The grand Aranti, which has served Verenia so well in the past by giving us control of important trade routes, is in a less than desirable state. With so many trenches, wreckages, and decaying corpses on both sides of the river, it resembles something from the mind of Maar, rather than natural beauty. It needs to be restored, the land providing its bounty once more."
ERI_expanding_mines:0 "Exploit Verenian Riches"
ERI_expanding_mines_desc:0 "Most of the country is known for its flowing plains full of arable land, but the rather sparse rough terrain is surprisingly abundant in mineral goods. Prospectors were only able to discover and exploit a limited amount due to the single-minded focus on war, but now we have the means and options to fully explore what lies beneath the ground."
ERI_science_stuff_1:0 "Establish A Statewide Curriculum"
ERI_science_stuff_1_desc:0 "There are many things worth knowing in this world, but what exactly is worth learning is a matter of debate. Useful information, certainly, but it is up to us to decide what constitutes such and how it shall be taught among the masses. Most importantly, the evils of Marksism and Kemerskainism will be strictly kept out of any books in this country..."
ERI_increase_development:0 "Catching Up"
ERI_increase_development_desc:0 "Attempts to keep up with latest industrial developments has largely been stymied by lack of resources and investment. Some, like the Grand Inventor, have successfully modernised their production methods on a small, local scale. Progress needs to be brought to Verenia, and quickly, lest our reputation of a backwater province grows even worse."
ERI_improve_infra:0 "All Roads Lead To Calembourg"
ERI_improve_infra_desc:0 "Much can be said about the road quality in Verenia, and very few of it would be good. Lack of maintenance has led to severe infrastructure degradation, leading to them being barely suitable for a farmer's cart. To accomodate the transport of goods and materials, not to mention the increased usage of vehicles like automobiles and trucks, the roads must be fixed and expanded."
ERI_fix_railroads:0 "Repair Bridges And Railroads"
ERI_fix_railroads_desc:0 "Railways have been used extensively in the Struggle to move griffs and equipment, but every connection across the Aranti river has been destroyed for obvious reasons. Alongside the general disrepair of these links, it has become a pressing concern to repair them for civilian purposes. What better way to symbolise the unification of Verenia than building bridges?"
ERI_science_stuff_2:0 "Reopen The Calembourg University"
ERI_science_stuff_2_desc:0 "Calembourg is no Yale, but its learning institutions were the best Verenia could offer. Many were regrettably closed during the past decades due to conscription and slashed budgets, but now we have the means and responsibility to offer everygriff a place for advanced learning. Not only will it prevent further exodus of bright minds, but it will allow us to propagate proper thinking."
ERI_modern_verenia:0 "A Verenia We Can All Be Proud Of"
ERI_modern_verenia_desc:0 "While Verenia will never be on par with industrial giants such as Griffenheim, Aquila or even Skyfall, there is something that can be said about what we've accomplished in such a short time. The lowly complaints have mostly been silenced, and life is slowly returning to the good old days before 978. Yes, things shall be good from now on, peaceful and unchanging..."

ERI_dukes_favourite_egghead:0 "Fabrice's Brilliance"
ERI_dukes_favourite_egghead_desc:0 ""See, mon Duc? My doubters have decisively been proven as incorrect complainers, whereas I was the strong voice of reason. Without my brilliant invention, we'd still be stuck on the wrong side of the river! If you'd allow me, I have plenty of ideas and plans on how to make Verenia grand again...""
ERI_more_experiments:0 "Increasing Experiment Scopes"
ERI_more_experiments_desc:0 ""It's a shame science is so costly, but there can't be progress without sacrifice, you know? If you would be so kind to sign a few laws, and grant these funds, we'd catch up to the established powers in no time! I can't guarantee success in every venture, though. Innovation is a fickle business.""
ERI_avault_expansions:0 "An Avault In Every City"
ERI_avault_expansions_desc:0 ""Ateliers Avault is not exactly a business in the traditional sense of the word... alright, it is, but I don't bother too much with the paperwork and bills. I have griffs who take care of the uninteresting parts while I focus on what's most important. Still, expanding my venture across the river would increase the options at our disposal... May I count on some subsidies for a smoother growth cycle?""
ERI_the_nuclear_proposal:0 "The Atom And Its Potential"
ERI_the_nuclear_proposal_desc:0 ""Mon Duc, there are things around us that we cannot see. No, I'm not talking about spies. There are forces of nature, of such destructive power that anything we currently wield seem like gnats in comparison. This is a very costly endeavour, but there is something you might be very interested in having...""
ERI_noble_reward:0 "Rewarding A Friend And Colleague"
ERI_noble_reward_desc:0 ""When I came to Verenia all these years ago, I didn't think I'd be staying for very long. By that point, I've crossed over half of Griffonia, but I didn't expect myself to find such charming company, and not to mention all this encouragement for my craft. I'm not sure how to properly express my gratitude - yes, even the bookworm doesn't have an answer to everything, hah!""

ERI_spoils_of_war:0 "Distribute Eyrian Holdings"
ERI_spoils_of_war_desc:0 "Despite the Sunlight Shield being broken, most nobles that served Iovinus have refused to serve the Grand Duke. Thus they've met their ignoble ends alongside their liege lord. The few who submitted will be allowed to keep their holdings, but the property of the dead will be granted to the noble houses who have loyally served the Midnight Banner."
ERI_a_trip_to_france:0 "Our Aquileian Kin"
ERI_a_trip_to_france_desc:0 "Verenia is not alone in the world, in spite of what some say. Whereas previously most powers ignored the Struggle, now they must contend with the united region. Making foreign contacts is a beginning, but more importantly, we should find a protector. We hold much cultural and historical ties with Aquileia, making them a good starting point."
ERI_feudalism_for_today:0 "Modern Day Feudalism"
ERI_feudalism_for_today_desc:0 "The lessers serve their betters, this is how it always was, and always will be. Regardless of what some lunatics squatting in distant north say, nobility and stratification of society is here to stay. However, the system needs to adapt to changing circumstances, but to what degree it shall change remains to be seen."
ERI_pay_denbts_to_flowena:0 "[Root.GetPayDenbtsToFlowenaFocusName]"
ERI_pay_denbts_to_flowena_default:0 "Pay Debts To Flowena"
ERI_pay_denbts_to_flowena_alternate:0 "Fiscal Responsibility And Solvency"
ERI_pay_denbts_to_flowena_desc:0 "[Root.GetPayDenbtsToFlowenaFocusDesc]"
ERI_pay_denbts_to_flowena_default_desc:0 "In our efforts to seize Verenia, we've run up a considerable debt to the banks of Flowena, which has resulted in them refusing to deal with us. Worse yet, they've informed every other major and minor bank on the continent, leaving us with so little ways to gain capital. With so many riches seized, we can now afford to repay the debt. With interest."
ERI_pay_denbts_to_flowena_alternate_desc:0 "There has been considerable debate after our glorious victory what to do with the debt we've run up with Flowena over the years.\nNot anymore! The vulture bankers have gone bust and so have their ledgers. With that in mind, we have cut down on unnecessary expenditures, and soon we can trade with the wider world with confidence."
ERI_peace_in_our_time:0 "Promising Peace"
ERI_peace_in_our_time_desc:0 "Although the most recent war has mostly left cities and villages undamaged, the lowly people are still very much tired of fighting. As we have no claims beyond Verenia, and wish only to rule these lands in perpetuity, the Grand Duke has no qualms by promising the peasants that there will be peace in our time. There will still be a need for a defence force, though."
ERI_benevolent_autocracy:0 "The Role Of Nobles"
ERI_benevolent_autocracy_desc:0 "The Grand Duke has treated his subjects well, and they have been rewarded with new titles, holdings and other privileges for their boundless loyalty. However, now that there is less of a need for a constant war economy, life turning to the slow and uneventful day to day management of a nation, perhaps the old contract could be renegotiated to some extent."
ERI_looking_for_friends:0 "Look To The Périphérie"

ERI_fancy_ordnance:0 "The Ducal Artillery Division"
ERI_fancy_ordnance_desc:0 "Current estimation predicts any future war in Verenia will be a defensive one, and our geography mostly consists of plains.

Warfare has changed and no longer relies on individual bravery, but closely knit forces that rely on each other to achieve success in the field. Our forces could use many more engineers, scouts, field medics, and others, but they require specialised training first."

It is noted that without his brilliant tactical leadership, House Erie would have long perished, and it is thanks to Cyrille that the cities of Pont-aux-Griffes and Erie resisted three sieges over the course of ten years. The tale many recount at outings is one at the second siege of Pont-aux-Griffes, where the Comte held the bridge with a small group of paladins against a vastly superior Eyrian force.\n\nIn spite of his almost legendary exploits, Cyrille remains unclouded from delusions of grandeur. His sole commitment remains the furthering the cause of his liege lord, distancing himself from the politicking and schemes in the Ducal Court. When it comes to management and paperwork, Cyrille usually delegates the responsibility, preferring to concentrate on his training. Regardless of his immense propaganda value, the Comte continues to charge headlong into the next battle, leaving the troops under his command to wonder if he has a suppressed death wish, or simply vicious bloodthirsty tendencies.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!: KaiserSauce"

Such was the case with Livio Sillègue - coming from a family of vintners who made good trading in Vinovia. In a happy tale, they would have prospered and remained satisfied, if not for an ultimately unfortunate trip to the Périphérie in pursuit of a market expansion. Caught in the revolution's outbreak, they were targetted by insurgents mistaking them for nobles due to their opulent outlook. Livio was the only one who survived the massacre. Clawing his way out of the caravan with little more than his clothing and a few idols, he was not seen or heard for many years.\n\nIt is unknown what he did to survive, but Livio would eventually find himself locked in Château Erie's deepest dungeons, wanted for several charges of murder, arson, robbery and other heinous crimes. Execution was certain, if not for an offer from Vincent himself: put his underground connections to the cause of House Erie, or face oblivion. It was an open secret that Livio was hunting down the perpetrators of the worst day in his life, and to that end, he became quite skilled in collecting information (though he mostly used it for satisfying violent outbursts). Unwilling to forsake his revenge, he would take on the Duke's offer, much to the dismay of his fellow courtiers, forced to put up with a criminal only barely adhering to the proper decorum.\n\n"

duke_erie_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 25th of September, 954 in Calembourg\n§YTitle§!: Duc d'Erie\n\n§YBiography§!: As the wealth and splendour of Verenian dukes grew, so too did the size of their family. The children and siblings of the ruling duke would vie for favour, seeking to inherit the largest share of the estates, for under the old style of griffon inheritance, those not in the direct line of succession would receive a pittance, not enough to sustain a comfortable lifestyle as expected of noblegriffs. Thus it led to the creation of the cadet branch of noble House Erie, which would sustain the excess members of the senior line from House Eyrie. This arrangement was a mostly satisfying one, at least until the revolution of 978.\n\nThe most senior member of House Erie left after the Republicans butchered most of his family, Vincent seemingly embodies the traditional noble qualities which led to such dissatisfaction: arrogance, hedonism and scant concern for his servants. This is not helped further by the fact that he has rebelled against the established order of succession, which states that House Eyrie has priority for the Verenian throne. But those close to Vincent would confirm his eloquence and learned mind, exceptional generosity to griffons who have served him well, and above all, an unshakeable desire to see Verenia flourish like in the times of old. Some even say that he can be very charming when it suits him, though Vincent has yet to secure marriage even after he passed 50 years of age.

duke_erie_gen_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 25th of September, 954 in Calembourg\n§YTitle§!: Duc d'Erie\n\n§YBiography§!: As the wealth and splendour of Verenian dukes grew, so too did the size of their family. The children and siblings of the ruling duke would vie for favour, seeking to inherit the largest share of the estates, for under the old style of griffon inheritance, those not in the direct line of succession would receive a pittance, not enough to sustain a comfortable lifestyle as expected of noblegriffs. Thus it led to the creation of the cadet branch of noble House Erie, which would sustain the excess members of the senior line from House Eyrie. This arrangement was a mostly satisfying one, at least until the revolution of 978.\n\nAs a griff who was far from the line of succession before the tragic events, Vincent has received only the most basic of military education. Green and rash, he would prefer to learn directly from experience than heeding his tutors and teachings, before ultimately relenting that he is not at all suited for the task. While the self-styled Duc d'Erie holds the final word on decisions, in practice his knightly subordinates manage independently the gritty business of warfare.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

#### EVENTS

erie.1.t:0 "An Introduction To A Sordid Tale"
erie.1.d:0 "My name is Vincent, the true duke of Verenia. For decades, I've waged a war of unmatched ferocity and fervour over these lands against my accursed half-brother, Iovinus, the false duke. In the past, our ancestors have ruled Verenia and its lush plains, lucrative river trade routes and splendid cities, whose grandeur only increased after we swore fealty to the rising Groverian Empire. However, everything changed after those filthy, uppity revolutionaries tore through the region, and left most of my family hanging on trees, including poor father. With the line of succession unclear, and my vacuous brother unwilling to submit, there was no choice but to fight for the title.\n\nAlas, victory was within my grasp, if it weren't for that trollop Amelinda, who absconded with a sizeable portion of my property and soldiers. The endless stalemate developed, and Verenia fell behind in terms of development and population. Indeed, I've even heard that in distant corners of Griffonia, they make jokes of two dunderhead dukes fighting over worthless rocks. To this I say, nay! They do not realise the beauty of this land, which I dearly love with all my heart. I'd love nothing more to see it restored to what it once was, even if in the end I'm forced to submit to some other rising tyrant.\n\nFortunately, my few and faithful retainers (the same cannot be said about the worthless peasants who keep complaining) work tirelessly in achieving the noble goal. Alongside the noble families who are sworn to the Erian Midnight Banner, the most notable griffons in this House are my biological younger brother Cyrille (who in spite of his stuffy attitude, he is a very brave and capable commander), a brilliant mind named Fabrice (provides me with new inventions and drinking company on weekends) and Livio, the court rat (his schemes have not always produced the required information, but he is too valuable to dispose of).\nThese are my capabilities, and I shall stop at nothing to achieve my rightful claim to the throne."
erie.1.a:0 "Let us finish this, once and for all."

erie.2.t:0 "Cyrille's Grand Plan"
erie.2.d:0 ""To conclude, gentlegriffs, our strategy concerns itself primarily with the capture of fortress Eyrie. Paladins will lead multiple assaults over the riverfront, with concentrated artillery strikes at their weakest defences, while I shall hold the elite knights in reserve, ready to strike once their soldiers move to support northward. With the capture of their main fortification, nothing shall stand in our way to force them in a most inglorious surrender." Peered over an extensive map of the Aranti river, Knight-Commander Cyrille of the Erian Household Guard finished his proposal. "Are there any questions?"\n\nShuffling in their chairs, his subordinates, as well as his liege lord, Vincent of Erie, seemed satisfied with the proposal. Lacking other options, everygriff wanted nothing more that a swift conclusion to the decades of warfare - in their favour, of course. Yet doubting thoughts did not yield so easily, as one of the paladins spoke.\n\n"The ruse is too obvious, they won't weaken their defence lynchpin, even if we committed entirely. Iovinus gains nothing from moving off that hill, and might simply launch his own counterattack once we broke through the riverline. And what of Lady Katrina? Will she stand idly once again, or has she plotted something nefarious?"\n\nJust so, the illusion of confidence cracked. Nogriff wanted another folly from 3 years ago. Much has been invested since that time, in both research and information gathering, and who could say how much more could the status quo endure? Options were weighted, forces were adjusted, and in the end, an effective compromise was reached.\n\nAs always, it would just have to do. Honour and duty demanded it."
erie.2.a:0 "We hold faith in the valour of our soldiers, and the skill of our leaders."

erie.3.t:0 "Yet Another Setback"
erie.3.d:0 "This was going to be the day. This was it! The culmination of his efforts and desires! Vincent Erie would have his vengeance, and all of Verenia would finally be his. Confidently strutting in his workroom, the only thing left to do was await the arrival of an herald proclaiming victory.\n\nAnd not a moment too soon, there was already a knock on the door, followed by a frightened-looking messenger carrying multiple envelopes. "Ah, servant! Has the battle gone well? Is that cur Iovinus finally in a cage where he belongs? Give me the news now!" Alas, the retainer was too cowed by his superior leadership skills and could only meekly deliver his missives. Wasting little time, the Duke tore off seals from letters and began reading.\n\n"Peasant revolts... front broken... full retreat ordered... truce declared?!"\n\nThe shocking turnabout was too much for the Duke to handle, furiously throwing the papers into the fireplace, followed by slamming his claws on his prized mahogany table. This could not stand. He has waged an epic campaign of warfare and leisure, and his idiotic, pathetic excuse of a brother refused to give in! There could be no more half-measures. Remembering that the peasant griffon was still sharing his quarters, he issued a quick and imposing bark, as befitting a griffon of his stature and authority:\n\n"Servant! Bring everygriff who matters to these chambers, now."\n"W-which ones, my liege?"\nOh how the Duke hated incompetence. "Every. Single. One. The Knight-Commander, the Spymaster, the Grand Inventor, the paladins in the field who aren't dead or dying, anygriff who does something in the court! Now get moving before I cut your wages!"\nSatisfied that his unquestionable supremacy sent the lowly servant to a dart, Vincent moved to his comfortable resting chair to formulate the next course of action. And of course, the scoldings he would give to his underlings."
erie.3.a:0 ""Can't anygriff do anything right?!""

erie.4.t:0 "The Faults In Our Actions"
erie.4.d:0 ""Well, everygriff? All of you have assured me that we were prepared, that this time for sure, House Eyrie would be trampled under our assault. Yet, we are undone because of what, a few peasant riots? I hope there's a very good explanation for this."\nJust like that, murmurs ceased, replaced with an uncomfortable silence, only interrupted by the ticking of an imported Macawian clock. It would have gone on for quite some time, if the bold knight didn't step in to the fray.\n\n"My liege, please, do not blame your brave soldiers. We all fought gloriously, spurred on by a righteous cause, but we were undermined by circumstances not within our control. Namely, the rat Livio provided us with faulty information! Pluck his feathers and flog him!"\nAmusing how the supposed icon of chivalry didn't see himself above passing the guilt, and with that, the cacophony was released.\n"My fault? It's not my fault your featherbrain can't read simple reports! Maybe you should slam your head on the wall less!"\n"House Bonbolet was always your favourite, my lord! Please forgive us!"\n"I say we teach the peasants a lesson! Torch their houses and fields!"\n"Does anygriff have spare bandages?! I beg you, Lothaire got shot in the wing!"\n"Fools! While you argue like ponies, Iovinus only gains! It won't be long before he burns down Château Erie!"\n\nSpoiled, insipid children. Vincent had to act before it came to blows and scrapes. With a mighty bellow that silenced the lesser underlings, he would cow them all into submission.\n"I do not care whose fault is it, because it is clear and obvious, all of you have failed in some manner. You will return to your posts, fix your egregious mistakes, and then we can do this properly. By Eyr, we've been stuck at this for over 30 years, you'd think we'd accomplish something right by this point. Now...""
erie.4.a:0 ""Out! All of you, begone!""

erie.5.t:0 "Workshop Of Wonders"
erie.5.d:0 "The sting of failure still lingered in Vincent's mind, but it was best not to dwell on it for too long. After all, he spent the previous two days indulging in the contents of his wine cellar, where a particular Francistrian vintage caught his attention. Now, the time is right to get back to work, and pay a visit to his most trusted servants. Taking a more personal claw in the matter will ensure nothing's left to chance next time.\n\nMilling through the streets of Erie (the Duke had a little internal giggle each time he reminded himself of the city's egotistic naming), Vincent would make his way to the local branch of Ateliers Avault. No doubt, Fabrice was well on his way towards discovering an ingenious weapon that would smite Iovinus to scorching pieces! Or more likely, nursing a hangover from last night.\n\nWhat he didn't expect, as he entered into the workshop's main hall, was an arc of lightning striking not even an arm's length away from him! Vincent briefly felt his life instantly passing over his eyes, with a scattered prayer to Eyr, until his stupor was interrupted by the familiar smooth voice, slowly gaining in closeness.\n\n"Apologies, mon Duc! What you've just witnessed is my latest and greatest creation! It came onto me in a dream, no doubt granted by Boreas Himself! Still a work in progress, though..."\n"Aaaaaaah... Fabrice! What have I told you about safety measures? I could have been seriously hurt!"\nIf the brilliant inventor seemed phased, he didn't quite show it. "Nonsense, friend! I'm not much for medical science, but I'm sure I would have been able to treat any... non-serious wounds. That's the best I could promise. Now then, what is the purpose of my Duke's visit to this humble shrine of science? It's far too early for leisure, is it not?"\nOh yes, Vincent would have loved some casual games accompanied by imported Skyfall whiskey and cigars. But later on that, this time he meant business. "Not now, Fabrice, but I do have something most excellent to show you for that time. I'm here to discuss our immediate plans for House Erie and how your work should fit into it. May we speak in privately?"\nInstructing his workers to take care of the machinery, the loyal servant would guide his employer through the maze-like hallways. "I was certain we would triumph this time, but fortune did not favour us. I've been working on something to even the odds, but we need more of your generous investments...""
erie.5.a:0 ""Your clever mind has rarely failed to deliver, dear friend.""

erie.6.t:0 "Less Visited Corridors"
erie.6.d:0 "Vincent didn't quite understand what Fabrice explained to him over charts and diagrams, but it certainly seemed flashy! Though, he'd have to decide if he really wanted to fund this escapade, the last one did not end particularly well for anygriff involved... and that poor pony. Shaking his head to dispel a haunting memory, the Duke was quick to return to his estates.\n\nInteracting with that criminal Sillègue was never pleasant, but it was necessary, he was quick to remind himself. Vincent would find Livio sequestered in the château's east wing, far from any noble company (who despised the griff on principle). Ignoring the shady figures who passed so often beside him, informants probably, the Spymaster's hideout contrasted sharply to the workshop he just left. Meticulously ordered and devoid of gaieties, the room was dominated by endless stacks of papers, several boards hanging from walls which contained pinned notes and photographs. The griffon behind all of this seemed to brood in his chair, sharpening his claws with a knife.\n"Ah... my Duke. Are you here about the recent failures? I assure you, I've done my work as you requested."\nVincent was not feeling eager to get in the range of that dagger, so he stayed put at the doorway. "Partially. Was it true what Cyrille said, that you've given them false information?"\n"That bird couldn't tell day or night apart once he's high on his knightly mania. We captured some fools across the river and interrogated them, as usual."\nAs usual, yes. A familiar thread presented itself. "Did you torture them? I don't care for your methods, but you are aware they'll say anything to make it stop."\nIf Livio was perturbed at all by moral constraints, his cold glare confirmed otherwise. "I did what I needed to do. Nothing more."\n"You lack finesse, Sillègue. You've done good work so far in earning your freedom, but you made some missteps at crucial moments. That can't happen anymore, we cannot afford any more stalemates against Iovinus. I expect you to do better in the coming months."\n\nAcknowledging a grunt as confirmation, the Duke would turn to leave, but not before inquiring one last time. "As for your personal investigation... I trust it won't interfere with your primary responsibility?" There was a small clatter as the wicked knife fell on the floor."
erie.6.a:0 ""It won't. Now leave.""

erie.7.t:0 "The Eternal Frontier"
erie.7.d:0 "Dealing with Livio's hostile attitude was always something that deserved a drink or two, but Vincent had to press on with his responsibilities. Learning from the château's châtelaine that his esteemed sibling was touring the riverside, he would set out to join him, taking no personal guard alongside him, to not attract any attention of course.\n\nIt was both a blessing from Boreas and a curse from Maar that the great river flowed so closely from his holdings, though the location itself had few good things to say about it. Dreary and wearisome, holes dotted the blasted countryside intermixed with snaking trenches and small scale bunkers. Even the sky itself was clouded in a melancholic grey, the only colours of life he could spot were fallen pennants and banners, still clinging to those who carried them. How many met their demise here? The living few seemed like shadows, collecting lifeless husks of griffons for burial and equipment retrieval, but Vincent paid them no heed as he climbed an imposing hill.\n\nAs expected, Cyrille occupied this strategic redoubt, his precious honour guard watching the perimeter. Clad in gleaming panoply and armed with various polearms, their purpose seemed only to look imposing and harken to a bygone time. Brushing past the watching statues, Vincent would join his brother, both peering across the gloomy waters.\n"Dear Cyrille, why would you return to this horrid frontline? I feel that a prolonged time here could choke a griff in sorrow."\n"Our duty compels us to never falter, Vincent. I hold little love for the battlefield—", his bloodstained tabard suggested otherwise, "—yet I know one day, we'll restore life to fair Verenia, the war but a distant memory of a frigid Winter. I have faith in the strength of Erian knights, and all who march with us to death and glory. Speaking of which, I am here to oversee the marshalling of our defences, and give proper respects to the fine griffons who gave their lives." He would then lean on his cruel looking halberd.\n"That is all fine and well, Cyrille, but I need you back at the château within the week. I trust you'll conclude your business in a timely manner?" Vincent wanted nothing more right now than the comfort of his fireplace.\n"Oh, of course. Do watch your head when you leave, my scouts spotted some forces milling at the other side. Wouldn't want harm to befall our good leader, yes?""
erie.7.a:0 ""Yes, yes. Farewell, till later.""

erie.8.t:0 "Good Old Days At The Academy"
erie.8.d:0 ""I'll say, my Duke, I am always too glad when you spare some time for our evening indulgences.", the Grand Inventor intoned in a jolly mood, in-between shuffling a stack of cards and refilling the shot glasses.\n"Think nothing of it, Fabrice, this is perhaps my only time to relax. Cyrille with his knightly nonsense in the morning, nobles and their prattle at noon, Livio with his passive aggressive attitude in the afternoon. If I weren't so invested in our struggles, I would have took my idols and moved to the Meridiennes a long time ago. Pass me the spirits, and do continue with that story of yours."\n\nVincent would usually say that rulers have no friends, only subjects and enemies, but Fabrice was anything but that. Professional when needed, amicable when in private, and all too reassuring despite the recent string of doom and gloom. Taking the fourth, or was it fifth, glass of Skyfall whiskey, he would contently rest his head on a claw and listen.\n\n"Naturally! There we were, right after stealing the dean's powdered wig, pondering on what to do with it. One of my colleagues said, 'Fabrice, you should just put it on your prototype clockwork!', and everygriff laughed at the idea! That curmudgeonly old bird deserved to be kicked a notch down... well, he did get kicked down, but so was I, for the first time. Maybe not my best idea." If he seemed to regret that, Fabrice didn't show it over his chuckling.\n\nThe idea of a machine wearing a wig gave Vincent quite the lark as well. "So, why don't you just invite your former friends? As in, here, to work with us? They seem like a clever bunch, though not as much as you."\n"Huh? Oh, yes! That would be a splendid idea! I am also reminded, I just finished today turning your investments into something useful. Care to hear? Our scientific breakthrough was quite astonishing."\nBut the Duke would only wave his claw at that. "Give me the paperwork when I leave, I'll read it tomorrow. Now, I am feeling particularly fortunate about this set of cards, so I will increase my bet...""
erie.8.a:0 "Surely, it will suffice."

erie.9.t:0 "A Knight's Resolve"
erie.9.d:0 "Château Erie's courtyard was an informal rally point for the household soldiers, yet Vincent did not know why his esteemed sibling gathered many on such a dismal day. To his credit, Cyrille and his paladin entourage looked like they haven't fought in a war only weeks ago, with their gleaming armour and heavy firearms slung over their backs. Yet the same couldn't be said about the griffs in attendance, many wearing casts and bandages, the poor rabble. Perhaps, he would simply listen and observe the commotion from a discreet vantage point.\n\n"I know what you're thinking, griffons—", the valorous captain began, in that same tone Vincent considered annoying, "—how could we have failed? Didn't you just recently hear, how the Erian warriors would be dining in Calembourg by the end of Summer?" A low groan was heard, as expected. "You did not fail, my friends. For there is nothing, no force, no weapon or alliance that can withstand the greatest virtue known to griffonkind - courage!" That seemed to have roused their spirits, if by a little. "All of you here, you fought bravely, in the proud legacy of your ancestors who defied Arantigans, Aquileians and others, and returned to tell the tale! I will personally assure all of you, the next battle will be ours, and the world will know that House Erie boasts the finest soldiers!"\n\nThe Duke wasn't quite impressed or even inspired by this rabble-rousing speech, but the same could not be said for the others. Many stood straighter and bolder, giving their salutes, a gleam of hope in their eyes. "Even now, more flock to join the cause of the Midnight Banner. Do you wish to be the ones to let down your comrades-in-arms?" A thunderous 'no!' was heard, as if they were one. Perhaps, thought Vincent, perhaps there is still a chance. One last opportunity to do it properly."
erie.9.a:0 "Where would we be without Cyrille?"

erie.10.t:0 "Listening To The Grapevine"
erie.10.d:0 "Paperwork was clearly Vincent's least favourite chore, but somegriff had to do it, and he had made a resolution to take a more claws-on approach with his underlings. Still, he wished that promise was made under the influence of wine, for his feathers seemed to get more ruffled with each letter read. Demands from city leaders for funding, invitations to the nobles' soirées, casualty reports from the front, when would it end? To make it even worse, his goblet had ran dry and that lazy servant hasn't showed up in the last hour.\n\nJust when the Duke was about to call it a night, a thin envelope with meticulous writing got his attention. This was the signature form of Livio, who abhorred giving reports in person, and preferred to do everything by letters and agents. Probably for the best, given how many griffs he managed to get upset in the previous month. Actually, was there anygriff who even liked him? That idea gave Vincent plenty of food for thought as he removed the wax seal and got reading.\n\n"My Duke,\nDespite the decreased resources given to me in the previous months, one of my agents has returned from her assignment with a promising prize. She told me that the information was obtained from a heavily guarded stronghold in Vinovia, and after personal analysis, I can confirm its value. It has been passed on to relevant griffs, and you may find further details on the back of this page.\n—Ducal Spymaster Livio Sillègue""
erie.10.a:0 "Excellent work."

erie.11.t:0 "Former Colleagues, Potential Allies?"
erie.11.d:0 ""Mon Duc? I've gotten into contact with my former academic partners and plenty would adore the opportunity to work for a stable paycheck, and to catch up on the old days of course. Will you provide for them as we discussed recently?"\n\nAh. Vincent had hoped that Fabrice would have forgotten that particular empty promise he had made under the influence. It was all too easy to be charming, except when you had to actually own up to your words. Unfortunately, as he was in the middle of a luncheon with House Erie's cream of the crop (Livio was not invited), the question could not be put aside, as many eyes were now on their Duke.\n\n"Monsieur le Duc d'Erie", chortled one of the attending nobles, from House De La Framboise, "I believe the allocation of our dwindling treasury was discussed at the court just yesterday. Would it truly be wise to lavish what we cannot right now?"\n\nMaar's claws take them! Vincent could no longer pretend to savour the flavour of Wingbardian white truffle tagliatelle (enhanced with butter and aged cheese, his personal chef was worth every idol), the decision had to be made before the guests got rowdy. Waving with his claw while taking a sip of his favourite tannic red, he would take a quick glance over the attendees, stopping for the briefest moment at Fabrice's earnest gaze.\n"Excusez-moi, dear allies. The meal is simply to die for, and we are all too blessed to be together on this wonderful day. As for your inquiries, I've decided that...""
erie.11.a:0 ""...Fabrice will invite over his friends.""
erie.11.b:0 ""...we'll go with yesterday's plan.""
erie.11.c:0 ""...House Erie will conserve funds.""

erie.12.t:0 "Supplementing Our Inadequacies"
erie.12.d:0 ""I don't see why would Aquileia lift a claw for us, Fabrice. They haven't done so before, and they certainly won't now, given their usual woes. It seems like an effort doomed to fail. Can't you just build the designs yourself?"\n\nCyrille, standing next to his sibling, nodded in agreement. "House Erie is short on supplies as is, we can't afford to chase this flight of fancy. Besides, my paladins don't need these gizmos, our valour and training is more than enough."\n\nIf the brilliant inventor seemed dissuaded, he did not show it with his enthusiastic gestures over various photographs and blueprints. "But, Messieurs, can't you see? I could not develop these materiel in time to be relevant, and we need every advantage. If we could obtain just a small amount of either tanks or planes, Iovinus wouldn't be able to fight back!"\n\n"While honour does not preclude tactics, we would be gaining these weapons on such a short notice. Our soldiers have no experience using them, and you would essentially throw them into the onslaught unprepared. I would suggest, mon Duc, to simply invest in our domestic mining industry. More resources, more work for the peasants, no risk of importing Aquileian revolutionism." Cyrille sneered in disdain at the thought.\n\nThe day when any of his underlings all agreed on something was the day Vincent would send Iovinus a birthday present. Why couldn't they work together instead of acting stubborn and bickering over minutiae? Oh well, the Duke enjoyed being the arbiter, it was a clear reinforcement of his authority. Having made the decision in his mind, Vincent addressed the room."
erie.12.a:0 ""I like the idea of these 'tanks'...""
erie.12.b:0 ""Planes! To crush Iovinus from above!""
erie.12.c:0 ""Aquileia won't help us, this is certain.""

erie.13.t:0 "Verenian Relief Plan"
erie.13.d:0 "The Duke did not consider himself a particularly reverent griff, but even he hoped that the Gods were watching with favour to what was about to transpire. Although, Vincent wouldn't need the favour of the divine if what his favoured Inventor created proved to be as decisive as he was inclined to believe. Only thing, though, was that he did not know at all that was going on inside those many workshops, only that the price has been rather painful for his purse.\n\nNo matter, because today, a hastily written note was handed to the Duke from a courier, urging him 'to visit Fabrice at the earliest opportunity, for a wonderful weapon that would secure the dominion of Verenia is completed'. That put a smile on his beak, and without delay, Vincent would take to the skies, forgoing decorum to see at once what he was promised.\n\nAteliers Avault was busy like on any other day, but the frantic crowd parted like the sea before their liege lord, who was in great haste to reach his brilliant subordinate. He would find him in the workshop's main hall, tinkering at a strange contraption.\n\n"Fabrice, my good friend. I've received your letter and got here as soon as I could. Forgive the old wings, they're not as good as they used to be."\n"Ah, mon Duc! I am too glad that you are here. Fear not, you didn't miss out on anything. I must profusely thank you for all the trust and investment you've placed in me, for I believe it has now paid off. What you are looking at is the weapon that shall crush Iovinus into dust and ashes."\nVincent was not quite sure what he was looking at, maybe he was still dizzy from the frantic flight? "But, what am I seeing? You'll have to forgive my old eyes, as well."\nFabrice would only laugh at he held out his claw towards the back of the room. "Our salvation, in the form of...""

erie.14.t:0 "Unethical Indulging"
erie.14.d:0 ""My Duke? Have you heard what has the Grand Inventor done recently?"\n\nVincent was startled by the sudden appearance of Livio as he traipsed through corridors of château Erie, clutching his chest with a claw as he regained his bearings. Fixating on the spymaster with a steely glare, he would respond: "Sillègue, what is the meaning of this? I told you not to scare me like that anymore. What is so important you couldn't send a note?"\n\nLivio paid little heed to the chastising as he pulled out a stack of papers for the Duke, and a fresh cigar for himself. "Thought I could stretch my wings. And let my master know what's going on in his holds." He stopped to blow out a whiff of smoke, ignoring the grimace growing on Vincent's face. "Read for yourself what has Fabrice tacitly approved of."\n\n"This is complete nonsense, Fabrice has given us great advancements recently—" His rebuke came to a halt as he read the reports. Peasants disappearing, unexplained property damage, strange lights... All near where Ateliers Avault had their branches. This does explain the recent string of dissatisfaction — and sudden technological breakthroughs. Vincent would have to bring his house in order. "I see. Thank you for letting me know."\n\nThere would be a shrug in response, and a warning. "We don't want another revolt, my Duke.""

However, I must inform you that the current model is unsustainable and running on multiple layers of loans and promises, already compounded by the embargo from the banks of Flowena. Unless we wish to start melting down our jewellery, victory must be achieved in about one year or less.\n\nAdditionally, your esteemed advisors wish to share with you their plans on furthering that goal, after they cease bickering with each other.\n—Vicomte Victorin De Perdrix""

erie.20.t:0 "The Nature Of A Paladin"
erie.20.d:0 ""Some of you have asked me recently, what is the distinction between a paladin and a knight? Do we not both use the same equipment and tactics? The simple answer is, no, there is no functional difference. We are the same, but with a different coat of paint, you might say.\n\nHowever, there are a few things that set us apart from our cousins in Herzland or Aquileia. First, the paladins maintain a tradition of service from the founding days of Verenia. Armour has gotten better and sturdier, certainly, and polearms and axes have been replaced with heavy calibre firearms, but our role remained the same: a vanguard of the few but brave, leading the charge from the front.\n\nSecondarily, the paladins maintain their strong allegiances to their liege lords and the Gods. A paladin without a master is certainly considered a disgrace, but that can be corrected. However, one cannot truly be a paladin without devoting themselves to the Gods, be it one in particular or all of them. Always remember that Boreas, Arcturius and Eyr are watching, and we must earn their favour through righteous battle.\n\nAs you may have noted as well, from the appearance of myself and my subordinates... a paladin has to maintain some sense of style, no? It does you no credit to run around looking like a haggard blackguard who scavenged armour from a corpse. For those of you who are interested, I have plenty of knowledge in improving appearances..."\n\n—From the lectures of Comte Absolon Cyrille d'Amphitre, Paladin-Commandant de la Maison Erie"

erie.21.d:0 "It was not every day House Erie would be providing hospitality to visiting guests, due to the long standing isolation brought by decades of warfare. Owing to desperation perhaps, these guests are the little known sellswords that go by the moniker "Grey Company of Free Knights". Called such because of the grey cloaks and dour disposition that appear to be their defining characteristic, plenty mock them behind their backs because of their rather dishevelled state. Conflicts have been a feature of Griffonia for quite some time now, yet as nation-states are reorganising their forces from feudal levies to professional soldiers, few have need for unreliable mercenaries.\nThe leader of these forces, Valens Silverclaw, has properly recognised that the Verenian strife might be their last opportunity to earn a respectable amount. He has graciously offered his services, with plenty of flattery, leaving the Ducal Court to decide on what to do with them.\n\n"Monsieur le Duc d'Erie", began paladin d'Étang, "I must firmly disagree with the notion that House Erie needs the assistance of these lowlifes. We are all aware of the chronic shortage of griffonpower, but how can we trust them to behave, to follow our lead? What little I've heard of this 'Grey Company' has been rather negative." His knightly comrades nodded in approval, believing this to be sufficient reasoning.\n\n"Have all of your brains turned to rot?" Spymaster Livio was never one to withhold a strong opinion, which earned him much jeers and shaking fists in his direction, particularly from Cyrille. "Silence your beaks and allow me to speak. My Duke, what d'Étang has said is mostly true. However, can we really afford to be picky about the help we can get? Shall we throw away everything we've done so far, just to satisfy a vague notion of 'honour'?" The jeering only intensified, as Livio has managed to more or less insult the entire room.\n\n"Enough.", the exasperated Duke stroked his claws against his face, "I have acknowledged your opinion and made my decision.

A whole perfectly good factory burned down, countless griffs killed, not to mention the other property damage! All that over a simple misunderstanding over the new conscription regulations. Fixing that had to be the first priority, as the Vicomte De Perdrix rose up.\n\n"Monsieur de Erie, the recent events were regrettable, but it was hardly a disaster. That district was underperforming for years, and honestly it was less expensive to tear it down than modernise it. The plan we came up with should solve the problem, as well as bolstering our assets for the future. But we will have to invest in better policing measures."\n\nThe Duke was happy with the proposal. The restoration of production, putting the peasants in their place, those were all excellent measures, but his scheming was interrupted by the "perfect" paladin in shining armour. "Mon Duc, I urge you to consider the following. I do not condone violence or insurrection, but we cannot push our servants too far. Show them some eleos, and we'll have a grateful populace that will support our goals."\n\nMust Cyrille always bother with this pious nonsense?

Vincent only paid half the attention to his sibling as he did to the thoughts of a new marble sculpture of himself, as the Vicomte De Perdrix raised dissent.\n\n"Monsieur de Erie, myself and my colleagues believe that we should invest further in our industrial capacity. More factories, more production, better for us all. It shall repay us in dividends once Verenia is ours, and I suppose the peasants will benefit from it, somehow. They should be happy we're paying them at all, bah."\n\nAnother difficult choice for Vincent, it seemed.

I do not deny that Verenia has fallen on hard times lately, but if there is something worth preserving, it's the traditions that make us unique. Are there any questions?"\n\nThe promising trainees exchanged looks until one Marceau raised his claw in response.

Clearly, this improvement showed he would be a better ruler than Iovinus — and today he would put that plan into motion.\n\nChâteau Erie was quite busy in the recent weeks, with so many new hirelings for the armed forces milling about. The Duke was relatively certain everygriff had their lodging, training and firearms secured, but it was Cyrille who should be responsible for such. Vincent knew his sibling slacked on paperwork, but that wasn't the reason he was making a visit to him. He would find Cyrille in the ornate-yet-uncreatively-named Paladin Hall, resplendent in all its white-and-gold aesthetics dedicated to the gods, and the order.\n\n"Cyrille! Are we ready to wage war yet? If I have to attend yet another dinner with marquis this or vicomte that, just to scrape some further resources, I'll choke on my drink." Vincent noted mentally to start ignoring invites after Verenia was his.\n"My dear sibling, you are just in time. I've just finished strategising with my subordinates, and we've determined two best approaches for the upcoming struggle. Every possibility was accounted for, and we will not be waylaid by any riots. Although, I must warn you, time is precious, and we cannot maintain our diligence for too long."

Riots were commonplace, but Gaston believed in the value of perseverance.

Thankfully, one didn't come for you this time. Look after the children while I'm gone, alright? I promise I'll keep safe."\n\n"Oh, Gaston, the gods are cruel! But less so than the Duke, for making the poor people go into another pointless war again! When will it end, darling? When will we be allowed to live our lives in peace?"

Those vigorously dedicated to the high ideals for which all holy griffons labour would be rewarded with the command of virtuous companies of sanctified warrior-priests, the legendary lynchpin of the great Paladin-Commandant's might!\n\nThe atmosphere was solemn and ceremonial outside the great temple, armours and helmets gleaming under the Winter sunlight as acolytes took oaths, giving the newly minted paladins the standards of their service: sashes emblazoned with their pledges and vows, and newly forged melee weapons of the paladin's choosing. Of course, nogriff was expected to use them in battle, for it was merely a time honoured tradition that endured. Just like the paladins themselves, who repeated one after another the words that bound them to service, for all to hear and witness.\n\n"I hereby swear to be a proud servant to the Gods, to uphold the honour of our order, to obey the orders of my master."\n\n"To Eyr, I pledge that I will show compassion to those less fortunate."\n\n"To Arcturius, I pledge that I will show mercy to those I best in combat."\n\n"To Boreas, I pledge that I will show loyalty to my sovereign.""

He had a family of four to feed, farmland to look after, and yet it seemed his obligations only grew and grew. Tax this, mandatory factory work that, was this truly any way to live? Does any griffon deserve this, he is never a chattel slave!\n\nThere was only one way to break out of this routine. He knew what happened to previous peasant revolts, but as he understood now, better to die on your terms than waste away on another's. It wouldn't take much to convince others, either. Freedom was guaranteed no matter what happened, and thus Gaston gathered the village's populace at their humble square.\n\n"Do you know why we're here, griffs?"

We'll simply paint it as an accident, and strike while chaos reigns in their ranks.

How unbecoming of nobility to not garb themselves!\n\nFortunately, the commonfolk had some sensibilities and showed some proper respect to his visage (the mean glares given by the paladin escort might have had something to do with that), as they welcomed Vincent to their humble festival. The Duke had to suppress many sneers at the overly enthusiastic village representative, who took them to see many "splendid" activities, such as storytelling, flower arranging, cider pressing, archery and more. Clearly, the peasants' griping must have been unfounded if they could scrounge up everything Vincent saw before him!\n\nSuddenly, the Duke was roped into acting as a judge for a pie-baking contest. Fabrice had a point, it seems, but he had one of the paladin guards taste each slice first (Cyrille, unfortunately, was too valuable to be used like that) before indulging himself. Vincent had to admit, the pastry quality was quite something! In the end, he had to choose between two — a tasty, if slightly dry veal pie baked by a lady griffon who looked like she could faint at the sight of Vincent, and a lemon pie that made the Duke's feathers feel tingly from the sourness.

However, he quickly got tired of such attention, forcing Cyrille to act in his stead, while Vincent made a quick getaway to a more peaceful activity.\n\nSaid activity involved watching labourers raise a barn, who were nonplussed to be spectated by a lavishly dressed griffon and his armed entourage. The quietness suited Vincent just fine, who remained content sitting and observing for an hour or so, until Cyrille returned to check on him.\n\n"Sibling of mine, have you had enough merriment for the day? Shall we leave now?"\n\n"I- yes, let us leave at once, Cyrille. I've grown bored of this unsophisticated festival." Vincent wasn't entirely honest, but who'd notice?

Much like clouds circling an eyrie, the lesser nobles revolve around their liege lord, vying for favour with both claw and charm. However, this relationship is built on mutual respect and friendly relationships: the taxes and griffs they provide are repaid in protection and guarantees of rights. Verenia was once a part of the Périphérie, and as such it maintains Aquileian titles and ranks (in the lands controlled by the Duke of Erie):\n\nDuc - the ruler of all historical lands of Verenia, after the kingdom was abolished\nComte - owner of a comté, consisting of a city and its direct surroundings, a direct subordinate to the duc\nMarquis - ruler of a border region that demanded particular protection, owner of a marquisat\nVicomte - assistants to the comte, an administrative position that isn't inheritable, rules over a vicomté\nBaron - possessing a baronnie, they are often subservient to higher lords\nChâtelain - commander of a château and its surrounding lands\nPaladin - an idiosyncrasy that developed solely in Verenia, represents members of the local knightly chapters who are not necessarily nobles (there seems to be a distinction between having a title or rank of one)\n\nThese are merely the most prominent ones, and those not bestowed with a title can hardly make sense of the elaborate system, making them prefer the simple address of 'sieur' or 'seigneur'.

Baroness Belle Delphine was the Duke's favourite when it came to schmoozing with the foreigners outside of Verenia. She had the tact Livio lacked, and inexplicably strong charms, but those didn't help against the cold cruel claws of bankers.\n\n"At the very least, our investment was not lost with the griff. Thank you, baronne Deplhine, we won't be bothering anymore with the Flowenans after this. Put your effort into places more likely to yield us an advantage from now on."\n\n"It is nothing, mon Duc, and I offer my apologies again." With that, she would shuffle out of Vincent's chambers, leaving him to ponder on his ever increasing debt.

Much to Vincent's surprise, the sprawling edifice has almost entirely avoided damage, as he walked down the lonely halls of what he called home so long ago. Nostalgia, elation, and a slightest tinge of sorrow - so many feelings went through the Duke's mind, finding the room he sought.\n\nWhere the throne sat, all of Verenia's history was on display. Colourful tapestries depicted its centuries long history, while busts of previous rulers silently watched as their newest ascendant passed. There was Kalem, who brought the tribe to these lands. There was Adelina, who lowered her banners to the Grovers. There was poor father, who passed away in such tragedy. The plinth that followed father was empty, the Duke noted with amusement. Vincent sat in the lofty ducal seat, his destiny fulfilled, pondering where to go from here. What does one do when his purpose was fulfilled...?\n\nThere was little time to waste. Summoning the servants to prepare for an impromptu coronation, a few hours would pass until the room's mood drastically changed. Surrounded by his peers and paladins, with a very furious and bound Iovinus forced to attend, Vincent kneeled as the city's prelate — Verena was her name, he recalled — performed the ceremony.\n\n"...and thus the Three recognise Vincent Erie to be the lawful duke of all Verenia...", but just as she was about to place the crown on his noble head, Vincent interrupted by taking the humble circlet to adorn it himself.\n\n"No, not the Duke of Verenia.

Said citizens had few good things to say about their new rulers, but they welcomed peace and more importantly, the free food given for attendance.\n\nYet everygriff had to stare in awe as lines upon lines of paladins marched down Calembourg, girded in their shining panoply. The bannergriffs carried the colours of their noble houses, the most common one being the Midnight Banner which represented House Erie, but there were plenty of others representing their minor vassals.

Pity Iovinus' wife and children were far out of his reach, but at this point they were meaningless.\n\nThe burly guard nodded as he allowed his Grand Duke entry into the cell where Iovinus was kept. The sight of his rival, clasped in irons, so thoroughly defeated and humiliated, provided an unspeakable amount of satisfaction for Vincent. It's a shame he couldn't keep him like this forever... or could he?\n"Have you come to gloat, brother?

I believe that by the right of my might, I may gloat as much as I wish. Everything you've worked for has turned to dust, and Verenia is mine. How does that feel?"\nIovinus would only straighten his posture, as much as he could in chains. "Even fools have to get lucky sometimes."\n\nIf an outsider could witness the scene, they would believe Iovinus was the party dictating terms. Oh well, if he wanted to be stubborn and spoil the fun, Vincent would cut right to the point. "Then let this fool tell you what happens next, brother. To secure my position as the rightful ruler of Verenia, you and your followers have to be disposed of, and I don't feel particularly merciful."\n\n"Get on with it, you gutless sack of horseapples.

Vincent insisted on it in a grand display of spite and irony, as it was used in Aquileia during the First Revolution.\n\nThe gathered crowd watched quietly as the condemned were forced to stand in a line at the elevated podium, as a cloaked and veiled executioner ensured the instrument of death was ready. Even though the Grand Duke was known to be unsporting, there was no herald making a mockery of the prisoners; the execution was mandated to be in strict silence. The people had little love for Iovinus, but they did not try to defy the order, for he was mostly a fair ruler who tried his best to keep them happy in spite of everything.\n\nThere were no words for what followed.

No resource was spared in this task, but now he was starting to feel like his purpose was completed.\n\nRuling from the grand palace of Verenia's past lords was his dream ever since he was spurned in 983, but Vincent's glee didn't last for very long. It was simply more of the same from before: holding the court, reading letters, upholding the law. While cutting open the last letter of the night, from his old château's châtelaine, Vincent bitterly pondered how wanting is better than having.\n\n"Ah."\n\nThe note was simple in its succinct contents. Iovinus has passed away in the dungeons, apparently from an hunger strike. Whether anygriff was to blame for this outcome was irrelevant: Vincent felt hollow inside.

Nonetheless, the Aranti river appears better than it has in decades, though the nearby land is not entirely considered to be habitable. Locals claim that the soil is cursed by Maar (an obvious superstition, it's merely contaminated), thus the most afflicted areas have been marked with saplings of black pine.

Ordnance is powerful, but it has a range limit, and so do the planes we've fortunately acquired from our Aquileian friends. These rockets, as I've come to call them, represent the next stage of warfare, as we leave behind the brave warrior risking his life in combat. Quite passé, if you ask me.

The paladins would simply cross over, hack away at any unfortunate enough to survive the attack, and victory would be his! Oh, glorious day! The Grand Inventor was worth every idol.

Not even a dent, as it shined brightly, reflecting the inventory's smug visage.\n\n"H-how? Fabrice, did you invent invincibility?" Griffon armour was known to be durable, but this was something else entirely. "Can we just walk to Calembourg, clad in this? Is this some pony magic?"\n\n"Ponies? Bah, how could they measure up to the ingenuity of griffonkind? I merely worked with our artificers and figured out an appropriate alloy, with a new enchantment that shrugs off everything... To a certain size. The enchantment wears off quickly, but I've secured enough material to make it last for the crucial moment.

We can attribute many reasons to past failures, but plenty of times did they fail to cover the assault. Now, no sense crying over spilled wine, but I've decided the best course of action is to correct this problem.

erie_cyrille.1.t:0 "A Tale Of Inspiration"
erie_cyrille.1.d_boreas:0 ""Ah, very good students. Allow me to recall... Yes, here's how we remember the tale of paladin Foisine."\n\n"We recall he was all the order stands for: honourable, brave, reverent to the Gods. For that he would earn much prestige, his sash heavy with honours. Of course, any paladin who served with such distinction would be worth their weight in gold, and Foisine wisely invested his into building a splendid château, and showing generosity to the needy."\n\n"Alas, all was not perfect for the noble paladin. He served a cruel master, one baron Proulx, who was not always this wicked, but his heart grew dark with years of vice. The peasants who served Proulx spoke of wanton acts of violence, and riots were frequent. Foisine saw what was happening, but he did not attempt to stop his master, in accordance with the vows one gives to Boreas. Always be loyal to your masters, students..."\n\n"However, one day Foisine would experience something that made him reconsider his stance. Whilst hunting in a forest for food, he saw lightning crack across the sky, with nary a cloud in sight! This was surely the wrath of Boreas, showing his displeasure of the villainous baron, and our paladin reconsidered if his actions were proper and righteous. What do you think happened next, students?"\n\nAs before, Marceau was the one to raise his claw."
erie_cyrille.1.d_arcturius:0 ""Hmmm... yes, this should do. The tale of paladin Blanchette, an unsung hero of a battle long past."\n\n"There was a time, before griffons built their high and mighty states, when war was waged with swords and shields. Yet there were always paladins, these brave knights that fought for their lords and upheld the values of the Gods. One of them was Blanchette, who was by most accounts not the most successful or devout of paladins, but she still served to the best of her abilities."\n\n"Much like the struggle we face today, Blanchette served a master who was locked in a feud with another one, and their battles were bloody. The outcome was never in either favour, and she wanted nothing more than to return to her husband and children. But the camaraderie she had with her paladin comrades gave her the resolve to do what is needed."\n\n"The next battle was a decisive one. Close ranks of griffs bearing pikes advanced on the outnumbered paladins, with Blanchette and her unit unable to break their formation. With their captain far away in the chaos of melee, they had no plan beyond base survival, but if they did nothing, the battle would have surely been lost. What do you think happened next, students?"\n\nAs before, Marceau was the one to raise his claw."
erie_cyrille.1.d_eyr:0 ""Very well, class. Let me see... ah, of course! The fable of good paladin Germain will suffice for this lesson."\n\n"Germain served as a paladin to an early Verenian duke, who tried to expand his holdings into what is today Pomovarra. This suited our paladin, who strived above else to attain martial excellence. He was a frequent tournament goer, and his battlefield prowess was spectacular. All this would to go to Germain's head, and he begun openly boasting that only the Gods could strike down his rising star."\n\n"Indeed, Germain's pride would soon be tested in the next campaign for Pomovarran lands. In an early battle, he got separated from his unit, chasing down fleeing levies who were of no threat or importance to him. Rather than sate his ego with the sight of an enemy fleeing from his might, the paladin needed the satisfaction of his foes facing them when they met the end of his halberd. In his arrogance, Germain would not notice he became surrounded by a group even he could not take on. What do you think happened next, students?"\n\nAs before, Marceau was the one to raise his claw."

Foisine would begin to subvert his master's actions as much as he could, at the expense of his purse. The love of gold is endemic to a griffon, but he overcame it in a pursuit of justice."\n\n"Baron Proulx would eventually meet his ignoble end when a distant relative of his returned to claim his properties. As it turns out, Proulx cheated his relative out of the inheritance, and when he called upon paladin Foisine to defend him from this 'pretender', he was nowhere to be found. Know this, class: be loyal to your masters, but do not impugn your honour in doing so."\n\n"In the end, Foisine would find employment under the new baron, his purse refilled and his service gleaming till the end of his days. What do you consider to be the moral of this story, students?" The captivated recruits, who were taking noted during the storytelling, began discussing with one another the merits of this tale."
erie_cyrille.2.d_arcturius:0 "Cyrille softly chuckled at the response. "Not quite, Marceau, but you were on the right track. Blanchette cried out: 'True and dear allies, I shall lose my life doing it, but I will make a breach, for this may you aliment my family forever!' and charged at the approaching pikegriffs. This was no suicidal action, however, for she broke pikes with her claws, and created a gap in their line by throwing her body at them."\n\n"Indeed, she took down many of them, but she was only mortal. However, when her unit saw the selfless act of courage, they rushed into the gap, breaking the dense formation and decisively carrying the day for their master. The feud would end soon, but the master and the paladins would honour paladin Blanchette, remembering her when they performed their sacred duties to Arcturius. What do you consider to be the moral of this story, students?" The captivated recruits, who were taking noted during the storytelling, began discussing with one another the merits of this tale."
erie_cyrille.2.d_eyr:0 "Cyrille softly chuckled at the response. "Not quite, Marceau, but you were on the right track. Our noble paladin, badly battered and bruised, laid on the field for hours until he regained consciousness, crawling back to his home in disgrace. Many have heard what happened, as gossip travels quickly by road and wind, and eventually Germain would retire as a paladin. Though his wounds and armour were mended, his pride was broken forever, as he purchased a small plot of land near lake Rumare to live as a simple farmer."\n\n"In time our paladin would gain a great fondness for the land. What was a rigid chore began to grew on him, and his crops were the largest and tastiest in the village. Soon, he began making relationships with the griffons who initially paid no heed to the stranger, and his standing in the community grew, as he became a respected leader that provided help in both labour and food. Not to mention, the wife he would marry would give him many chicks."\n\n"Though none of the griffs would learn of his prideful past, it would briefly resurge near the end of his life, as he claimed to have received a vision of Eyr, praising him for his life of agriculture. Most would shake their heads at the old loon, but it is without doubt that former paladin German exemplified the virtues of Eyr. What do you consider to be the moral of this story, students?"

It was a reverence towards the good old days, the flower of tradition which bloomed ever on, despite the evils of Kemerskainism that have spread far and wide. One after another, with an ornamental mace in their claws representing their oaths, each gathered head of noble families that served the Midnight Banner repeated and renewed their oaths. Vincent thought it was a great shame he'd never see Iovinus willingly kneeling like this.\n\nYet despite all these flashy promises, the nobles still had significant leeway in how much of their forces they would commit.

The only reason she took this job was for the sack of idols, and she owed Livio a favour. She missed their past days, with all the casual crime and violence.\n\nAfter the ponce and Livio finished discussing in hushed whispers, she was left together with the latter, who was quick to finish elaborating the details of her mission. If this Iovinus was also as arrogant as the griff who just left the room, then the world would be better off.\n\n"Livio, chéri, why do you work for that clown? You could slit his throat and be out of here before you know it." Eugénie reached for his claw, holding it tenderly.\n"He's as terrible as he looks, but the pay is good, and beats sitting in prison.

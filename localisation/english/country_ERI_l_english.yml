#### FOCUS

ERI_whats_next:0 "Ending The Stalemate"
ERI_whats_next_desc:0 "Ceasefire has been maintained for the past four years, despite several incidents. The good Duke believes that the time is right to make a change in the status quo, based on the recent information received. Our struggle simply cannot continue, something has to change."
ERI_war_of_course:0 "The Usual Method"
ERI_war_of_course_desc:0 "Might makes right! The only proper way to end the Verenian Struggle after all these years is by force of arms and valour of soldiers. The peasants will be mobilised for the cause, whether they like it or not! A decisive victory will ensure there is no more question about who is the rightful ruler."
ERI_peace_maybe:0 "Give Peace A Chance"
ERI_peace_maybe_desc:0 "Perhaps the choices we've made haven't been the smartest ones. If our soldiers and shells haven't been able to bypass the Aranti riverline defences for so long, alternative options should be considered. The charming Duke should be able to easily convince his rivals into an agreement that benefits him most."
ERI_enforce_levy:0 "Serve Your Duke"
ERI_enforce_levy_desc:0 "Slugs! Worms! The time has come again to throw our great might against that perpetual thorn in our side, Iovinus. As per their obligations, the peasants must be rallied to the cause, armed and equipped to the fullest. They shall support our knights in a glorious charge, and there better be no talk about rights again."
ERI_emergency_conversion:0 "Emergency Production Expansion"
ERI_emergency_conversion_desc:0 "Firearms! Ordnance! Shovels! The soldiers of House Erie always require more equipment for the war effort. Several non-vital production centres will have to be forcibly converted to fulfill these requests, and the Duke will tolerate no delays in the matter."
ERI_up_the_taxes:0 "Increase Noble Obligations"
ERI_up_the_taxes_desc:0 "The Duke isn't one for two-faced behaviour, which is why the nobles sworn to his banner should contribute further for his future great victory. Increased taxes, length of field service and required griffonpower drawn from their ranks are required if we are to claim Verenia in Vincent's name."
ERI_fund_fabrice:0 "Invest In Research"
ERI_fund_fabrice_desc:0 "Fabrice Assaultine, the Duke's Grand Inventor, is a griffon of brilliant thoughts, and he has provided us a great plenty in new technologies and reverse-engineered foreign designs. Surely, we should invest a portion of our yearly income to his private business, so that we may further benefit from his breakthroughs?"
ERI_fund_livio:0 "Expand Information Network"
ERI_fund_livio_desc:0 "Livio Sillègue, although despised by many for his deceptive methods, has been invaluable in unconvering numerous plots from House Eyrie. If it weren't for his eyes and ears, we wouldn't have been prepared for numerous feints and ambushes. If his activities received more coin, then we could count on clearer information in the future."
ERI_mobilise_economy:0 "Necessary Sacrifices"
ERI_mobilise_economy_desc:0 "Nogriff is pleased to do it, but the honest truth is that we must be more conservative with our already limited resources. As much as possible should be diverted towards supporting the war effort, with the knowledge of our complete control of Verenia being our guiding light and motivation for enduring this hardship. One day, it will all be worth it."
ERI_noble_oaths:0 "Rally The Bannergriffs"
ERI_noble_oaths_desc:0 "The Midnight Banner does not stand on its own: the Duke's most loyal followers come from the lesser noble houses, such as the Bonbolet, De La Framboise, Des Groseilles, Du Poivrier and others. Following feudal obligations, they must contribute their household knights in the next assault against House Eyrie, and the Duke will fulfill his side of the arrangement, as agreed."
ERI_approve_plan:0 "Knight-Commander's Course Of Action"
ERI_approve_plan_desc:0 "We haven't fought a war for decades without learning anything. The Duke's esteemed brother, Cyrille, Comte de Pont-aux-Griffes, has been working hard in hammering down a viable strategy that will allow us to break through the notoriously entrenched riverbank. There are no large scale fortifications owing to a lack of resources, yet the land is intensely difficult to advance through."
ERI_die_iovinus:0 "To End My Nemesis"
ERI_die_iovinus_desc:0 "The time is now! This is our moment of triumph! We shall march across the Aranti river and put an end to Iovinus' feeble schemes. Onwards to victory and glory, for the Duke! For Verenia!"
ERI_disarm:0 "Reducing Economic Mobilisation"
ERI_disarm_desc:0 "War creates much business, and it is great for innovation, but it certainly isn't good for the average griff who has to deal with a shortage of supplies and food. Restoring production to average consumer products should calm the masses, and show that their noble lords are most benevolent."
ERI_demobilise:0 "Sending The Soldiers Home"
ERI_demobilise_desc:0 "If we want to show that miser Iovinus that our intentions are genuine, then we must dismiss our forces from the payroll. Let the peasants return to their fields, and the foreign hirelings to return... to wherever they came from. If nothing else, the Duke's purse will get a lot heftier next month."
ERI_approach_for_negotiations:0 "Showing Sincerity"
ERI_approach_for_negotiations_desc:0 "The recent measures have certainly not gone unnoticed by House Eyrie, but the largest obstacle remains convincing them to attend the peace talks. It cannot be done through intermediaries - the two rival claimants must meet face to face if there is any hope of securing a lasting settlement."
ERI_plan_a:0 "Amicable Approach"
ERI_plan_a_desc:0 "Let bygones be bygones, yes? The Duke shall show his magnanimous side, forgive all past wrongs and slights, all for the benefit of peace. Surely, when faced with such abundant generosity, Iovinus will have no choice but to agree to everything we say? Vincent, you're so brilliant..."
ERI_plan_b:0 "Tepid Approach"
ERI_plan_b_desc:0 "There has been a lot of bad blood between Houses Erie and Eyrie. Nothing can change that, and nothing can bring back all the brave griffons who died for the cause. We've made the first move in extending a claw, but we expect Iovinus to show some good will and forgiveness of his own."
ERI_plan_c:0 "Aggressive Approach"
ERI_plan_c_desc:0 "Iovinus is but a weak, feeble minded simpleton. He's fallen right for my trap, and now we have him exactly where we wanted. A little blackmail here, and a little push there, and Verenia will be united with great amount of guile. I couldn't have thought of a better idea myself, and if Livio says it was his idea, he's lying!"
ERI_approach_avian:0 "Invite Katrina To Talks"
ERI_approach_avian_desc:0 "Who would have thought that the settlement process has gone far smoother than expected? A tentative agreement has been reached, but now we require the third party to join us. To complete the unification of Verenia, lady Katrina must attend our peace talks. Given her soft nature, she is very unlikely to reject the idea."
ERI_end_to_the_war:0 "To End The Struggle"
ERI_end_to_the_war_desc:0 "The most incredible outcome! Nogriff believed it, but Duke Vincent has managed to outmanoeuvre his competitors, with both House Eyrie and House Avian agreeing to accept his compromises. After all these years, Verenia shall be united, led by the most competent successor!"

ERI_we_fucked_up_again:0 "The Fifth Ceasefire"
ERI_we_fucked_up_again_desc:0 "Amidst the confusion, chaos and revolt - once more, we are forced to settle for the most ignoble outcome - a bitter return to "peace". What good is this peace when it won't bring back the griffons who died, or fix the damage caused by uprisings? There can be no half-measures past this point: the next assault is our death, or glory. The Duke will be taking a personal claw in the matter."

ERI_the_yale_connection:0 "Fabrice's Connections"
ERI_the_yale_connection_desc:0 "For all the vexations the Grand Inventor causes to Erie's nobility, it cannot be denied that his research produces actual results. Thus, it would be prudent to check if the latest funding from the Duke's purse resulted in some tangible benefit for House Erie, that would allow us to make amends for the most recent setback."
ERI_invite_old_colleagues:0 "Alumni Of Yale"
ERI_invite_old_colleagues_desc:0 "Brilliance often comes with a disparaging attitude for authority and norms, it would seem. Indeed, it's become somewhat of a trend to hear of promising graduates from the universities of Yale, who end up forced to work far beneath their capabilities for one reason or another. Fabrice has been wondering if some of these old colleagues could be invited here."
ERI_the_golden_mean:0 "Responsible Research"
ERI_the_golden_mean_desc:0 "The Duke holds great fondness for his Grand Inventor, but he realises that House Erie is on a tight budget. It would bring Verenia further glory to be the place of a new scientific revolution, but those are currently distant dreams. Fabrice will have to work with what can be spared."
ERI_no_limits_go_brrrrr:0 "Limits (And Ethics) Be Damned"
ERI_no_limits_go_brrrrr_desc:0 "Progress is a constant that is always sought after, yet never fully in reach. Why should we restrain ourselves in pursuit of victory? Anything and everything must be done to ensure we have an edge over our rivals. The Grand Inventor will have everything he desires, but there will be a strict deadline to ensure our investment comes to a satisfying conclusion."
ERI_tech_for_people:0 "Share The Progress"
ERI_tech_for_people_desc:0 "Who said we aren't generous overlords? Scientific discoveries are meant to be distributed far and wide, to inspire awe and fear! For now, we'll have to think a little smaller. Fabrice has taken a small break from his daydreaming, to write up a coherent program for teaching the masses. Of course, nothing dangerously thought provoking, just the basic things everygriff should know. Such as respecting your leaders."
ERI_licences:0 "Foreign Designs"
ERI_licences_desc:0 "Our goals would be far easier if the majority of arms dealers and banks across Griffonia didn't refuse to work with us. Boreas, it's not our fault we can't pay our debts on time, we're fighting a war! However, there is an alternative: bypassing private enterprises and working directly with a foreign government. There must be somegriff in the Aquileian heartland that will heed the plea of its distant relatives."
ERI_grand_experiment:0 "Spark Of Ingenuity"
ERI_grand_experiment_desc:0 "Numbers and stategies mean little when one side has a decisive technological advantage. Having worked for a long time on his most bold and audacious project thus far, the Grand Inventor has a proposal for the Duke that he'll find very difficult to refuse. Previous small scale demonstrations have been promising, now all that's needed is commitment and no small amount of resources."

ERI_indominable_spirit:0 "Hoist The Standard High"
ERI_indominable_spirit_desc:0 "The Midnight Banner has been bloodied, but not broken! We shall regroup, we shall come together, we shall never yield! Losses will be replaced, training shall resume in the earnest, the House of Erie shall fall only once when the last paladin perishes! Let us see to our preparations, lest our great Duke grows further displeased."
ERI_weed_out_the_weak:0 "Balancing The Needs"
ERI_weed_out_the_weak_desc:0 "Domestic economy is largely undefined and left to the whims of lesser nobles. As long as their estates and properties were managed sufficiently enough for the taxes, the Duke didn't really involve himself in the matter. However, this was always intended as a temporary measure until Verenia was united, and now we should make the first step in solving this problem."
ERI_bone_for_plebs:0 "Ease Up On The Peasants"
ERI_bone_for_plebs_desc:0 "The good people are tired of war and its endless provisions, which is all fair and fine, if we weren't pressed for every claw to our service. Recent instability, however, has shown that some wishes need to be fulfilled. For the time being, our gentler side will be shown to the masses, but we'll make up for the losses through other means."
ERI_fires_of_war:0 "Expand The Requirements"
ERI_fires_of_war_desc:0 "It. Is. Not. Enough. The good people may becry our choices, but no conflict was won through pleasant words and comfortable indulgences. Everygriff that can be pressed into some kind of service - they will be pressed, and hard! All unneeded frivolities shall be cut down upon, as well. The greatest force Verenia has ever seen will be brought through our sacrifice."
ERI_hedge_knights:0 "Wandering Soldiers"
ERI_hedge_knights_desc:0 "War isn't waged just for pride and prestige. Rather, some unscrupulous individuals fight for the thrill of battle, and the promise of payment. Such was the case when the old Empire broke, leaving many armed griffs without employment. Now, a band of these desperate stragglers make their way to the Court of Erie, seeking a patron willing to fill their pockets."
ERI_new_blood:0 "Fresh Recruits"
ERI_new_blood_desc:0 "They could not have been ready in time for the last assault, but the newest regiments have been trained to the standards set by our illustrious Knight-Commander. After a short ceremony for the newly minted paladins, they shall take their place among their comrades-in-arms. Hope they will be enough to overcome the difficult situation ahead of us."
ERI_relief_fund:0 "Carrot And Stick"
ERI_relief_fund_desc:0 "The virtues of nobility are exemplified by their treatment of the lesser and unfortunate classes. It is our humble obligation to provide for them, as they shall in return provide service and obedience. Should they act unruly, however, our generosity will have to be cut short. Let us hope they see the facts of life."
ERI_discipline:0 "Standards Of Paladins"
ERI_discipline_desc:0 "A paladin fights not only for their lord, but also their homeland, friends, families and more. Reminding our brave soldiers of their noble causes should inspire them to give their fullest effort in the coming battle. There can be no other choice."
ERI_ride_for_glory:0 "Bravery, Temerity, Dignity, Guide Us!"
ERI_ride_for_glory_desc:0 "A righteous cause is always worth fighting and dying for. A day may come when the bravery of griffon knights fails, but it is not this day. Embrace your closest, say goodbye to your children, for today, we march against immeasurable odds - and we shall be victorious! Advance against the world's ruin, for greatness has not yet perished, glory and courage! For our beautiful Verenia!"

ERI_cloak_and_dagger:0 "Livio's Machinations"
ERI_cloak_and_dagger_desc:0 "Nogriff really knows how far the spymaster's schemes go. Not even he is aware of every agent or criminal in his service, for he works through many proxies and intermediaries. Disorganised as it seems, it is ultimately to our benefit, as he is able to provide us with goods and information we couldn't seize through legitimate means."
ERI_expand_agency:0 "Increase Subterfuge Capabilities?"
ERI_expand_agency_desc:0 "The spymaster has been grumbling about his inadequate options concerning his role for quite some time. Livio is doing his work as best as he possibly can, but the few rooms given to him in the Château's east wing are reaching their limits. He has expressed a desire to have a more independent agency, suited for his needs."
ERI_infiltrate_the_hof:0 "Happy Little Accidents"
ERI_infiltrate_the_hof_desc:0 "A state consists of many parts, from its leader to the lowliest of clerks fetching paperwork. Far more than most realise, these "lowly" griffs are perhaps crucial to the wellbeing of a community, office or factory floor. If some of these were to disappear quietly, our infiltrators would have an easier time putting a wrench in their production plans."
ERI_sleepers_everywhere:0 "Revolutions Without Cause"
ERI_sleepers_everywhere_desc:0 "It is no secret that the peasantry has been griping about the conditions on both sides of the Aranti river. Why wouldn't they? Living conditions have steadily deteriorated over the years, trust in leadership has never been lower. Which is precisely what we can exploit to spread some unrest in Iovinus' holds."
ERI_among_the_people:0 "The Magnanimous Duke"
ERI_among_the_people_desc:0 "Sometimes, even great and wise leaders have to make appearances in public, to persuade their underlings that they ostensibly care about them. It is also an opportunity to lessen some wrongs, show a generous side, and much more! The question is, will the Duke deign to appear for the rabble, or will he rather stay at home?"
ERI_selective_destruction:0 "Misery Makes Great Company"
ERI_selective_destruction_desc:0 "Preparation is the most important part of any plan, and what better way to amplify our chances of success than to ruin theirs? Subverting House Eyrie at their every move will help out the ducal soldiers, especially when they notice that their foe has been waylaid, or greatly lacking in supplies."
ERI_the_job:0 "Most Dangerous Game"
ERI_the_job_desc:0 "For the past decades, war has been waged countless times, and uneasy peace followed each time, in a most vicious cycle of misery that's left both griffon and nature scarred. We have not fought to destroy Verenia, but to liberate it! The Ducal Spymaster has arranged through his contacts a most devious solution that will end the problem.\nPermanently."

ERI_duke_of_victory:0 "The Duke Of Victory"
ERI_duke_of_victory_desc:0 "By the Three above! At long last, the epic Struggle for Verenia has concluded, and it is our side that emerged triumphant! The banners of false claimants Eyrie and Avian have been cast to the ground, and we must make haste to ensure our hold on the region is secured. First order of priority: remind the subjects who's in charge now."

ERI_deal_with_katrina:0 "Amelinda's Heir"
ERI_deal_with_katrina_desc:0 "Unbeknownst to us all, Katrina and her supporters have been imprisoned since her foolish attempt to broker peace between the Houses failed. Her supposedly loyal commanders have seized control of her holdings, and tried to seize Verenia while we were celebrating our success! They have been dealt with, but the question of what to do with her remains."
ERI_appease_peasants:0 "Distribute Amenities"
ERI_appease_peasants_desc:0 "The Struggle was never popular with the lower classes, that much is obvious, but our forces are stretched thin trying to quell riots and silly ideas of "communism". It seems that Iovinus and Katrina were also not that good at keeping the masses content, so to that end we'll show how great we are by giving them what they want: bread and entertainment."
ERI_loser_faggot_iovinus:0 "Seal Iovinus' Fate"
ERI_loser_faggot_iovinus_desc:0 "This particular vengeance has been a long time in making; the dastardly adversary has been caught and lies imprisoned in the dungeons, awaiting his rightful punishment. Although some have desired a public trial, Vincent has rebuked any and all ideas of such: he will personally decide what happens to Iovinus Eyrie."

ERI_praise_the_advisor:0 "The Duke's Most Favoured"
ERI_praise_the_advisor_desc:0 "Many can be praised for their contribution in ending the Struggle, but there is one griff who perhaps deserves the most praise of all. The Grand Duke is most generous to those who have served above and beyond their calling, and they shall be most handsomely rewarded for their efforts."

ERI_rebuilding_calembourg:0 "Rebuilding Verenia"
ERI_rebuilding_calembourg_desc:0 "Weep for our beautiful country! So despoiled and ruined after years and years of fighting. We must get to work and start reconstructing Verenia one brick at a time. We shall start from Calembourg, make it worthy of its epithet again, and from there, it shall spread to all corners of this land. The petty people shall know the benevolence of our Grand Duke!"
ERI_disband_militias:0 "Send The Peasants Home"
ERI_disband_militias_desc:0 "The war is over, and thus we have no more need for hastily raised peasant militias. Let them tend to their fields and families, and grant the most distinguished fighters some sort of reward, too. More importantly, we need to work on restoring the many verdant fields of gold Verenia is known for, so that everygriff can have a full plate on their tables."
ERI_solving_illiteracy:0 "Teaching The Populace Something Useful"
ERI_solving_illiteracy_desc:0 "There is no shortage of cheap, uneducated labour in Verenia, but their usage has its limits. Thus, the good-for-nothing subjects have to be taught some actual skills, like mathematics, management, and others, so that we may extract further benefits from the fruits of their efforts. Of course, it must be firmly established that the social structure is here to stay."
ERI_putting_eggheads_to_work:0 "So They Will Work Better For Us"
ERI_putting_eggheads_to_work_desc:0 "Anygriff can build a house; four walls, a ceiling and a roof. Good enough for a filthy peasant, but not good enough for the Grand Duke! We require our best architects and construction workers to build factories, housing, administrative complexes, anything needed, of high quality to last the test of time. Let the people feel pride as they see these aesthetic buildings."
ERI_cleaning_the_river:0 "Cleaning The Aranti Riverbanks"
ERI_cleaning_the_river_desc:0 "The grand Aranti, which has served Verenia so well in the past by giving us control of important trade routes, is in a less than desirable state. With so many trenches, wreckages, and decaying corpses on both sides of the river, it resembles something from the mind of Maar, rather than natural beauty. It needs to be restored, the land providing its bounty once more."
ERI_expanding_mines:0 "Exploit Verenian Riches"
ERI_expanding_mines_desc:0 "Most of the country is known for its flowing plains full of arable land, but the rather sparse rough terrain is surprisingly abundant in mineral goods. Prospectors were only able to discover and exploit a limited amount due to the single-minded focus on war, but now we have the means and options to fully explore what lies beneath the ground."
ERI_science_stuff_1:0 "Establish A Statewide Curriculum"
ERI_science_stuff_1_desc:0 "There are many things worth knowing in this world, but what exactly is worth learning is a matter of debate. Useful information, certainly, but it is up to us to decide what constitutes such and how it shall be taught among the masses. Most importantly, the evils of Marksism and Kemerskainism will be strictly kept out of any books in this country..."
ERI_increase_development:0 "Catching Up"
ERI_increase_development_desc:0 "Attempts to keep up with latest industrial developments has largely been stymied by lack of resources and investment. Some, like the Grand Inventor, have successfully modernised their production methods on a small, local scale. Progress needs to be brought to Verenia, and quickly, lest our reputation of a backwater province grows even worse."
ERI_improve_infra:0 "All Roads Lead To Calembourg"
ERI_improve_infra_desc:0 "Much can be said about the road quality in Verenia, and very few of it would be good. Lack of maintenance has led to severe infrastructure degradation, leading to them being barely suitable for a farmer's cart. To accomodate the transport of goods and materials, not to mention the increased usage of vehicles like automobiles and trucks, the roads must be fixed and expanded."
ERI_fix_railroads:0 "Repair Bridges And Railroads"
ERI_fix_railroads_desc:0 "Railways have been used extensively in the Struggle to move griffs and equipment, but every connection across the Aranti river has been destroyed for obvious reasons. Alongside the general disrepair of these links, it has become a pressing concern to repair them for civilian purposes. What better way to symbolise the unification of Verenia than building bridges?"
ERI_science_stuff_2:0 "Reopen The Calembourg University"
ERI_science_stuff_2_desc:0 "Calembourg is no Yale, but its learning institutions were the best Verenia could offer. Many were regrettably closed during the past decades due to conscription and slashed budgets, but now we have the means and responsibility to offer everygriff a place for advanced learning. Not only will it prevent further exodus of bright minds, but it will allow us to propagate proper thinking."
ERI_modern_verenia:0 "The Land We Can All Be Proud Of"
ERI_modern_verenia_desc:0 "While Verenia will never be on par with industrial giants such as Griffenheim, Aquila or even Skyfall, there is something that can be said about what we've accomplished in such a short time. The lowly complaints have mostly been silenced, and life is slowly returning to the good old days before 978. Yes, things shall be good from now on, peaceful and unchanging..."

ERI_dukes_favourite_egghead:0 "Fabrice's Brilliance"
ERI_dukes_favourite_egghead_desc:0 ""See, mon Duc? My doubters have decisively been proven as incorrect complainers, whereas I was the strong voice of reason. Without my brilliant invention, we'd still be stuck on the wrong side of the river! If you'd allow me, I have plenty of ideas and plans on how to make Verenia grand again...""
ERI_more_experiments:0 "Increasing Experiment Scopes"
ERI_more_experiments_desc:0 ""It's a shame science is so costly, but there can't be progress without sacrifice, you know? If you would be so kind to sign a few laws into power, and grant these funds, we'd catch up to the established powers in no time! I can't guarantee success in every venture, though. Innovation is a fickle business.""
ERI_avault_expansions:0 "An Avault In Every City"
ERI_avault_expansions_desc:0 ""Ateliers Avault is not exactly a business in the traditional sense of the word... alright, it is, but I don't bother too much with the paperwork and bills. I have griffs who take care of the uninteresting parts while I focus on what's most important. Still, expanding my venture across the river would increase the options at our disposal... May I count on some subsidies and 'volunteers' for a smoother growth cycle?""
ERI_the_nuclear_proposal:0 "The Atom And Its Potential"
ERI_the_nuclear_proposal_desc:0 ""Mon Duc, there are things around us that we cannot see. No, I'm not talking about spies. There are forces of nature, of such destructive power that anything we currently wield seem like gnats in comparison. This is a very costly endeavour, but there is something you might be very interested in having...""
ERI_noble_reward:0 "Rewarding A Friend And Colleague"
ERI_noble_reward_desc:0 ""When I came to Verenia all these years ago, I didn't think I'd be staying for very long. By that point, I've crossed over half of Griffonia, but I didn't expect myself to find such charming company, and not to mention all this encouragement for my craft. I'm not sure how to properly express my gratitude - yes, even the bookworm doesn't have an answer to everything, hah!""

ERI_spoils_of_war:0 "Distribute Eyrian Holdings"
ERI_spoils_of_war_desc:0 "Despite the Sunlight Shield being broken, most nobles that served Iovinus have refused to serve the Grand Duke. Thus they've met their ignoble ends alongside their liege lord. The few who submitted will be allowed to keep their holdings, but the property of the dead will be granted to the noble houses who have loyally served the Midnight Banner."
ERI_a_trip_to_france:0 "Our Aquileian Kin"
ERI_a_trip_to_france_desc:0 "Verenia is not alone in the world, in spite of what some say. Whereas previously most powers ignored the Struggle, now they must contend with the united region. Making foreign contacts is a beginning, but more importantly, we should find a protector. We hold much cultural and historical ties with Aquileia, making them a good starting point."
ERI_feudalism_for_today:0 "Modern Day Feudalism"
ERI_feudalism_for_today_desc:0 "The lessers serve their betters, this is how it always was, and always will be. Regardless of what some lunatics squatting in distant north say, nobility and stratification of society is here to stay. However, the system needs to adapt to changing circumstances, but to what degree it shall change remains to be seen."
ERI_pay_denbts_to_flowena:0 "[Root.GetPayDenbtsToFlowenaFocusName]"
ERI_pay_denbts_to_flowena_default:0 "Pay Debts To Flowena"
ERI_pay_denbts_to_flowena_alternate:0 "Fiscal Responsibility And Solvency"
ERI_pay_denbts_to_flowena_desc:0 "[Root.GetPayDenbtsToFlowenaFocusDesc]"
ERI_pay_denbts_to_flowena_default_desc:0 "In our efforts to seize Verenia, we've run up a considerable debt to the banks of Flowena, which has resulted in them refusing to deal with us. Worse yet, they've informed every other major and minor bank on the continent, leaving us with so little ways to gain capital. With so many riches seized, we can now afford to repay the debt. With interest."
ERI_pay_denbts_to_flowena_alternate_desc:0 "There has been considerable debate after our glorious victory what to do with the debt we've run up with Flowena over the years.\nNot anymore! The vulture bankers have gone bust and so have their ledgers. With that in mind, we have cut down on unnecessary expenditures, and soon we can trade with the wider world with confidence."
ERI_peace_in_our_time:0 "Promising Peace"
ERI_peace_in_our_time_desc:0 "Although the most recent war has mostly left cities and villages undamaged, the lowly people are still very much tired of fighting. As we have no claims beyond Verenia, and wish only to rule these lands in perpetuity, the Grand Duke has no qualms by promising the peasants that there will be peace in our time. There will still be a need for a defence force, though."
ERI_benevolent_autocracy:0 "The Role Of Nobles"
ERI_benevolent_autocracy_desc:0 "The Grand Duke has treated his subjects well, and they have been rewarded with new titles, holdings and other privileges for their boundless loyalty. However, now that there is less of a need for a constant war economy, life turning to the slow and uneventful day to day management of a nation, perhaps the old contract could be renegotiated to some extent."

ERI_looking_for_friends_desc:0 "Aquileia consisted of many lesser states, and today they are plentiful and varied, in an uneasy existence. One of the very few things they share in common is a staunch determination to remain independent from Aquila's taxes, nor do they desire to take orders from a Griffenheim despot. There is an opportunity we can exploit here, to bolster our own position at their expense."

ERI_about_france_unfriendly_desc:0 "Perhaps the republican rot has seeped into the minds of Aquileian leaders, as our recent emissaries and dignitaries have been repeatedly insulted and rebuffed on every opportunity, and not to mention the unsubtle threats thrown our way!

What's important is that we focus our sights on the larger picture, where giving up some ground could result in progression of our design."
ERI_about_france_2_friendly_desc:0 "Although the Aquileians are ruled by griffons of proper breeding and stock, they are not versed in how the Verenian forces operate.

ERI_about_france_2_unfriendly_desc:0 "Over to the west, the Aquileians call this region Lointaineau, and they've made no secret that they wish to regain their wayward province.

ERI_ducal_bank_desc:0 "The issues we've had with Flowena and other banks has showcased that Verenia needs a certain degree of financial independence.

ERI_making_a_military_desc:0 "When Verenia was whole, it had its Guard. It was not the most successful or notable of forces, but it kept the people safe and our holdings protected. Currently, our regiments are disorganised, cobbled together from griffs of varying quality. If Verenia is to be defended, standardisation and reorganisation is sorely needed."
ERI_doctrinal_choice:0 "Force Specialisation"
ERI_doctrinal_choice_desc:0 "Technology changes warfare, and a griff would scarcely be able to compare a hundred years ago to today. One used to have to look somegriff in the eye to kill them; now it is slowly becoming more and more distant and impersonal. This cannot be mitigated, but rather we should determine forward the method our armed forces will conduct themselves in the field."

ERI_ducal_armouries_desc:0 "Much has been peacefully seized in the process of reunifying Verenia, but there are plenty of armouries and workshops that suffered looting and destruction during the last war.

ERI_paladin_improvements:0 "The Knight-Enchanters"
ERI_paladin_improvements_desc:0 "Enchanting is a proud griffon tradition, and it is certain that industrial advances have allowed us to apply them on a large scale, but something gets lost in this mass production.

ERI_better_rifles:0 "Continued Infantry Weapon Improvements"
ERI_better_rifles_desc:0 "Owing to what could be described as an foreign embargo, the firearm of choice during the Struggle has greatly varied from soldier to soldier. Whereas the workshops struggled to supply the troops with the latest rifle models, many had to do with an older design, or in some cases, pikes and muskets. With the industrial might of Verenia turned to a single purpose, everygriff will have the best weapon we can provide."
ERI_planning_redoubts:0 "To Plan A Redoubt"
ERI_planning_redoubts_desc:0 "There is a world beyond Verenia, and it may not look favourably upon it. The Aranti riverline is no longer the ultimate defensive point we could rally around, and an attack could come from any direction. While this land is sparse in rough terrain that provides ideal places for fortifications, we can still scrounge up a plan to bolster our defences... from one direction."
ERI_fancy_ordnance:0 "The Ducal Artillery Company"
ERI_fancy_ordnance_desc:0 "Current estimation predicts any future war in Verenia will be a defensive one, and our geography mostly consists of plains. Thus it is ideal to stockpile on ordnance and train griffs in their effective usage, to make any invader dearly pay if they want to take our land. Strategic areas will have to be firmly defended to allow the artillery its full effectiveness."
ERI_support_research:0 "Support In The Field"
ERI_support_research_desc:0 "One griff can achieve plenty, but two griffs can accomplish twice as much, this is certain. Warfare has changed and no longer relies on individual bravery, but closely knit forces that rely on each other to achieve success in the field. Our forces could use many more engineers, scouts, field medics, and others, but they require specialised training first."
ERI_forming_air_force:0 "Formation Of The Verenian Air Corps"
ERI_forming_air_force_desc:0 "Airplanes have seen very limited usage during the Struggle, as limited resources precluded their mass production, but their benefits and possibilities are more than apparent. Pilots, airfields, designs, all these and more are required if we could even dream of competing with more powerful rivals."
ERI_log_mot:0 "Logistics And Getting Things Around"
ERI_log_mot_desc:0 "While many nobles like the idea of having griffs drag objects around, it is not quite an efficient method of transportation.

ERI_new_training_program_desc:0 ""It's almost a shame the war has ended, yes? Why, I never felt more alive than on the battlefield! Nonetheless, much has been learned and the paladins will ensure all this knowledge will be drilled into new recruits. There may yet be another battle soon enough.""

In spite of the friendship between him and Vincent, the Grand Inventor has provided the means that decisively ended the Struggle once and for all. It is only a minor consolation for the nobles that Fabrice does not exploit his standing... too much.\n\nThe Grand Inventor's primary interest remains the expansion and improvement of all things scientific, but now he has also been placed in an unofficial position as the land's industrial developer.

E_E_rivalry_erie_desc:0 "§gSun-and-Moon,\nonce united and now divided,\nas Eyr weeps for her children.§!\n\nThe bitter feud between the rival houses of Eyrie and Erie - both houses as irreconcilable to each other as the Sun and Moon, day and night - has led to decades of incessant internecine violence between the two heavily militarised houses.

It is noted that without his brilliant tactical leadership, House Erie would have long perished, and it is thanks to Cyrille that the cities of Pont-aux-Griffes and Erie resisted three sieges over the course of ten years. The tale many recount at outings is one at the second siege of Pont-aux-Griffes, where the Comte held the bridge with a small group of paladins against a vastly superior Eyrian force.\n\nIn spite of his almost legendary exploits, Cyrille remains unclouded from delusions of grandeur. His sole commitment remains the furthering the cause of his liege lord, distancing himself from the politicking and schemes in the Ducal Court. When it comes to management and paperwork, Cyrille usually delegates the responsibility, preferring to concentrate on his training. Regardless of his immense propaganda value, the Comte continues to charge headlong into the next battle, leaving the troops under his command to wonder if he has a suppressed death wish, or simply vicious bloodthirsty tendencies.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!: KaiserSauce"

Such was the case with Livio Sillègue - coming from a family of vintners who made good trading in Vinovia. In a happy tale, they would have prospered and remained satisfied, if not for an ultimately unfortunate trip to the Périphérie in pursuit of a market expansion. Caught in the revolution's outbreak, they were targetted by insurgents mistaking them for nobles due to their opulent outlook. Livio was the only one who survived the massacre. Clawing his way out of the caravan with little more than his clothing and a few idols, he was not seen or heard for many years.\n\nIt is unknown what he did to survive, but Livio would eventually find himself locked in Château Erie's deepest dungeons, wanted for several charges of murder, arson, robbery and other heinous crimes. Execution was certain, if not for an offer from Vincent himself: put his underground connections to the cause of House Erie, or face oblivion. It was an open secret that Livio was hunting down the perpetrators of the worst day in his life, and to that end, he became quite skilled in collecting information (though he mostly used it for satisfying violent outbursts). Unwilling to forsake his revenge, he would take on the Duke's offer, much to the dismay of his fellow courtiers, forced to put up with a criminal only barely adhering to the proper decorum.\n\n"

This is not helped further by the fact that he has rebelled against the established order of succession, which states that House Eyrie has priority for the Verenian throne. But those close to Vincent would confirm his eloquence and learned mind, exceptional generosity to griffons who have served him well, and above all, an unshakeable desire to see Verenia flourish like in the times of old. Some even say that he can be very charming when it suits him, though Vincent has yet to secure marriage even after he passed 50 years of age.

#### EVENTS

erie.1.t:0 "An Introduction To A Sordid Tale"
erie.1.d:0 "My name is Vincent, the true duke of Verenia. For decades, I've waged a war of unmatched ferocity and fervour over these lands against my accursed half-brother, Iovinus, the false duke. In the past, our ancestors have ruled Verenia and its lush plains, lucrative river trade routes and splendid cities, whose grandeur only increased after we swore fealty to the rising Groverian Empire. However, everything changed after those filthy, uppity revolutionaries tore through the region, and left most of my family hanging on trees, including poor father. With the line of succession unclear, and my vacuous brother unwilling to submit, there was no choice but to fight for the title.\n\nAlas, victory was within my grasp, if it weren't for that trollop Amelinda, who absconded with a sizeable portion of my property and soldiers. The endless stalemate developed, and Verenia fell behind in terms of development and population. Indeed, I've even heard that in distant corners of Griffonia, they make jokes of two dunderhead dukes fighting over worthless rocks. To this I say, nay! They do not realise the beauty of this land, which I dearly love with all my heart. I'd love nothing more to see it restored to what it once was, even if in the end I'm forced to submit to some other rising tyrant.\n\nFortunately, my few and faithful retainers (the same cannot be said about the worthless peasants who keep complaining) work tirelessly in achieving the noble goal. Alongside the noble families who are sworn to the Erian Midnight Banner, the most notable griffons in this House are my biological younger brother Cyrille (who in spite of his stuffy attitude, is a very brave and capable commander), a brilliant mind named Fabrice (provides me with new inventions and drinking company on weekends) and Livio, the court rat (his schemes have not always produced the required information, but he is too valuable to dispose of).\nThese are my means, and I shall stop at nothing to achieve my rightful claim to the throne."
erie.1.a:0 "Let us finish this, once and for all."

erie.2.t:0 "Cyrille's Grand Plan"
erie.2.d:0 ""To conclude, gentlegriffs, our strategy concerns itself primarily with the capture of fortress Eyrie. Paladins will lead multiple assaults over the riverfront, with concentrated artillery strikes at their weakest defences, while I shall hold the elite knights in reserve, ready to strike once their soldiers move to support northward. With the capture of their main fortification, nothing shall stand in our way to force them in a most inglorious surrender." Peered over an extensive map of the Aranti river, Knight-Commander Cyrille of the Erian Household Guard and the Order of the Proud Ones of the Triarchy finished his proposal. "Are there any questions?"\n\nShuffling in their chairs, his subordinates, as well as his liege lord, Vincent of Erie, seemed satisfied with the proposal. Lacking other options, everygriff wanted nothing more that a swift conclusion to the decades of warfare - in their favour, of course. Yet doubting thoughts did not yield so easily, as one of the paladins spoke.\n\n"The ruse is too obvious, they won't weaken their defence lynchpin, even if we committed entirely. Iovinus gains nothing from moving off that hill, and might simply launch his own counterattack once we broke through the riverline. And what of Lady Katrina? Will she stand idly once again, or has she plotted something nefarious?"\n\nJust so, the illusion of confidence cracked. Nogriff wanted another folly from 3 years ago. Much has been invested since that time, in both research and information gathering, and who could say how much more could the status quo endure? Options were weighted, forces were adjusted, and in the end, an effective compromise was reached.\n\nAs always, it would just have to do. Honour and duty demanded it."
erie.2.a:0 "We hold faith in the valour of our soldiers, and the skill of our leaders."

erie.3.t:0 "Yet Another Setback"
erie.3.d:0 "This was going to be the day. This was it! The culmination of his efforts and desires! Vincent Erie would have his vengeance, and all of Verenia would finally be his. Confidently strutting in his workroom, the only thing left to do was await the arrival of an herald proclaiming victory.\n\nAnd not a moment too soon, there was already a knock on the door, followed by a frightened-looking messenger carrying multiple envelopes. "Ah, servant! Has the battle gone well? Is that cur Iovinus finally in a cage where he belongs? Give me the news now!" Alas, the retainer was too cowed by his superior leadership skills and could only meekly deliver his missives. Wasting little time, the Duke tore off seals from letters and began reading.\n\n"Peasant riots... front in disarray... full retreat ordered... truce declared?!"\n\nThe shocking turnabout was too much for the Duke to handle, furiously throwing the papers into the fireplace, followed by slamming his claws on his prized mahogany table. This could not stand. He has waged an epic campaign of warfare and leisure, and his idiotic, pathetic excuse of a brother refused to give in! There could be no more half-measures. Remembering that the peasant griffon was still sharing his quarters, he issued a quick and imposing bark, as befitting a griffon of his stature and authority:\n\n"Servant! Bring everygriff who matters to these chambers, now."\n"W-which ones, my liege?"\nOh how the Duke hated incompetence. "Every. Single. One. The Knight-Commander, the Spymaster, the Grand Inventor, the paladins in the field who aren't dead or dying, anygriff who does something in the court! Now get moving before I cut your wages!"\nSatisfied that his unquestionable supremacy sent the lowly servant to a dart, Vincent moved to his comfortable resting chair to formulate the next course of action. And of course, the scoldings he would give to his underlings."
erie.3.a:0 ""Can't anygriff do anything right?!""

erie.4.t:0 "The Faults In Our Actions"
erie.4.d:0 ""Well, everygriff? All of you have assured me that we were prepared, that this time for sure, House Eyrie would be trampled under our assault. Yet, we are undone because of what, a few peasant riots? I hope there's a very good explanation for this."\nJust like that, murmurs ceased, replaced with an uncomfortable silence, only interrupted by the ticking of an imported Macawian clock. It would have gone on for quite some time, if the bold knight didn't step in to the fray.\n\n"My liege, please, do not blame your brave soldiers. We all fought gloriously, spurred on by a righteous cause, but we were undermined by circumstances not within our control. Namely, the rat Livio provided us with faulty information! Pluck his feathers and flog him!"\nAmusing how the supposed icon of chivalry didn't see himself above passing the guilt, and with that, the cacophony was released.\n"My fault? It's not my fault your featherbrain can't read simple reports! Maybe you should slam your head on the wall less!"\n"House Bonbolet was always your favourite, my lord! Please forgive us!"\n"I say we teach the peasants a lesson! Torch their houses and fields!"\n"Does anygriff have spare bandages?! I beg you, Lothaire got shot in the wing!"\n"Fools! While you argue like ponies, Iovinus only gains! It won't be long before he burns down Château Erie!"\n\nSpoiled, insipid children. Vincent had to act before it came to blows and scrapes. With a mighty bellow that silenced the lesser underlings, he would cow them all into submission.\n"I do not care whose fault is it, because it is clear and obvious, all of you have failed in some manner. You will return to your posts, fix your egregious mistakes, and then we can do this properly. By Eyr, we've been stuck at this for over 30 years, you'd think we'd accomplish something right by this point. Now...""
erie.4.a:0 ""Out! All of you, begone!""

erie.5.t:0 "Workshop Of Wonders"
erie.5.d:0 "The sting of failure still lingered in Vincent's mind, but it was best not to dwell on it for too long. After all, he spent the previous two days indulging in the contents of his wine cellar, where a particular Francistrian vintage caught his attention. Now, the time is right to get back to work, and pay a visit to his most trusted servants. Taking a more personal claw in the matter will ensure nothing's left to chance next time.\n\nMilling through the streets of Erie, Vincent would make his way to the local branch of Ateliers Avault. No doubt, Fabrice was well on his way towards discovering an ingenious weapon that would smite Iovinus to scorching pieces! Or more likely, nursing a hangover from last night.\n\nWhat he didn't expect, as he entered into the workshop's main hall, was an arc of lightning striking not even an claw's length away from him! Vincent briefly felt his life instantly passing over his eyes, with a scattered prayer to Eyr, until his stupor was interrupted by the familiar smooth voice, slowly gaining in closeness.\n\n"Apologies, mon Duc! What you've just witnessed is my latest and greatest creation! It came onto me in a dream, no doubt granted by Boreas Himself! Still a work in progress, though..."\n"Aaaaaaah... Fabrice! What have I told you about safety measures? I could have been seriously hurt!"\nIf the brilliant inventor seemed phased, he didn't quite show it. "Nonsense, friend! I'm not much for medical science, but I'm sure I would have been able to treat any... non-serious wounds. That's the best I could promise. Now then, what is the purpose of my Duke's visit to this humble shrine of science? It's far too early for leisure, is it not?"\nOh yes, Vincent would have loved some casual games accompanied by imported Skyfall whiskey and cigars. But later on that, this time he meant business. "Not now, Fabrice, but I do have something most excellent to show you for that time. I'm here to discuss our immediate plans for House Erie and how your work should fit into it. May we speak in privately?"\nInstructing his workers to take care of the machinery, the loyal servant would guide his employer through the maze-like hallways. "I was certain we would triumph this time, but fortune did not favour us. I've been working on something to even the odds, but we need more of your generous investments...""
erie.5.a:0 ""Your clever mind has rarely failed to deliver, dear friend.""

erie.6.t:0 "Less Visited Corridors"
erie.6.d:0 "Vincent didn't quite understand what Fabrice explained to him over charts and diagrams, but it certainly seemed flashy! Though, he'd have to decide if he really wanted to fund this escapade, the last one did not end particularly well for anygriff involved... and that poor pony. Shaking his head to dispel a haunting memory, the Duke was quick to return to his estates.\n\nInteracting with that criminal Sillègue was never pleasant, but it was necessary, he was quick to remind himself. Vincent would find Livio sequestered in the château's east wing, far from any noble company (who despised the griff on principle). Ignoring the shady figures who passed so often beside him, the Spymaster's hideout contrasted sharply to the workshop he just left. Meticulously ordered and devoid of gaieties, the room was dominated by endless stacks of papers, several boards hanging from walls which contained pinned notes and photographs. The griffon behind all of this seemed to brood in his chair, sharpening his claws with a knife.\n\n"Ah... my Duke. Are you here about the recent failures? I assure you, I've done my work as you requested."\nVincent was not feeling eager to get in the range of that dagger, so he stayed put at the doorway. "Partially. Was it true what Cyrille said, that you've given them false information?"\n"That bird couldn't tell day or night apart once he's high on his knightly mania. We captured some fools across the river and interrogated them, as usual."\nAs usual, yes. A familiar thread presented itself. "Did you torture them? I don't care for your methods, but you are aware they'll say anything to make it stop."\nIf Livio was perturbed at all by moral constraints, his cold glare confirmed otherwise. "I did what I needed to do. Nothing more."\n"You lack finesse, Sillègue. You've done good work so far in earning your freedom, but you made some missteps at crucial moments. That can't happen anymore, we cannot afford any more stalemates against Iovinus. I expect you to do better in the coming months."\n\nAcknowledging a grunt as confirmation, the Duke would turn to leave, but not before inquiring one last time. "As for your personal investigation... I trust it won't interfere with your primary responsibility?" There was a small clatter as the wicked knife fell on the floor."
erie.6.a:0 ""It won't. Now leave.""

erie.7.t:0 "The Eternal Frontier"
erie.7.d:0 "Dealing with Livio's hostile attitude was always something that deserved a drink or two, but Vincent had to press on with his responsibilities. Learning from the château's châtelaine that his esteemed sibling was touring the riverside, he would set out to join him, taking no personal guard alongside him.\n\nIt was both a blessing from Boreas and a curse from Maar that the great river flowed so closely from his holdings, though the location itself had few good things to say about it. Dreary and wearisome, holes dotted the blasted countryside intermixed with snaking trenches and small scale bunkers. Even the sky itself was clouded in a melancholic grey, the only colours of life he could spot were fallen pennants and banners, still clinging to those who carried them. How many met their demise here? The living few seemed like shadows, collecting lifeless husks of griffons for burial and equipment retrieval, but Vincent paid them no heed as he climbed an imposing hill.\n\nAs expected, Cyrille occupied this strategic redoubt, his precious honour guard watching the perimeter. Clad in gleaming panoply and armed with various polearms, their purpose seemed only to look imposing and harken to a bygone time. Brushing past the watching statues, Vincent would join his brother, both peering across the gloomy waters.\n"Dear Cyrille, why would you return to this horrid frontline? I feel that a prolonged time here could choke a griff in sorrow."\n"Our duty compels us to never falter, Vincent. I hold little love for the battlefield—", his bloodstained tabard suggested otherwise, "—yet I know one day, we'll restore life to fair Verenia, the war but a distant memory of a frigid Winter. I have faith in the strength of Erian paladins, and all who march with us to death and glory. Speaking of which, I am here to oversee the marshalling of our defences, and give proper respects to the fine griffons who gave their lives." He would then lean on his cruel looking halberd.\n"That is all fine and well, Cyrille, but I need you back at the château within the week. I trust you'll conclude your business in a timely manner?" Vincent wanted nothing more right now than the comfort of his fireplace.\n"Oh, of course. Do watch your head when you leave, my scouts spotted some forces milling at the other side. Wouldn't want harm to befall our good leader, yes?""
erie.7.a:0 ""Yes, yes. Farewell, till later.""

erie.8.t:0 "Good Old Days At The Academy"
erie.8.d:0 ""I'll say, mon Duc, I am always too glad when you spare some time for our evening indulgences.", the Grand Inventor intoned in a jolly mood, in-between shuffling a stack of cards and refilling the shot glasses.\n"Think nothing of it, Fabrice, this is perhaps my only time to relax. Cyrille with his knightly nonsense in the morning, nobles and their prattle at noon, Livio with his passive aggressive attitude in the afternoon. If I weren't so invested in our struggles, I would have took my idols and moved to the Meridiennes a long time ago. Pass me the spirits, and do continue with that story of yours."\n\nVincent would usually say that rulers have no friends, only subjects and enemies, but Fabrice was anything but that. Professional when needed, amicable when in private, and all too reassuring despite the recent string of doom and gloom. Taking the fourth, or was it fifth, glass of Skyfall whiskey, he would contently rest his head on a claw and listen.\n\n"Naturally! There we were, right after stealing the rector's powdered wig, pondering on what to do with it. One of my colleagues said, 'Fabrice, you should just put it on your prototype clockwork!', and everygriff laughed at the idea! That curmudgeonly old bird deserved to be kicked a notch down... well, he did get kicked down, but so was I, for the first time. Maybe not my best idea." If he seemed to regret that, Fabrice didn't show it over his chuckling.\n\nThe idea of a machine wearing a wig gave Vincent quite the lark as well. "So, why don't you just invite your former friends? As in, here, to work with us? They seem like a clever bunch, though not as much as you."\n"Huh? Oh, yes! That would be a splendid idea! I am also reminded, I just finished today turning your investments into something useful. Care to hear? Our scientific breakthrough was quite astonishing."\nBut the Duke would only wave his claw at that. "Give me the paperwork when I leave, I'll read it tomorrow. Now, I am feeling particularly fortunate about this set of cards, so I will increase my bet...""
erie.8.a:0 "Surely, it will suffice."

erie.9.t:0 "A Knight's Resolve"
erie.9.d:0 "Château Erie's courtyard was an informal rally point for the household soldiers, yet Vincent did not know why his esteemed sibling gathered many on such a dismal day. To his credit, Cyrille and his paladin entourage looked like they haven't fought in a war only weeks ago, with their gleaming armour and heavy firearms slung over their backs. Yet the same couldn't be said about the griffs in attendance, many wearing casts and bandages, the poor rabble. Perhaps, he would simply listen and observe the commotion from a discreet vantage point.\n\n"I know what you're thinking, griffons—", the valorous captain began, in that same tone Vincent considered annoying, "—how could we have failed? Didn't you just recently hear, how the Erian warriors would be dining in Calembourg by the end of Summer?" A low groan was heard, as expected. "You did not fail, my friends. For there is nothing, no force, no weapon or alliance that can withstand the greatest virtue known to griffonkind - courage!" That seemed to have roused their spirits, if by a little. "All of you here, you fought bravely, in the proud legacy of your ancestors who defied Arantigans, Aquileians and others, and returned to tell the tale! I will personally assure all of you, the next battle will be ours, and the world will know that House Erie boasts the finest soldiers!"\n\nThe Duke wasn't quite impressed or even inspired by this rabble-rousing speech, but the same could not be said for the others. Many stood straighter and bolder, giving their salutes, a gleam of hope in their eyes. "Even now, more flock to join the cause of the Midnight Banner. Do you wish to be the ones to let down your comrades-in-arms?" A thunderous 'no!' was heard, as if they were one. Perhaps, thought Vincent, perhaps there is still a chance. One last opportunity to do it properly."
erie.9.a:0 "Where would we be without Cyrille?"

erie.10.t:0 "Listening To The Grapevine"
erie.10.d:0 "Paperwork was clearly Vincent's least favourite chore, but somegriff had to do it, and he had made a resolution to take a more claws-on approach with his underlings. Still, he wished that promise was made under the influence of wine, for his feathers seemed to get more ruffled with each letter read. Demands from city leaders for funding, invitations to the nobles' soirées, casualty reports from the front, when would it end? To make it even worse, his goblet had ran dry and that lazy servant hasn't showed up in the last hour.\n\nJust when the Duke was about to call it a night, a thin envelope with meticulous writing got his attention. This was the signature form of Livio, who abhorred giving reports in person, and preferred to do everything by letters and agents. Probably for the best, given how many griffs he managed to get upset in the previous month. Actually, was there anygriff who even liked him? That idea gave Vincent plenty of food for thought as he removed the wax seal and got reading.\n\n"My Duke,\nDespite the decreased resources given to me in the previous months, one of my agents has returned from her assignment with a promising prize. She told me that the information was obtained from a heavily guarded stronghold in a distant land, and after personal analysis, I can confirm its value. It has been passed on to relevant griffs, and you may find further details on the back of this page.\n—Ducal Spymaster Livio Sillègue""
erie.10.a:0 "Not bad, for a rat."

erie.11.t:0 "Former Colleagues, Potential Allies?"
erie.11.d:0 ""Mon Duc? I've gotten into contact with my former academic partners and plenty would adore the opportunity to work for a stable paycheck, and to catch up on the old days of course. Will you provide for them as we discussed recently?"\n\nAh. Vincent had hoped that Fabrice would have forgotten that particular empty promise he had made under the influence. It was all too easy to be charming, except when you had to actually own up to your words. Unfortunately, as he was in the middle of a luncheon with House Erie's cream of the crop (Livio was not invited), the question could not be put aside, as many eyes were now on their Duke.\n\n"Monsieur le Duc d'Erie", chortled one of the attending nobles, from House De La Framboise, "I believe the allocation of our dwindling treasury was discussed at the court just yesterday. Would it truly be wise to lavish what we cannot right now?"\n\nMaar's claws take them! Vincent could no longer pretend to savour the flavour of Wingbardian white truffle tagliatelle (enhanced with butter and aged cheese, his personal chef was worth every idol), the decision had to be made before the guests got rowdy. Waving with his claw while taking a sip of his favourite tannic red, he would take a quick glance over the attendees, stopping for the briefest moment at Fabrice's earnest gaze.\n"Excusez-moi, dear allies. The meal is simply to die for, and we are all too blessed to be together on this wonderful day. As for your inquiries, I've decided that...""
erie.11.a:0 ""...Fabrice will invite over his friends.""
erie.11.b:0 ""...we'll go with yesterday's plan.""
erie.11.c:0 ""...House Erie will conserve funds.""

erie.12.t:0 "Supplementing Our Inadequacies"
erie.12.d:0 ""I don't see why would Aquileia lift a claw for us, Fabrice. They haven't done so before, and they certainly won't now, given their usual woes. It seems like an effort doomed to fail. Can't you just build the designs yourself?"\n\nCyrille, standing next to his sibling, nodded in agreement. "House Erie is short on supplies as is, we can't afford to chase this flight of fancy. Besides, my paladins don't need these contraptions, our valour and training is more than enough."\n\nIf the brilliant inventor seemed dissuaded, he did not show it with his enthusiastic gestures over various photographs and blueprints. "But, Messieurs, can't you see? I could not develop these materiel in time to be relevant, and we need every advantage. If we could obtain just a small amount of either tanks or planes, Iovinus wouldn't be able to fight back!"\n\n"While honour does not preclude tactics, we would be gaining these weapons on such a short notice. Our soldiers have no experience using them, and you would essentially throw them into the onslaught unprepared. I would suggest, mon Duc, to simply invest in our domestic mining industry. More resources, more work for the peasants, no risk of importing Aquileian revolutionism." Cyrille sneered in disdain at the thought.\n\nThe day when any of his underlings all agreed on something was the day Vincent would send Iovinus a birthday present. Why couldn't they work together instead of acting stubborn and bickering over minutiae? Oh well, the Duke enjoyed being the arbiter, it was a clear reinforcement of his authority. Having made the decision in his mind, Vincent addressed the room."
erie.12.a:0 ""I like the idea of these 'tanks'...""

Only thing, though, was that he did not know at all that was going on inside those many workshops, only that the price has been rather painful for his purse.\n\nNo matter, because today, a hastily written note was handed to the Duke from a courier, urging him 'to visit Fabrice at the earliest opportunity, for a wonderful weapon that would secure the dominion of Verenia is completed'. That put a smile on his beak, and without delay, Vincent would take to the skies, forgoing decorum to see at once what he was promised.\n\nAteliers Avault was busy like on any other day, but the frantic crowd parted like the sea before their liege lord, who was in great haste to reach his brilliant subordinate. He would find him in the workshop's main hall, tinkering at a strange contraption.\n\n"Fabrice, my good friend. I've received your letter and got here as soon as I could.

This does explain the recent string of dissatisfaction — and sudden technological breakthroughs. Vincent would have to bring his house in order. "I see.

erie.20.d:0 ""Some of you have asked me recently, what is the distinction between a paladin and a knight? Do we not both use the same equipment and tactics? The simple answer is, no, there is no functional difference. We are the same, but with a different coat of paint, you might say.\n\nHowever, there are a few things that set us apart from our cousins in Herzland or Aquileia. First, the paladins maintain a tradition of service from the founding days of Verenia. Armour has gotten better and sturdier, certainly, and polearms and axes have been replaced with heavy calibre firearms, but our role remained the same: a vanguard of the few but brave, leading the charge from the front. There will always be knights, but we are the last to uphold the tradition of paladinhood.\n\nSecondarily, the paladins maintain their strong allegiances to their liege lords and the Gods. A paladin without a master is certainly considered a disgrace, but that can be corrected. However, one cannot truly be a paladin without devoting themselves to the Gods, be it one in particular or all of them. Always remember that Boreas, Arcturius and Eyr are watching, and we must earn their favour through righteous battle.\n\nAs you may have noted as well, from the appearance of myself and my subordinates... a paladin has to maintain some sense of style, no? It does you no credit to run around looking like a haggard blackguard who scavenged armour from a corpse.

Owing to desperation perhaps, these guests are the little known sellswords that go by the moniker "Grey Company of Free Knights". Called such because of the grey cloaks and dour disposition that appear to be their defining characteristic, plenty mock them behind their backs because of their rather dishevelled state. Conflicts have been a feature of Griffonia for quite some time now, yet as nation-states are reorganising their forces from feudal levies to professional soldiers, few have need for unreliable mercenaries.\nThe leader of these forces, Valens Silverclaw, has properly recognised that the Verenian strife might be their last opportunity to earn a respectable amount. He has graciously offered his services, with plenty of flattery, leaving the Ducal Court to decide on what to do with them.\n\n"Monsieur le Duc d'Erie", began paladin d'Étang, "I must firmly disagree with the notion that House Erie needs the assistance of these lowlifes. We are all aware of the chronic shortage of griffonpower, but how can we trust them to behave, to follow our lead? What little I've heard of this 'Grey Company' has been rather negative." His knightly comrades nodded in approval, believing this to be sufficient reasoning.\n\n"Have all of your brains turned to rot?" Spymaster Livio was never one to withhold a strong opinion, which earned him much jeers and shaking fists in his direction, particularly from Cyrille. "Silence your beaks and allow me to speak. My Duke, what d'Étang has said is mostly true. However, can we really afford to be picky about the help we can get?

A whole perfectly good factory burned down, countless griffs killed, not to mention the other property damage! All that over a simple misunderstanding over the new conscription regulations. Fixing that had to be the first priority, as the Vicomte De Perdrix rose up.\n\n"Monsieur de Erie, the recent events were regrettable, but it was hardly a disaster.

They should be happy we're paying them at all, bah."\n\nAnother difficult choice for Vincent, it seemed.

As the contest winner was dragged away to presumably receive their accolades, Vincent himself had a hard time answering each and every of his subjects' inquiries. Such was the price of benevolence! However, he quickly got tired of such attention, forcing Cyrille to act in his stead, while Vincent made a quick getaway to a more peaceful activity.\n\nSaid activity involved watching labourers raise a barn, who were nonplussed to be spectated by a lavishly dressed griffon and his armed entourage. The quietness suited Vincent just fine, who remained content sitting and observing for an hour or so, until Cyrille returned to check on him.\n\n"Sibling of mine, have you had enough merriment for the day? Shall we leave now?"\n\n"I- yes, let us leave at once, Cyrille. I've grown bored of this unsophisticated festival." Vincent wasn't entirely honest, but who'd notice?

Yet there was no other griff more senior than me, I reluctantly assumed the responsibility of leading the soldiers to quell the Calembourg uprising; those merchants had to be taught a lesson in respect. It seemed like it would be a simple matter.\n\nThe march from Erie was fraught with frequent raids by the republicans. They must have brought in plenty of foreign agitators, because no decent Verenian would act against their liege lords in such a manner! Fortunately, Cyrille (a humble paladin trainee at the time) helped to repulse these attacks and keep the troops steady. When we finally arrived, Iovinus was already waiting with his regiments, keeping the rabble contained in Calembourg.\n\nAlas, Iovinus was as difficult as he always is, refusing to budge during the strategic council talks. 'Oh Vincent, you do not see the bigger picture.' Fool! I knew we had to act quickly, or else the revolution would spill out further, and we'd all be hanging in the nooses by the end of the month. Eventually, I convinced everygriff on a compromise: indiscriminate artillery shelling.\n\nIt went on for seven days and nights, followed by an all out assault. The mercantile scum, the ones we could find, we were given their well deserved and well needed punishment, yet the most difficult days were only ahead of us after the liberation of Calembourg."\n\n—From the memoirs of Vincent Erie, Duc'd Erie"

erie.42.d:0 "Among the rich and landed, few things matter as much as ceremony. This is especially the case for the established nobility, who still hold reign over vast areas of Griffonia. However, the ideas of Marksism and Kemerskainism are taking hold, little by little, making those with a title to their name especially clingy to the supposed good old days.\nOne of the purest examples can be found at the court of the self-styled Duke of Erie. Much like clouds circling an eyrie, the lesser nobles revolve around their liege lord, vying for favour with both claw and charm. However, this relationship is built on mutual respect and friendly relationships: the taxes and griffs they provide are repaid in protection and guarantees of rights. Verenia was once a part of the Périphérie, and as such it maintains Aquileian titles and ranks (in the lands controlled by the Duke of Erie):\n\nDuc - the ruler of all historical lands of Verenia, after the kingdom was abolished\nComte - owner of a comté, consisting of a city and its direct surroundings, a direct subordinate to the duc\nMarquis - ruler of a border region that demanded particular protection, owner of a marquisat\nVicomte - assistants to the comte, an administrative position that isn't inheritable, rules over a vicomté\nBaron - possessing a baronnie, they are often subservient to higher lords\nChâtelain - commander of a château and its surrounding lands\nPaladin - an idiosyncrasy that developed solely in Verenia, represents members of the local knightly chapters who are not necessarily nobles (there seems to be a distinction between having a title or rank of one)\n\nThese are merely the most prominent ones, and those not bestowed with a title can hardly make sense of the elaborate system, making them prefer the simple address of 'sieur' or 'seigneur'. It is more preferable than running risk of offence by misnaming their betters.\n\n—From Notoriety, Nobility and Novelty: a Griffon's Guide to Griffonia"

I've instructed our fall griff to be as inconspicuous as possible, yet he was caught somehow. I believe he is now in one of their infamous prisons for debt evaders." Baroness Belle Delphine was the Duke's favourite when it came to schmoozing with the foreigners outside of Verenia. She had the tact Livio lacked, and inexplicably strong charms, but those didn't help against the cold cruel claws of bankers.\n\n"At the very least, our investment was not lost with the griff. Thank you, baronne Delphine, we won't be bothering anymore with the Flowenans after this. Put your effort into places more likely to yield us an advantage from now on."\n\n"It is nothing, mon Duc, and I offer my apologies again." With that, she would shuffle out of Vincent's chambers, leaving him to ponder on his ever increasing debt. It was something that would have to be taken care of after the Struggle was over in his favour... and if not, those greedy idol counters would probably append his owned sum to one of his relatives."

Regardless of our proofs of no involvement with that imbecile?" Iovinus wanted to be a fair and just ruler, but moments like these made his blood boil. Alright, to be fair, anything involving Vincent made him seethe.\n\n"To be fair, my Duke, they do not simply seek the payment of idols Vincent has falsely accumulated under our name. There are also sums that date from before 978, and the bankers are very fond of their interest rates. There is nothing we can do to convince them on the matter, at least until we remove the rebels from the situation." The Duke's treasurer straightened her sheets and papers detailing the agreements the House of Eyrie has formed with the various Flowenan banks.\n\nFate was never kind to him, Iovinus believed that to be true ever since the revolution. "Very well, Freya. If our options are scant, then the winning move is not to play until we have an advantageous position. Resume your responsibilities elsewhere, but note that we will eventually sort out our problems with Flowena." Damned crétin Vincent.

Much to Vincent's surprise, the sprawling edifice has almost entirely avoided damage, as he walked down the lonely halls of what he called home so long ago. Nostalgia, elation, and a slightest tinge of sorrow - so many feelings went through the Duke's mind, finding the room he sought.\n\nWhere the throne sat, all of Verenia's history was on display. Colourful tapestries depicted its centuries long history, while busts of previous rulers silently watched as their newest ascendant passed. There was Kalem, who brought the tribe to these lands. There was Adelina, who lowered her banners to the Grovers. There was poor father, who passed away in such tragedy. The plinth that followed father was empty, the Duke noted with amusement. Vincent sat in the lofty ducal seat, his destiny fulfilled, pondering where to go from here. What does one do when his purpose was fulfilled...?\n\nThere was little time to waste. Summoning the servants to prepare for an impromptu coronation, a few hours would pass until the room's mood drastically changed. Surrounded by his peers and paladins, with a very furious and bound Iovinus forced to attend, Vincent kneeled as the city's prelate — Verena was her name, he recalled — performed the ceremony.\n\n"...and thus the Three recognise Vincent Erie to be the lawful duke of all Verenia...", but just as she was about to place the crown on his noble head, Vincent interrupted by taking the humble circlet to adorn it himself.\n\n"No, not the Duke of Verenia.

Although it was still reeling from the most recent siege, repairs were quickly underway to restore the city to a semblance of grandeur, but more importantly, give the new Grand Duke a worthy capital from which he could direct the reconstruction of Verenia.\n\nThus the wide streets were cleared and decorated for the upcoming parade: the subjugated populace needed to be given an unsubtle display of the might that "liberated" them from the oppressive rule of House Eyrie. Said citizens had few good things to say about their new rulers, but they welcomed peace and more importantly, the free food given for attendance.\n\nYet everygriff had to stare in awe as lines upon lines of paladins marched down Calembourg, girded in their shining panoply. The bannergriffs carried the colours of their noble houses, the most common one being the Midnight Banner which represented House Erie, but there were plenty of others representing their minor vassals.

Who knows what would they have done with you if their plan succeeded." She looked away in embarrassment.\n\n"Ameli- mother always told me that the fighting was pointless.

"Even fools have to get lucky sometimes."\n\nIf an outsider could witness the scene, they would believe Iovinus was the party dictating terms. Oh well, if he wanted to be stubborn and spoil the fun, Vincent would cut right to the point. "Then let this fool tell you what happens next, brother. To secure my position as the rightful ruler of Verenia, you and your followers have to be disposed of, and I don't feel particularly merciful."\n\n"Get on with it, you gutless sack of horseapples.

Even though the Grand Duke was known to be unsporting, there was no herald making a mockery of the prisoners; the execution was mandated to be in strict silence.

Yes, she did a good job managing the ducal estates, but her constant prodding and annoyingly cheerful behaviour was becoming grating. Half-niece or not, who was she to push her beak into his business like this! "I could say the same for you, Katrina. Shall I ask some of the lesser families if they have sons to spare? I'm sure many would die for the opportunity to join our house through wedlock." Vincent coolly answered as they enjoyed a sunny day outside the grand palace, in the gardens.\n\n"And then what, some griff you don't like will become the new duke if you and Cyrille were to suddenly trip and break necks? Uncle, please. Verenia needs unquestioned succession. Those same families you mentioned have plenty of daughters, and you can afford to be choosy. Though, the nobles won't like if you pick one of the foreigners that came from Aquileia or Herzland."

There were griffs of all statures who could afford a decent meal, sure, but the commonality between most of them was that they were... taken. Couples looking at each other with youthful affection, husbands and wives exchanging knowing words. All that made the Grand Duke feel awfully lonely, and while he never lacked company in the past, he knew he needed to settle down eventually.\n\nAnd get those vultures off his back, as well. If he had yet another noble pester him at the court to marry his daughter, perhaps he would have to switch teams.

Some of the blame for the succession crisis could be placed on his shoulders. But it would be inappropriate to speak ill of the dead. Thus, the Grand Duke measured his worth...\n\n...and found himself more than satisfactory. It was he who had emerged victorious in the Struggle.

Livio punctuated his feigned hurt feelings by blowing smoke from the ever present and ever annoying cigar.\n\n"Yes, yes, of course I'll keep my word, but I still have need of you! Did we not also agreed that I would provide the resources for your search?" There was only a dismissive wave of the claw in return.\n\n"I appreciate that—", his tone was not grateful at all, "—but I think I can solve my problems on my own. Thus, I'll be departing tomorrow, but do not find me ungrateful for... giving me a chance to prove myself. To that end, I brought Comte des Ba—"\n\n"Comte who? The only comte in Verenia is Cyrille—", Vincent was quickly hushed by Livio, as the revealed stranger shot a fierce glare. "Indulge him, my Duke. I taught him all there is to know about intelligence gathering, and Comte des Battes shall be a worthy replacement for my role. Now, I have a few things left to wrap up before I leave, so you'll have to forgive me if I don't have time for you, my Duke."

Attended by his noble retinue, [Root.GetLeader] was escorted by a handsome young griffon who served as the gallery's curator. As they passed between room to room, each with its theme, intriguing commentary was spoken and exchanged. The Duke had several colourful commentaries of his own regarding the artwork, such as the series of paintings depicting the life of Grover the Second ("Grover the Overrated, more like"), exact replicas of sculptures from the famed Canterlot Garden ("Why did we care about ponies again?") or some strange shapes that were puzzling in their representation ("Some called it avant-garde, it must be a fad").\n\nThe strangest thing seen, however, was a sculpture depicting what seemed to be a griffon. Unlike real ones, this one stood on its hind legs, like a minotaur, clutching an odd glaive with a rounded tip.

erie.98.d:0 "Griffs today would have you believe that feudalism is one of the staples of our society, tracing back to the semi-legendary descent from the Hyperborean mountains. Even across the sea, the Sun Princess has her own noble ponies, although their power has all but eroded today. This is, of course, a contemporary misconception.\n\nShould one look up the term in a book today, it would say that feudalism is "a social system based on the relationship between the landholder and those who provide services and labour in order to live there". This conflates two distinct concepts that have often co-existed (but not always) called manorialism and vassalage. The former describes the economic system which structured the relations between free griffons (later on serfs) and their elite landlords, whereas the latter is a political system which structured relations between ruling classes.\n\nFor example, while the manorial system was already established in the time of Arantigos the Conqueror, in a legal sense Arantigos did not have a series of fealties and homages given to him by his subjects. Rather, it was an informal arrangement backed by force, with a caste of professional bureaucrats overseeing their obligations. The concepts of vassalage and suzerainty would not appear until the Discrets' consolidation of power, but in its most pure state, it was introduced by the Groverian dynasty as they organised their vast empire into a civilised polity.\n\nIn conclusion, while manorialism and vassalage appear to be inexorably connected, they are separated systems explaining relations between two different classes of griffons. It begs the question if feudalism is even the right word to describe the society of the past, and even today."

Cyrille would drop his helmet and stomp out of the room as well, his tail flicking angrily.\n"I'm no virtuous soul, we both know what I've done, but I was NEVER a cheat. Maar curse you." Livio would leave too, finishing this sudden bout of humiliation for Vincent.\n\nBefore he could recover and figure out what happened, a rock shattered the window and almost struck the poor Duke in the head. Looking through the broken glass, Vincent saw an angry mob, armed with painful implements. He even recognised some in the crowd as his noble vassals! Oh, this was going to be very, very bad."

erie_fabrice.1.d_destruction:0 ""...is that an ordnance shell? It looks considerably larger, though." Vincent clawed at his beak in confusion. Didn't seem like it could fit into any barrel, either. What exactly was Fabrice's ploy?\n\n"No, not at all, my Duke! What you are looking at is an experiment in brilliance. Ordnance is powerful, but it has a range limit, and so do the planes we've fortunately acquired from our Aquileian friends. These rockets, as I've come to call them, represent the next stage of warfare, as we leave behind the brave warrior risking his life in combat. Quite passé, if you ask me. But I digress - this weapon will allow us to safely strike at the other side of the river with no danger for any of our soldiers. I've found the most difficult challenge to be ensuring that the guidance system is precise..."\n\nFabrice was brilliant, but perhaps a bit too much, because Vincent stopped paying attention to his rambling. Rather, he focused on what he understood - devastating assault making short work of the notoriously entrenched riverbank. The paladins would simply cross over, hack away at any unfortunate enough to survive the attack, and victory would be his! Oh, glorious day! The Grand Inventor was worth every idol. Speaking of which, he raised his claw to interrupt:\n\n"How much did it cost, Fabrice?"\n\n"It was within budget, though I had to scrap some of the planes for parts. I predict we'll have about twenty of these prepared."\nGood, Vincent couldn't afford bankruptcy, he still owed much to Flowenan banks. "Most excellent.""
erie_fabrice.1.d_protection:0 ""That's just a paladin's suit of armour. Cyrille has at least four in his chambers, for aesthetics." Vincent clawed at his beak in confusion. The protection was quite shiny, but didn't appear to be special in any form.\n\n"Ah, but there's a catch, my Duke! Observe." He watched as Fabrice strolled in front of the chest piece, pulling out a revolver and firing point blank. The clang reverberated in the Duke's ears, wincing from the sudden noise.\n\n"I don't see the point of—" But before Vincent could regain his bearings, Fabrice subjected the panoply to increasingly tougher punishments, using stronger firearms, blunt objects and even throwing a vial of green liquid at it. The Duke had two questions in his mind: where did he learn to use guns, and how is that thing still untarnished? Not even a dent, as it shined brightly, reflecting the inventory's smug visage.\n\n"H-how? Fabrice, did you invent invincibility?" Griffon armour was known to be durable, but this was something else entirely. "Can we just walk to Calembourg, clad in this? Is this some pony magic?"\n\n"Ponies? Bah, how could they measure up to the ingenuity of griffonkind? I merely worked with our artificers and figured out an appropriate alloy, with a new enchantment that shrugs off everything... To a certain size. The enchantment wears off quickly, but I've secured enough material to make it last for the crucial moment. Our paladins will stare at Maar in the eye, and will not falter."\nVincent hoped invincibility was cheap, he still had to repay those vultures in Flowena. "Most excellent.""
erie_fabrice.1.d_machinery:0 ""Quite the length on that barrel, Fabrice, but don't we have enough artillery already?" Vincent still stroked at his cheek in amazement, thinking about the size of the ammunition that thing would use. Not to mention the recoil.\n\n"Quite honestly, my Duke, the artillery crews do a sloppy job even on the best of days. We can attribute many reasons to past failures, but plenty of times did they fail to cover the assault. Now, no sense crying over spilled wine, but I've decided the best course of action is to correct this problem. Later on, after we seize victory, we can train the griffs properly."\n\n"But where will this cannon be mounted upon? I don't think any chassis we have could support it."\n\n"I thought about using some of those tanks we acquired from our Aquileian friends, but those frames were simply too fragile to carry it. No, it will be placed upon a modified train, upon which it will easily follow the troops as they progress forward. I have already gathered the best griffs for the task of firing, reloading and maintaining, while while myself will personally ensure its accuracy. Two, three shots, and fortress Eyrie will be a ruin." The proud inventor gleamed as he polished the barrel's exterior.\nVincent hoped the shells for the railway gun were cheap, Flowena would collect on his debt eventually. "Most excellent."""

For that he would earn much prestige, his sash heavy with honours. Of course, any paladin who served with such distinction would be worth their weight in gold, and Foisine wisely invested his into building a splendid château, and showing generosity to the needy."\n\n"Alas, all was not perfect for the noble paladin. He served a cruel master, one baron Proulx, who was not always this wicked, but his heart grew dark with years of vice. The peasants who served Proulx spoke of wanton acts of violence, and riots were frequent. Foisine saw what was happening, but he did not attempt to stop his master, in accordance with the vows one gives to Boreas. Always be loyal to your masters, students..."\n\n"However, one day Foisine would experience something that made him reconsider his stance. Whilst hunting in a forest for food, he saw lightning crack across the sky, with nary a cloud in sight! This was surely the wrath of Boreas, showing his displeasure of the villainous baron, and our paladin reconsidered if his actions were proper and righteous.

The tale of paladin Blanchette, an unsung hero of a battle long past."\n\n"There was a time, before griffons built their high and mighty states, when war was waged with swords and shields. Yet there were always paladins, these brave knights that fought for their lords and upheld the values of the Gods. One of them was Blanchette, who was by most accounts not the most successful or devout of paladins, but she still served to the best of her abilities."\n\n"Much like the struggle we face today, Blanchette served a master who was locked in a feud with another one, and their battles were bloody. The outcome was never in either favour, and she wanted nothing more than to return to her husband and children. But the camaraderie she had with her paladin comrades gave her the resolve to do what is needed."\n\n"The next battle was a decisive one. Close ranks of griffs bearing pikes advanced on the outnumbered paladins, with Blanchette and her unit unable to break their formation. With their captain far away in the chaos of melee, they had no plan beyond base survival, but if they did nothing, the battle would have surely been lost. What do you think happened next, students?"\n\nAs before, Marceau was the one to raise his claw."

This suited our paladin, who strived above else to attain martial excellence. He was a frequent tournament goer, and his battlefield prowess was spectacular. All this would to go to Germain's head, and he begun openly boasting that only the Gods could strike down his rising star."\n\n"Indeed, Germain's pride would soon be tested in the next campaign for Pomovarran lands. In an early battle, he got separated from his unit, chasing down fleeing levies who were of no threat or importance to him. Rather than sate his ego with the sight of an enemy fleeing from his might, the paladin needed the satisfaction of his foes facing them when they met the end of his halberd.

What was a rigid chore began to grew on him, and his crops were the largest and tastiest in the village. Soon, he began making relationships with the griffons who initially paid no heed to the stranger, and his standing in the community grew, as he became a respected leader that provided help in both labour and food. Not to mention, the wife he would marry would give him many chicks."\n\n"Though none of the griffs would learn of his prideful past, it would briefly resurge near the end of his life, as he claimed to have received a vision of Eyr, praising him for his life of agriculture.

Vincent thought it was a great shame he'd never see Iovinus willingly kneeling like this.\n\nYet despite all these flashy promises, the nobles still had significant leeway in how much of their forces they would commit. Vincent would have to negotiate with each and every griff to secure proper assistance."

Fabrice did everything he could to increase the production of weaponry, while Livio propagated the latest information on Eyrian positions and strength. And as usual, the ever eager Cyrille was happy to take his place at the frontline. This time, he actually stopped him to present his worries, but Cyrille brushed them off as usual. "The Gods are on our side, Vincent", he said. Will Boreas bring back the only family member he had care for? Obviously he didn't give a feather about Iovinus and his spawn, and he never met Katrina to begin with.\n\nAbsently trying to assuage his anxiety by looking over some nondescript maps and paperwork, the Duke knew that this his last opportunity to claim Verenia for himself. Everything that wasn't strictly mandatory was sold off to fund the effort, and the damned rabble would be raising Tartarus again over the war. If only they understood that he would make everything better, that he would give them plenty of reasons to respect their betters.\n\nNothing more needed to be done. The House of Erie has been humbled plentifully, but it will be us now rising in triumph. For victory, for Verenia."

erie_cyrille.8.d:0 "Paladin Keu was an honest and good servant to the Gods, but right now she had to seriously consider if she was following the right path. Clutching her sash as her company was ferried in rickety barges across Lake Rumare, she wondered how exactly did paladin Cyrille convince her to lead this display of "tactical ingenuity".\n\nOn paper, the plan seemed simple: bypass the riverline defences by going around them through the lake. Since the largest vessel one could find here was a fishing boat, there was no danger of being intercepted and sunk. Once they reached the shore, they would clash with the defenders while the rest of the paladins started their assault. Truly a ploy worthy of Cyrille!\n\nIn reality, she was dreading every upcoming moment. Yes, they trained this company in amphibious tactics, yes, they began this attack under the cover of night, but she feared something would happen, that would entirely ruin the surprise. And then she would have to die because honour demanded it. If only she got assigned to a more bureaucratic function instead of this.\n\n"Madame Keu? Captain? We've almost reached the shore." Her adjutant helpfully quipped. As if that was any comfort. Time to wear her bravest face she could muster.\n\n"Griffons! We are about to land! Ready your weapons and pray to the Gods for victory!" And pray for her, too."

erie_cyrille.9.d:0 "To nogriff's surprise, there was an invading force trying to cross the Aranti river.\n\nWhereas to most this would cause an extreme alarm, maybe even a panic attack, Iovinus was only slightly perturbed. It was nothing new for Vincent to try and claim what was rightfully his. Additionally, this would also silence the warmongering nobles who wanted nothing less than to throw themselves (their thralls, in actuality) at the Erian defences. Iovinus expected nothing more than a repeat of the last year.\n\nThat is, until the reports started arriving to his desk.\n\nThis assault from his petulant sibling was of unmatched severity. It seemed that no expenses were spared in assembling a mighty host — foreign units and levies were both seen in great numbers — but the most concerning issue regarded a sudden landing of units behind the riverine defences. Somehow, sentries managed to miss an entire force making a landing! Why did he keep paying infiltrators if they couldn't uncover a painfully transparent plan?!\n\nIovinus felt afraid. Will his preparations amount to anything? He needed to involve himself directly. This was a battle for the future of beautiful Verenia."

Took a high calibre round to the neck, apparently."\n\n"The Gods look with pride, but it is us who must ensure the sacrifice is not forgotten, and most certainly not in vain.

He looked and acted the part of a pompous oaf, concerned only about his own benefit, and she had to wonder how did he keep his followers fighting for him after like what, 30 years? At least he had the sense to fear her. It was so obvious how he flinched and refused to even look in her direction. The only reason she took this job was for the sack of idols, and she owed Livio a favour. She missed their past days, with all the casual crime and violence.\n\nAfter the ponce and Livio finished discussing in hushed whispers, she was left together with the latter, who was quick to finish elaborating the details of her mission. If this Iovinus was also as arrogant as the griff who just left the room, then the world would be better off.\n\n"Livio, chéri, why do you work for that clown? You could slit his throat and be out of here before you know it." Eugénie reached for his claw, holding it tenderly.\n"He's as terrible as he looks, but the pay is good, and beats sitting in prison. Besides, after you get this done, I'll be free from the contract I have here. Then we can go back to doing what we enjoy most." They exchanged a mutual chuckle at the thought. "Now, shall we conclude our planning? The infiltration route is most important, you can't raise any suspicion before getting into position.""

What a dump this place was, she thought. No wonder it was becoming forgotten. If there was anygriff tracking her, they would have a difficult time keeping up. With a new identity, she would take a different ferry to Calembourg the next day. It felt even slower than the previous one, and Eugénie wondered if that loony griff that harassed her about building a tunnel under the lake had a good idea after all.\n\nThe so called beautiful city of Verenia was hardly worth its name. It was as if nothing was rebuilt in the last decade or two, but fortunately there were plenty of job openings for a "mercenary" she posed as. Specifically, with most of the soldiers sent to the frontline, griffs were needed to guard important places. With little questions asked, Eugénie became the newest member of the Ducal Militia.

Any attempt at interrogation proved fruitless, and somehow the brilliant inventor retained his sanity despite persistent isolation.\n\nThough he got his name in the history books for the partial destruction of Calembourg, it was overshadowed by the remainder of the Verenian Struggle.

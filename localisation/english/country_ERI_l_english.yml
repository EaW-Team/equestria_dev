#### FOCUS

ERI_whats_next:0 "Ending The Stalemate"
ERI_whats_next_desc:0 "Ceasefire has been maintained for the past four years, despite several incidents. The good Duke believes that the time is right to make a change in the status quo, based on the recent information received. Our struggle simply cannot continue, something has to change."
ERI_war_of_course:0 "The Usual Method"
ERI_war_of_course_desc:0 "Might makes right! The only proper way to end the Verenian Struggle after all these years is by force of arms and valour of soldiers. The peasants will be mobilised for the cause, whether they like it or not! A decisive victory will ensure there is no more question about who is the rightful ruler."
ERI_peace_maybe:0 "Give Peace A Chance"
ERI_peace_maybe_desc:0 "Perhaps the choices we've made haven't been the smartest ones. If our soldiers and shells haven't been able to bypass the Aranti riverline defences for so long, alternative options should be considered. The charming Duke should be able to easily convince his rivals into an agreement that benefits him most."
ERI_enforce_levy:0 "Serve Your Duke"
ERI_enforce_levy_desc:0 "Slugs! Worms! The time has come again to throw our great might against that perpetual thorn in my side, Iovinus. As per their obligations, the peasants must be rallied to the cause, armed and equipped to the fullest. They shall support our knights in a glorious charge, and there better be no talk about rights again."
ERI_emergency_conversion:0 "Emergency Production Expansion"
ERI_emergency_conversion_desc:0 "Firearms! Ordnance! Shovels! The soldiers of House Erie always require more equipment for the war effort. Several non-vital production centres will have to be forcibly converted to fulfill these requests, and the Duke will tolerate no delays in the matter."
ERI_up_the_taxes:0 "Increase Noble Obligations"
ERI_up_the_taxes_desc:0 "The Duke isn't one for two-faced behaviour, which is why the nobles sworn to his banner should contribute further for his future great victory. Increased taxes, length of field service and required griffonpower drawn from their ranks are required if we are to claim Verenia in the Duke's name."
ERI_fund_fabrice:0 "Invest In Research"
ERI_fund_fabrice_desc:0 "Fabrice Assaultine, the Duke's Grand Inventor, is a griffon of brilliant thoughts, and he has provided us a great plenty in new technologies and reverse-engineered foreign designs. Surely, we should invest a portion of our yearly income to his private business, so that we may further benefit from his breakthroughs?"
ERI_fund_livio:0 "Expand Information Network"
ERI_fund_livio_desc:0 "Livio Sillègue, although despised by many for his deceptive methods, has been invaluable in unconvering numerous plots from House Eyrie. If it weren't for his eyes and ears, we wouldn't have been prepared for numerous feints and ambushes. If his activities received more coin, then we could count on clearer information in the future."
ERI_mobilise_economy:0 "Necessary Sacrifices"
ERI_mobilise_economy_desc:0 "Nogriff is pleased to do it, but the honest truth is that we must be more conservative with our already limited resources. As much as possible should be diverted towards supporting the war effort, with the knowledge of our complete control of Verenia being our guiding light and motivation for enduring this hardship. One day, it will all be worth it."
ERI_noble_oaths:0 "Rally The Bannergriffs"
ERI_noble_oaths_desc:0 "The Midnight Banner does not stand on its own: the Duke's most loyal followers come from the lesser noble houses, such as the Bonbolet, De Laframboise, Des Groseilles, Du Poivrier and others. Following feudal obligations, they must contribute their household knights in the next assault against House Eyrie, and the Duke will fulfill his side of the arrangement, as agreed."
ERI_approve_plan:0 "Knight-Commander's Course Of Action"
ERI_approve_plan_desc:0 "We haven't fought a war for decades without learning anything. The Duke's esteemed brother, Cyrille, Comte d'Pont-aux-Griffes, has been working hard in hammering down a viable strategy that will allow us to break through the notoriously entrenched riverbank. There are no large scale fortifications owing to a lack of resources, yet the land is intensely difficult to advance through."
ERI_die_iovinus:0 "To End My Sibling"
ERI_die_iovinus_desc:0 "The time is now! This is our moment of triumph! We shall march across the Aranti river and put an end to Iovinus' feeble schemes. Onwards to victory and glory, for the Duke! For Verenia!"
ERI_disarm:0 "Reducing Economic Mobilisation"
ERI_disarm_desc:0 "War creates much business, and it is great for innovation, but it certainly isn't good for the average griff who has to deal with a shortage of supplies and food. Restoring production to average consumer products should calm the masses, and show that their noble lords are most benevolent."
ERI_demobilise:0 "Sending The Soldiers Home"
ERI_demobilise_desc:0 "If we want to show that miser Iovinus that our intentions are genuine, then we must dismiss our forces from the payroll. Let the peasants return to their fields, and the foreign hirelings to return... to wherever they came from. If nothing else, the Duke's purse will get a lot heftier next month."
ERI_approach_for_negotiations:0 "Showing Sincerity"
ERI_approach_for_negotiations_desc:0 "The recent measures have certainly not gone unnoticed by House Eyrie, but the largest obstacle remains convincing them to attend the peace talks. It cannot be done through intermediaries - the two rival claimants must meet face to face if there is any hope of securing a lasting settlement."
ERI_plan_a:0 "Amicable Approach"
ERI_plan_a_desc:0 "Let bygones be bygones, yes? The Duke shall show his magnanimous side, forgive all past wrongs and slights, all for the benefit of peace. Surely, when faced with such abundant generosity, Iovinus will have no choice but to agree to everything we say? Vincent, you're so brilliant..."
ERI_plan_b:0 "Tepid Approach"
ERI_plan_b_desc:0 "There has been a lot of bad blood between Houses Erie and Eyrie. Nothing can change that, and nothing can bring back all the brave griffons who died for the cause. We've made the first move in extending a claw, but we expect Iovinus to show some good will and forgiveness of his own."
ERI_plan_c:0 "Aggressive Approach"
ERI_plan_c_desc:0 "Iovinus is but a weak, feeble minded simpleton. He's fallen right for my trap, and now we have him exactly where we wanted. A little blackmail here, and a little push there, and Verenia will be united with great amount of guile. I couldn't have thought of a better idea myself, and if Livio says it was his idea, he's lying!"
ERI_approach_avian:0 "Invite Katrina To Talks"
ERI_approach_avian_desc:0 "Who would have thought that the settlement process has gone far smoother than expected? A tentative agreement has been reached, but now we require the third party to join us. To complete the unification of Verenia, Lady Katrina must attend our peace talks. Given her soft nature, she is very unlikely to reject the idea."
ERI_end_to_the_war:0 "To End The Struggle"
ERI_end_to_the_war_desc:0 "The most incredible outcome! Nogriff believed it, but Duke Vincent has managed to outmanoeuvre his competitors, with both House Eyrie and House Avian agreeing to accept his compromises. After all these years, Verenia shall be united, led by the most competent successor!"

ERI_we_fucked_up_again:0 "The Fifth Ceasefire"
ERI_we_fucked_up_again_desc:0 "Amidst the confusion, chaos and revolt - once more, we are forced to settle for the most ignoble outcome - a bitter return to "peace". What good is this peace when it won't bring back the griffons who died, or fix the damage caused by uprisings? There can be no half-measures past this point: the next assault is our death, or glory. The Duke will be taking a personal claw in the matter."

ERI_the_yale_connection:0 "Fabrice's Connections"
ERI_the_yale_connection_desc:0 "For all the vexations the Grand Inventor causes to Erie's nobility, it cannot be denied that his research produces actual results. Thus, it would be prudent to check if the latest funding from the Duke's purse resulted in some tangible benefit for House Erie, that would allow us to make amends for the most recent setback."
ERI_invite_old_colleagues:0 "Alumni Of Yale"
ERI_invite_old_colleagues_desc:0 "Brilliance often comes with a disparaging attitude for authority and norms, it would seem. Indeed, it's become somewhat of a trend to hear of promising graduates from the universities of Yale, who end up forced to work far beneath their capabilities for one reason or another. Fabrice has been wondering if some of these old colleagues could be invited here."
ERI_the_golden_mean:0 "Responsible Research"
ERI_the_golden_mean_desc:0 "The Duke holds great fondness for his Grand Inventor, but he realises that House Erie is on a tight budget. It would bring Verenia further glory to be the place of a new scientific revolution, but those are currently distant dreams. Fabrice will have to work with what can be spared."
ERI_no_limits_go_brrrrr:0 "Limits (And Ethics) Be Damned"
ERI_no_limits_go_brrrrr_desc:0 "Progress is a constant that is always sought after, yet never fully in reach. Why should we restrain ourselves in pursuit of victory? Anything and everything must be done to ensure we have an edge over our rivals. The Grand Inventor will have everything he desires, but there will be a strict deadline to ensure our investment comes to a satisfying conclusion."
ERI_tech_for_people:0 "Share The Progress"
ERI_tech_for_people_desc:0 "Who said we aren't generous overlords? Scientific discoveries are meant to be distributed far and wide, to inspire awe and fear! For now, we'll have to think a little smaller. Fabrice has taken a small break from his daydreaming, to write up a coherent program for teaching the masses. Of course, nothing dangerously thought provoking, just the basic things everygriff should know. Such as, respect your leaders."
ERI_licences:0 "Foreign Designs"
ERI_licences_desc:0 "Our goals would be far easier if the majority of arms dealers and banks across Griffonia didn't refuse to work with us. Boreas, it's not our fault we can't pay our debts on time, we're fighting a war! However, there is an alternative: bypassing private enterprises and working directly with a foreign government. There must be somegriff in the Aquileian mainland that will heed the plea of its distant relatives."
ERI_grand_experiment:0 "Spark Of Ingenuity"
ERI_grand_experiment_desc:0 "Numbers and stategies mean little when one side has a decisive technological advantage. Having worked for a long time on his most bold and audacious project thus far, the Grand Inventor has a proposal for the Duke that he'll find very difficult to refuse. Previous small scale demonstrations have been promising, now all that's needed is commitment and no small amount of resources."

ERI_indominable_spirit:0 "Hoist The Standard High"
ERI_indominable_spirit_desc:0 "The Midnight Banner has been bloodied, but not broken! We shall regroup, we shall come together, we shall never yield! Losses will be replaced, training shall resume in the earnest, the House of Erie shall fall only once when the last paladin perishes! Let us see to our preparations, lest our great Duke grows further displeased."
ERI_weed_out_the_weak:0 "Balancing The Needs"
ERI_weed_out_the_weak_desc:0 "Domestic economy is largely undefined and left to the whims of lesser nobles. As long as their estates and properties were managed sufficiently enough for the taxes, the Duke didn't really involve himself in the matter. However, this was always intended as a temporary measure until Verenia was united, and now we should make the first step in solving this problem."
ERI_bone_for_plebs:0 "Ease Up On The Peasants"
ERI_bone_for_plebs_desc:0 "The good people are tired of war and its endless provisions, which is all fair and fine, if we weren't pressed for every claw to our service. Recent instability, however, has shown that some wishes need to be fulfilled. For the time being, our gentler side will be shown to the masses, but we'll make up for the losses through other means."
ERI_fires_of_war:0 "Expand The Requirements"
ERI_fires_of_war_desc:0 "It. Is. Not. Enough. The good people may becry our choices, but no conflict was won through pleasant words and comfortable indulgences. Everygriff that can be pressed into some kind of service - they will be pressed, and hard! All unneeded frivolities shall be cut down upon, as well. The greatest force Verenia has ever seen will be brought through our sacrifice."
ERI_hedge_knights:0 "Wandering Soldiers"
ERI_hedge_knights_desc:0 "War isn't waged just for pride and prestige. Rather, some unscrupulous individuals fight for the thrill of battle, and the promise of payment. Such was the case when the old Empire broke, leaving many armed griffs without employment. Now, a band of these desperate stragglers make their way to the Court of Erie, seeking a patron willing to fill their pockets."
ERI_new_blood:0 "Fresh Recruits"
ERI_new_blood_desc:0 "They could not have been ready in time for the last assault, but the newest regiments have been trained to the standards set by our illustrious Knight-Commander. After a short ceremony for the newly minted paladins, they shall take their place among their comrades-in-arms. Hope they will be enough to overcome the difficult situation ahead of us."
ERI_relief_fund:0 "Carrot And Stick"
ERI_relief_fund_desc:0 "The virtues of nobility are exemplified by their treatment of the lesser and less fortunate classes. It is our humble obligation to provide for them, as they shall in return provide service and obedience. Should they act unruly, however, our generosity will have to be cut short. Let us hope they see the facts of life."
ERI_discipline:0 "Standards Of Paladins"
ERI_discipline_desc:0 "A paladin fights not only for their lord, but also their homeland, friends, families and more. Reminding our brave soldiers of their noble causes should inspire them to give their fullest effort in the coming battle. There can be no other choice."
ERI_ride_for_glory:0 "Bravery, Temerity, Dignity, Guide Us!"
ERI_ride_for_glory_desc:0 "A righteous cause is always worth fighting and dying for. A day may come when the bravery of griffon knights fails, but it is not this day. Embrace your closest, say goodbye to your children, for today, we march against immeasurable odds - and we shall be victorious! Advance against the world's ruin, for greatness has not yet perished, glory and courage! For our beautiful Verenia!"

ERI_cloak_and_dagger:0 "Livio's Machinations"
ERI_cloak_and_dagger_desc:0 "Nogriff really knows how far the spymaster's schemes go. Not even he is aware of every agent or criminal in his service, for he works through many proxies and intermediaries. Disorganised as it seems, it is ultimately to our benefit, as he is able to provide us with goods and information we couldn't seize through legitimate means."
ERI_expand_agency:0 "Increase Subterfuge Capabilities?"
ERI_expand_agency_desc:0 "The spymaster has been grumbling about his inadequate options concerning his role for quite some time. Livio is doing his work as best as he possibly can, but the few rooms given to him in the Château's west wing are reaching their limits. He has expressed a desire to have a more independent agency, suited for his needs."
ERI_infiltrate_the_hof:0 "Happy Little Accidents"
ERI_infiltrate_the_hof_desc:0 "A state consists of many parts, from its leader to the lowliest of clerks fetching paperwork. Far more than most realise, these "lowly" griffs are perhaps crucial to the wellbeing of a community, office or factory floor. If some of these were to disappear quietly, it wouldn't raise much overt concern."
ERI_sleepers_everywhere:0 "Revolutions Without Cause"
ERI_sleepers_everywhere_desc:0 "It is no secret that the peasantry has been griping about the conditions on both sides of the Aranti river. Why wouldn't they? Living conditions have steadily deteriorated over the years, trust in leadership has never been lower. Which is precisely what we can exploit to spread some unrest in Iovinus' holds."
ERI_among_the_people:0 "The Magnanimous Duke"
ERI_among_the_people_desc:0 "Sometimes, even great and wise leaders have to make appearances in public, to persuade their underlings that they ostensibly care about them. It is also an opportunity to lessen some wrongs, show a generous side, and much more! The question is, will the Duke deign to appear for the rabble, or will he rather stay at home?"
ERI_selective_destruction:0 "Misery Makes Great Company"
ERI_selective_destruction_desc:0 "Preparation is the most important part of any plan, and what better way to amplify our chances of success than to ruin theirs? Subverting House Eyrie at their every move will help out the ducal soldiers, especially when they notice that their foe has been waylaid, or greatly lacking in supplies."
ERI_the_job:0 "Most Dangerous Game"
ERI_the_job_desc:0 "For the past decades, war has been waged countless times, and uneasy peace followed each time, in a most vicious cycle of misery that's left both griffon and nature scarred. We have not fought to destroy Verenia, but to liberate it! The Ducal Spymaster has arranged through his contacts a most devious solution that will end the problem.\nPermanently."

#### DECISIONS & DECISION CATEGORIES

ERI_the_conflict:0 "The Succession of Verenia"
ERI_the_conflict_desc:0 "For almost three decades, the proud and haughty patriarch of House Erie, Vincent, has led a campaign of brutal warfare in an effort to claim the entirety of Verenia for himself, and teach that insolent whelp Iovinus a lesson in respect. The roots of this stalemate can be traced to the bloody revolution of 978, which led to the deaths of many prominent nobles and dignitaries, leaving only two candidates with the lawful claim to the Verenian legacy. With no major power willing to intervene on his behalf, and the unexpected secession of his northern lands under the leadership of Lady Avian, the self-styled Duke of Erie must rely on his own martial strength and no small amount of guile if he is to succeed. Assisting him in this regard are his most trusted advisors, who nonetheless bicker with each other for the Duke's influence, the lesser noble families who serve more out of obligation and promises of expanded holdings than loyalty, all while a tired class of peasants and middle class city dwellers wish for peace. Should the impoverished griffons be pushed to the limit with taxation and conscription, a §Rrevolution§! seems likely to occur. \n\nThe §rKnight-Commander§! is currently [Root.ERI_cyrille_support_dynamic_loc].\nThe §DGrand Inventor§! is currently [Root.ERI_fabrice_support_dynamic_loc].\nThe §gDucal Spymaster§! is currently [Root.ERI_livio_support_dynamic_loc].\n\nThe §ONobility of Erie§! are currently [Root.ERI_noble_support_dynamic_loc] with the Duke.\nThe dissatisfaction of the §Llower classes§! is currently [Root.ERI_peasant_rage_dynamic_loc]."

#### IDEAS & ADVISORS & DESIGN COMPANIES

E_E_rivalry_erie:0 "War Of Two Houses"
E_E_rivalry_erie_desc:0 "§RTwo households, both alike in dignity,\nFrom ancient grudge break to new mutiny,\nWhere civil blood makes civil claws unclean.§!\n\nThe bitter feud between the rival houses of Eyrie and Erie - both houses as irreconcilable to each other as the Sun and Moon, day and night - has led to decades of incessant internecine violence between the two heavily militarised houses. Both leaders of the houses claim to be the rightful and legitimate Duke of Verenia, and both of them refuse to negotiate with each other. The violence will likely continue until one side proves triumphant."
hardcore_feudalism:0 "Entrenched Feudal Relations"
hardcore_feudalism_desc:0 "Even as revolutions and change swept across Griffonia, the rulers of Verenia have been extremely reactionary in clamping down on the evils of republicanism and democracy. Technological progress is encouraged solely on the condition that it does not interfere with the established social order, leading to the region being perceived as backwards compared to their neighbours."

not_our_war:0 "Clamour For Peace"
not_our_war_desc:0 "The war for Verenia has dragged on for a seemingly indefinite amount of time, even after many conflicts in surrounding regions ceased. As a result, the growing middle class and the landed peasantry are extremely hesitant to fight in the service of what they perceive to be an uncaring ruler, wishing nothing more than a return to normalcy and peace. Replenishment and recruitment of new regiments is quite difficult as a result, and the only reliable units are ones on the Duke's personal paycheck."

ERI_knight_commander_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 30th of April, 959 in Calembourg\n§YRank§!: Paladin-Commandant de la Maison Erie\n\n§YBiography§!: Fondly known among his fellow peers and common soldiers as the "hero of many battles", Cyrille is the younger brother to the duc d'Erie, widely regarded as a paragon of chivalry and gallantry. It is noted that without his brilliant tactical leadership, House Erie would have long perished, and it is thanks to Cyrille, the cities of Pont-aux-Griffes and Erie resisted three sieges over the course of ten years. The tale many recount at dinners and outings is one at the second siege of Pont-aux-Griffes, where the Comte held the bridge with a small group of knights against a vastly superior Eyrian force.\n\nIn spite of his almost legendary exploits, Cyrille remains unclouded from delusions of grandeur. His sole commitment remains the furthering the cause of his liege lord, distancing himself from the politicking and schemes in the ducal court. When it comes to management and paperwork, Cyrille usually delegates the responsibility, preferring to concentrate on his training and family. Regardless of his immense propaganda value, the Comte continues charging headlong into the next battle, leading the troops under his command wondering if he has a suppressed death wish, or simply vicious bloodthirsty tendencies.\n\nThus, the Comte d'Pont-aux-Griffes remains an instrumental griffon for the continued success of House Erie.\n\n"

Such was the case with Livio Sillègue - coming from a family of vintners who made good trading in Vinovia. In a happy tale, they would have prospered and remained satisfied, if not for an ultimately unfortunate trip to the Périphérie in pursuit of a market expansion. Caught in the revolution's outbreak, they were targetted by insurgents mistaking them for nobles due to their opulent outlook. Livio was the only one who survived the massacre. Clawing his way out of the caravan with little more than his clothing and a few idols, he was not seen or heard for many years.\n\nIt is unknown what he did to survive, but Livio would eventually find himself locked in Château Erie's deepest dungeons, wanted for several charges of murder, arson, robbery and other heinous crimes. Execution was certain, if not for an offer from Duke Vincent himself: put his underground connections to the cause of House Erie, or face oblivion. It was an open secret that Livio was hunting down the perpetrators of the worst day in his life, and to that end, he became quite skilled in collecting information (though he mostly used it for satisfying violent outbursts). Unwilling to forsake his revenge, he would take on the Duke's offer, much to the dismay of his fellow courtiers, forced to put up with a criminal only barely adhering to the proper decorum.\n\n"

But those close to Vincent would confirm his eloquence and learned mind, exceptional generosity to griffons who have served him well, and above all, an unshakeable desire to see Verenia flourish like in the times of old. Some even say that he can be very charming when it suits him, though Vincent has yet to secure marriage even after he passed 50 years of age.

#### EVENTS

erie.1.t:0 "An Introduction To A Sordid Tale"
erie.1.d:0 "My name is Vincent, the true duke of Verenia. For decades, I've waged a war of unmatched ferocity and fervour over these lands against my accursed half-brother, Iovinus, the false duke. In the past, our ancestors have ruled Verenia and its lush plains, lucrative river trade routes and splendid cities, whose grandeur only increased after we swore fealty to the rising Groverian Empire. However, everything changed after those filthy, uppity revolutionaries tore through the region, and left most of my family hanging on trees, including poor father. With the line of succession unclear, and my vacuous brother unwilling to submit, there was no choice but to fight for the title.\n\nAlas, victory was within my grasp, if it weren't for that trollop Katrina, who absconded with a sizeable portion of my property and soldiers. The endless stalemate developed, and Verenia fell behind in terms of development and population. Indeed, I've even heard that in distant corners of Griffonia, they make jokes of two dunderhead dukes fighting over worthless rocks. To this I say, nay! They do not realise the beauty of this land, which I dearly love with all my heart. I'd love nothing more to see it restored to what it once was, even if in the end I'm forced to submit to some other rising tyrant.\n\nFortunately, my few and faithful retainers (the same cannot be said about the worthless peasants who keep complaining) work tirelessly in achieving the noble goal. Alongside the noble families who are sworn to the Erian Midnight Banner, the most notable griffons in this House are my biological younger brother Cyrille (who in spite of his stuffy attitude, he is a very brave and capable commander), a brilliant mind named Fabrice (provides me with new inventions and drinking company on weekends) and Livio, the court rat (his schemes have not always produced the required information, but he is too valuable to dispose of).\nThese are my capabilities, and I shall stop at nothing to achieve my rightful claim to the throne."
erie.1.a:0 "Let us finish this, once and for all."

erie.2.t:0 "Cyrille's Grand Plan"
erie.2.d:0 ""To conclude, gentlegriffs, our strategy concerns itself primarily with the capture of fortress Eyrie. Paladins will lead multiple assaults over the riverfront, with concentrated artillery strikes at their weakest defences, while I shall hold the elite knights in reserve, ready to strike once their soldiers move to support northward. With the capture of their main fortification, nothing shall stand in our way to force them in a most inglorious surrender." Peered over an extensive map of the Aranti river, Knight-Commander Cyrille of the Erian Household Guard finished his proposal. "Are there any questions?"\n\nShuffling in their chairs, his subordinates, as well as his liege lord, Vincent of Erie, seemed satisfied with the proposal. Lacking other options, everygriff wanted nothing more that a swift conclusion to the decades of warfare - in their favour, of course. Yet doubting thoughts did not yield so easily, as one of the paladins spoke.\n\n"The ruse is too obvious, they won't weaken their defence lynchpin, even if we committed entirely. Iovinus gains nothing from moving off that hill, and might simply launch his own counterattack once we broke through the riverline. And what of Lady Katrina? Will she stand idly once again, or has she plotted something nefarious?"\n\nJust so, the illusion of confidence cracked. Nogriff wanted another folly from 3 years ago. Much has been invested since that time, in both research and information gathering, and who could say how much more could the status quo endure? Options were weighted, forces were adjusted, and in the end, an effective compromise was reached.\n\nAs always, it would just have to do. Honour and duty demanded it."
erie.2.a:0 "We hold faith in the valour of our soldiers, and the skill of our leaders."

erie.3.t:0 "Yet Another Setback"
erie.3.d:0 "This was going to be the day. This was it! The culmination of his efforts and desires! Vincent Erie would have his vengeance, and all of Verenia would finally be his. Confidently strutting in his workroom, the only thing left to do was await the arrival of an herald proclaiming victory.\n\nAnd not a moment too soon, there was already a knock on the door, followed by a frightened-looking messenger carrying multiple envelopes. "Ah, servant! Has the battle gone well? Is that cur Iovinus finally in a cage where he belongs? Give me the news now!" Alas, the retainer was too cowed by his superior leadership skills and could only meekly deliver his missives. Wasting little time, the Duc tore off seals from letters and began reading.\n\n"Peasant revolts... front broken... full retreat ordered... truce declared?!"\n\nThe shocking turnabout was too much for the Duc to handle, furiously throwing the papers into the fireplace, followed by slamming his claws on his prized mahogany table. This could not stand. He has waged an epic campaign of warfare and leisure, and his idiotic, pathetic excuse of a brother refused to give in! There could be no more half-measures. Remembering that the peasant griffon was still sharing his quarters, he issued a quick and imposing bark, as befitting a griffon of his stature and authority:\n\n"Servant! Bring everygriff who matters to these chambers, now."\n"W-which ones, my liege?"\nOh how the Duc hated incompetence. "Every. Single. One. The Knight-Commander, the Spymaster, the Grand Inventor, the paladins in the field who aren't dead or dying, anygriff who does something in the court! Now get moving before I cut your wages!"\nSatisfied that his unquestionable supremacy sent the lowly servant to a dart, Vincent moved to his comfortable resting chair to formulate the next course of action. And of course, the scoldings he would give to his underlings."
erie.3.a:0 ""Can't anygriff do anything right?!""

erie.4.t:0 "The Faults In Our Actions"
erie.4.d:0 "As the horrid day shifted to a mercurial evening, the Duc's quarters slowly became filled with griffs of various stature and state of well-being. There stood Cyrille, huddled with his subordinates Keu, Dugrain, d'Étang and others Vincent cared not to remember at the moment. Some were clutching bloody wounds, but not his sibling alright, oh no, getting injured was an affront to a valiant knight. Or perhaps he simply hid it very well under his armour. Fabrice and Livio occupied one of the minor tables, with the ducal egghead holding several papers in front of a rather bored looking spymaster. Meanwhile, a few members of the lesser noble families mingled amongst themselves, looking rather clueless to the point of this meeting, but did it matter? Vincent decided enough had gathered for a proper rebuke by his indomitable authority.\n\n"Well, everygriff? What is the meaning of this? All of you have assured me that we were prepared, that this time for sure, House Eyrie would be trampled under our assault. Yet, we are undone because of what, a few peasant riots? I hope there's a very good explanation for this."\nJust like that, murmurs and whispers ceased, replaced with an uncomfortable silence, only interrupted by the ticking of an imported Macawian clock. It would have gone on for quite some time, if the bold knight didn't step in to the fray.\n\n"My liege, please, do not blame your brave soldiers. We all fought gloriously, spurred on by a righteous cause, but we were undermined by circumstances not within our control. Namely, the rat Livio provided us with faulty information! Pluck his feathers and flog him!"\nAmusing how the supposed icon of chivalry didn't see himself above passing the guilt, and with that, the cacophony was released.\n"My fault? It's not my fault your featherbrain can't read simple reports! Maybe you should slam your head on the wall less!"\n"House Bonbolet was always your favourite, my lord! Please forgive us!"\n"I say we teach the peasants a lesson! Torch their houses and fields!"\n"Does anygriff have spare bandages?! I beg you, Lothaire got shot in the wing!"\n"Fools! While you argue like ponies, Iovinus only gains! It won't be long before he burns down Château Erie!"\n\nSpoiled, insipid children. Vincent had to act before it came to blows and scrapes. With a mighty bellow that silenced the lesser underlings, he would spread his claws over the elegant table and cowed them all into submission.\n"I do not care whose fault is it, because it is clear and obvious, all of you have failed in some manner. You will return to your posts, fix your egregious mistakes, and then we can do this properly. By Eyr, we've been stuck at this for over 30 years, you think we would have learned something already. Now...""
erie.4.a:0 ""Out! All of you, begone!""

erie.5.t:0 "Workshop Of Wonders"
erie.5.d:0 "The sting of failure still lingered in Vincent's mind, but it was best not to dwell on it for too long. After all, he spent the previous two days indulging in the contents of his wine cellar, where a particular Francistrian vintage caught his attention. Now, the time is right to get back to work, and pay a visit to his most trusted servants. Taking a more personal claw in the matter will ensure nothing's left to chance next time.\n\nMilling through the streets of Erie (the Duke had a little internal giggle each time he reminded himself of the city's egotistic naming), Vincent would make his way to the local branch of Ateliers Avault. No doubt, Fabrice was well on his way towards discovering an ingenious weapon that would smite Iovinus to scorching pieces! Or more likely, nursing a hangover from last night.\n\nWhat he didn't expect, as he entered into the workshop's main hall, was an arc of lightning striking not even an arm's length away from him! Vincent briefly felt his life instantly passing over his eyes, with a scattered prayer to Eyr, until his stupor was interrupted by the familiar smooth voice, slowly gaining in closeness.\n\n"Apologies, mon Duc! What you've just witnessed is my latest and greatest creation! It came onto me in a dream, no doubt granted by Boreas Himself! Still a work in progress, though..."\n"Aaaaaaah... Fabrice! What have I told you about safety measures? I could have been seriously hurt!"\nIf the brilliant inventor seemed phased, he didn't quite show it. "Nonsense, friend! I'm not much for medical science, but I'm sure I would have been able to treat any... non-serious wounds. That's the best I could promise. Now then, what is the purpose of my Duke's visit to this humble shrine of science? It's far too early for leisure, is it not?"\nOh yes, Vincent would have loved some casual games accompanied by imported Skyfall whiskey and cigars. But later on that, this time he meant business. "Not now, Fabrice, but I do have something most excellent to show you for that time. I'm here to discuss our immediate plans for House Erie and how your work should fit into it. May we speak in privately?"\nInstructing his workers to take care of the machinery, the loyal servant would guide his employer through the maze-like hallways. "I was certain we would triumph this time, but fortune did not favour us. I've been working on something to even the odds, but we need more of your generous investments...""
erie.5.a:0 ""Your clever mind has rarely failed to deliver, dear friend.""

erie.6.t:0 "Less Visited Corridors"
erie.6.d:0 "Vincent didn't quite understand what Fabrice explained to him over charts and diagrams, but it certainly seemed promising and flashy! Though, he'd have to decide if he really wanted to fund this escapade, the last one did not end particularly well for anygriff involved... and that poor pony. Shaking his head to dispel a haunting memory, the Duke was quick to return to his estates.\n\nInteracting with that criminal Sillègue was never pleasant, but it was necessary, he was quick to remind himself. Vincent would find Livio sequestered in the château's east wing, far from any noble company (who despised the griff on principle). Ignoring the shady figures who passed so often beside him, informants probably, the Spymaster's hideout contrasted sharply to the workshop he just left. Meticulously ordered and devoid of gaieties, the room was dominated by endless stacks of papers, several boards hanging from walls which contained pinned notes and photographs. The griffon behind all of this seemed to brood in his chair, sharpening his claws with a knife.\n"Ah... my Duke. Are you here about the recent failures? I assure you, I've done my work as you requested."\nVincent was not feeling eager to get in the range of that dagger, so he stayed put at the doorway. "Partially. Was it true what Cyrille said, that you've given them false information?"\n"That bird couldn't tell day or night apart once he's high on his knightly mania. We captured some fools across the river and interrogated them, as usual."\nAs usual, yes. A familiar thread presented itself. "Did you torture them? I don't care for your methods, but you are aware they'll say anything to make it stop."\nIf Livio was perturbed at all by moral constraints, his cold glare confirmed otherwise. "I did what I needed to do. Nothing more."\n"You lack finesse, Sillègue. You've done good work so far in earning your freedom, but you made some missteps at crucial moments. That can't happen anymore, we cannot afford any more stalemates against Iovinus. I expect you to do better in the coming months."\n\nAcknowledging a grunt as confirmation, the Duke would turn to leave, but not before inquiring one last time. "As for your personal investigation... I trust it won't interfere with your primary responsibility?" There was a small clatter as the wicked knife fell on the floor."

erie.7.d:0 "Dealing with Livio's hostile attitude was always something that deserved a drink or two, but Vincent had to press on with his responsibilities. Learning from the château's châtelaine that his esteemed sibling was touring the riverside, he would set out to join him, taking no personal guard alongside him, to not attract any attention of course.\n\nIt was both a blessing from Boreas and a curse from Maar that the great river flowed so closely from his holdings, though the location itself had few good things to say about it. Dreary and wearisome, holes dotted the blasted countryside intermixed with snaking trenches and small scale bunkers. Even the sky itself was clouded in a melancholic grey, the only colours of life he could spot were fallen pennants and banners, still clinging to those who carried them. How many met their demise here? The living few seemed like shadows, collecting lifeless husks of griffons for burial and equipment retrieval, but Vincent paid them no heed as he climbed an imposing hill.\n\nAs expected, Cyrille occupied this strategic redoubt, his precious honour guard watching the perimeter. Clad in gleaming panoply and armed with various polearms, their purpose seemed only to look imposing and harken to a bygone time. Brushing past the watching statues, Vincent would join his brother, both peering across the gloomy waters.\n"Dear Cyrille, why would you return to this horrid frontline? I feel that a prolonged time here could choke a griff in sorrow."\n"Our duty compels us to never falter, Vincent. I hold little love for the battlefield—", his bloodstained tabard suggested otherwise, "—yet I know one day, we'll restore life to fair Verenia, the war but a distant memory of a frigid Winter. I have faith in the strength of Erian knights, and all who march with us to death and glory. Speaking of which, I am here to oversee the marshalling of our defences, and give proper respects to the fine griffons who gave their lives." He would then lean on his cruel looking halberd.\n"That is all fine and well, Cyrille, but I need you back at the château within the week. I trust you'll conclude your business in a timely manner?" Vincent wanted nothing more right now than the comfort of his fireplace.\n"Oh, of course. Do watch your head when you leave, my scouts spotted some forces milling at the other side. Wouldn't want harm to befall our good leader, yes?""

erie.8.d:0 ""I'll say, my Duke, I am always too glad when you spare some time for our evening indulgences.", the Grand Inventor intoned in a jolly mood, in-between shuffling a stack of cards and refilling the shot glasses.\n"Think nothing of it, Fabrice, this is perhaps my only time to relax. Cyrille with his knightly nonsense in the morning, nobles and their prattle at noon, Livio with his passive aggressive attitude in the afternoon. If I weren't so invested in our struggles, I would have took my idols and moved to the Meridiennes a long time ago. Pass me the spirits, and do continue with that story of yours."\n\nVincent would usually say that rulers have no friends, only subjects and enemies, but Fabrice was anything but that. Professional when needed, amicable when in private, and all too reassuring despite the recent string of doom and gloom. Taking the fourth, or was it fifth, glass of Skyfall whiskey, he would contently rest his head on a claw and listen.\n\n"Naturally! There we were, right after stealing the dean's powdered wig, pondering on what to do with it. One of my colleagues said, 'Fabrice, you should just put it on your prototype clockwork!', and everygriff laughed at the idea! That curmudgeonly old bird deserved to be kicked a notch down... well, he did get kicked down, but so was I, for the first time. Maybe not my best idea." If he seemed to regret that, Fabrice didn't show it over his chuckling.\n\nThe idea of a machine wearing a wig gave Vincent quite the lark as well. "So, why don't you just invite your former friends? As in, here, to work with us? They seem like a clever bunch, though not as much as you."\n"Huh? Oh, yes! That would be a splendid idea! I am also reminded, I just finished today turning your investments into something useful. Care to hear? Our scientific breakthrough was quite astonishing."\nBut the Duke would only wave his claw at that. "Give me the paperwork when I leave, I'll read it tomorrow. Now, I am feeling particularly fortunate about this set of cards, so I will increase my bet...""

erie.9.d:0 "Château Erie's courtyard was an informal rally point for the household soldiers, yet Vincent did not know why his esteemed sibling gathered many on such a dismal day. To his credit, Cyrille and his paladin entourage looked like they haven't fought in a war only weeks ago, with their gleaming armour and heavy firearms slung over their backs. Yet the same couldn't be said about the griffs in attendance, many wearing casts and bandages, the poor rabble. Perhaps, he would simply listen and observe the commotion from a discreet vantage point.\n\n"I know what you're thinking, griffons—", the valorous captain began, in that same tone Vincent considered annoying, "—how could we have failed? Didn't you just recently hear, how the Erian warriors would be dining in Calembourg by the end of Summer?" A low groan was heard, as expected. "You did not fail, my friends. For there is nothing, no force, no weapon or alliance that can withstand the greatest virtue known to griffonkind - courage!" That seemed to have roused their spirits, if by a little. "All of you here, you fought bravely, in the proud legacy of your ancestors who defied Arantigans, Aquileians and others, and returned to tell the tale! I will personally assure all of you, the next battle will be ours, and the world will know that House Erie boasts the finest soldiers!"\n\nThe Duke wasn't quite impressed or even inspired by this rabble-rousing speech, but the same could not be said for the others. Many stood straighter and bolder, giving their salutes, a gleam of hope in their eyes. "Even now, more flock to join the cause of the Midnight Banner. Do you wish to be the ones to let down your comrades-in-arms?" A thunderous 'no!' was heard, as if they were one. Perhaps, thought Vincent, perhaps there is still a chance. One last opportunity to do it properly."

Demands from city leaders for funding, invitations to the nobles' soirées, casualty reports from the front, when would it end? To make it even worse, his goblet had ran dry and that lazy servant hasn't showed up in the last hour.\n\nJust when the Duke was about to call it a night, a thin envelope with meticulous writing got his attention. This was the signature form of Livio, who abhorred giving reports in person, and preferred to do everything by letters and agents. Probably for the best, given how many griffs he managed to get upset in the previous month. Actually, was there anygriff who even liked him? That idea gave Vincent plenty of food for thought as he removed the wax seal and got reading.\n\n"Mon Duc,\nDespite the decreased resources given to me in the previous months, one of my agents has returned from her assignment with a promising prize. She told me that the information was obtained from a heavily guarded stronghold in Vinovia, and after personal analysis, I can confirm its value. It has been passed on to relevant griffs, and you may find further details on the back of this page.\n—Maître-Espion Ducal Livio Sillègue""

Will you provide for them as we discussed recently?"\n\nAh. Vincent had hoped that Fabrice would have forgotten that particular empty promise he had made under the influence. It was all too easy to be charming, except when you had to actually own up to your words. Unfortunately, as he was in the middle of a luncheon with House Erie's cream of the crop (Livio was not invited), the question could not be put aside, as many eyes were now on their Duke.\n\n"Monsieur le Duc d'Erie", chortled one of the attending nobles, from House De La Framboise, "I believe the allocation of our dwindling treasury was discussed at the court just yesterday. Would it truly be wise to lavish what we cannot right now?"\n\nMaar's claws take them! Vincent could no longer pretend to savour the flavour of Wingbardian white truffle tagliatelle (enhanced with butter and aged cheese, his personal chef was worth every idol), the decision had to be made before the guests got rowdy. Waving with his claw while taking a sip of his favourite tannic red, he would take a quick glance over the attendees, stopping for the briefest moment at Fabrice's earnest gaze.\n"Excusez-moi, dear allies. The meal is simply to die for, and we are all too blessed to be together on this wonderful day. As for your inquiries, I've decided that...""

Can't you just build the designs yourself?"\n\nCyrille, standing next to his sibling, nodded in agreement. "House Erie is short on supplies as is, we can't afford to chase this flight of fancy. Besides, my paladins don't need these gizmos, our valour and training is more than enough."\n\nIf the brilliant inventor seemed dissuaded, he did not show it with his enthusiastic gestures over various photographs and blueprints. "But, Messieurs, can't you see? I could not develop these materiel in time to be relevant, and we need every advantage. If we could obtain just a small amount of either tanks or planes, Iovinus wouldn't be able to fight back!"\n\n"While honour does not preclude tactics, we would be gaining these weapons on such a short notice. Our soldiers have no experience using them, and you would essentially throw them into the onslaught unprepared. I would suggest, mon Duc, to simply invest in our domestic mining industry. More resources, more work for the peasants, no risk of importing Aquileian revolutionism." Cyrille sneered in disdain at the thought.\n\nThe day when any of his underlings all agreed on something was the day Vincent would send Iovinus a birthday present. Why couldn't they work together instead of acting stubborn and bickering over minutiae? Oh well, the Duke enjoyed being the arbiter, it was a clear reinforcement of his authority. Having made the decision in his mind, Vincent addressed the room."

Only thing, though, was that he did not know at all that was going on inside those many workshops, only that the price has been rather painful for his purse.\n\nNo matter, because today, a hastily written note was handed to the Duke from a courier, urging him 'to visit Fabrice at the earliest opportunity, for a wonderful weapon that would secure the dominion of Verenia is completed'. That put a smile on his beak, and without delay, Vincent would take to the skies, forgoing decorum to see at once what he was promised.\n\nAteliers Avault was busy like on any other day, but the frantic crowd parted like the sea before their liege lord, who was in great haste to reach his brilliant subordinate. He would find him in the workshop's main hall, tinkering at a strange contraption.\n\n"Fabrice, my good friend. I've received your letter and got here as soon as I could. Forgive the old wings, they're not as good as they used to be."\n"Ah, mon Duc! I am too glad that you are here. Fear not, you didn't miss out on anything. I must profusely thank you for all the trust and investment you've placed in me, for I believe it has now paid off. What you are looking at is the weapon that shall crush Iovinus into dust and ashes."\nVincent was not quite sure what he was looking at, maybe he was still dizzy from the frantic flight?

erie.20.d:0 ""Some of you have asked me recently, what is the distinction between a paladin and a knight? Do we not both use the same equipment and tactics? The simple answer is, no, there is no functional difference. We are the same, but with a different coat of paint, you might say.\n\nHowever, there are a few things that set us apart from our cousins in Herzland or Aquileia. First, the paladins maintain a tradition of service from the founding days of Verenia. Armour has gotten better and sturdier, certainly, and polearms and axes have been replaced with heavy calibre firearms, but our role remained the same: a vanguard of the few but brave, leading the charge from the front.\n\nSecondarily, the paladins maintain their strong allegiances to their liege lords and the Gods. A paladin without a master is certainly considered a disgrace, but that can be corrected. However, one cannot truly be a paladin without devoting themselves to the Gods, be it one in particular or all of them. Always remember that Boreas, Arcturius and Eyr are watching, and we must earn their favour through righteous battle.\n\nAs you may have noted as well, from the appearance of myself and my subordinates... a paladin has to maintain some sense of style, no? It does you no credit to run around looking like a haggard blackguard who scavenged armour from a corpse. For those of you who are interested, I have plenty of knowledge in improving appearances..."\n\n—From the lectures of Comte Absolon Cyrille d'Amphitre, Paladin-Commandant de la Maison Erie"

erie.21.d:0 "It was not every day House Erie would be providing hospitality to visiting guests, due to the long standing isolation brought by decades of warfare. Owing to desperation perhaps, these guests are the little known sellswords that go by the moniker "Grey Company of Free Knights". Called such because of the grey cloaks and dour disposition that appear to be their defining characteristic, plenty mock them behind their backs because of their rather dishevelled state. Conflicts have been a feature of Griffonia for quite some time now, yet as nation-states are reorganising their forces from feudal levies to professional soldiers, few have need for unreliable mercenaries.\nThe leader of these forces, Mercenary Leader Name Here, has properly recognised that the Verenian strife might be their last opportunity to earn a respectable amount. He has graciously offered his services, with plenty of flattery, leaving the Ducal Court to decide on what to do with them.\n\n"Monsieur le Duc d'Erie", began paladin d'Étang, "I must firmly disagree with the notion that House Erie needs the assistance of these lowlifes. We are all aware of the chronic shortage of griffonpower, but how can we trust them to behave, to follow our lead? What little I've heard of this 'Grey Company' has been rather negative." His knightly comrades nodded in approval, believing this to be sufficient reasoning.\n\n"Have all of your brains turned to rot?" Spymaster Livio was never one to withhold a strong opinion, which earned him much jeers and shaking fists in his direction, particularly from Cyrille. "Silence your beaks and allow me to speak. My Duke, what d'Étang has said is mostly true. However, can we really afford to be picky about the help we can get? Shall we throw away everything we've done so far, just to satisfy a vague notion of 'honour'?"

A whole perfectly good factory burned down, countless griffs killed, not to mention the other property damage! All that over a simple misunderstanding over the new conscription regulations. Fixing that had to be the first priority, as the Vicomte de Perdrix rose up.\n\n"Monsieur de Erie, the recent events were regrettable, but it was hardly a disaster. That district was underperforming for years, and honestly it was less expensive to tear it down than modernise it. The plan we came up with should solve the problem, as well as bolstering our assets for the future. But we will have to invest in better policing measures."\n\nThe Duke was happy with the proposal. The restoration of production, putting the peasants in their place, those were all excellent measures, but his scheming was interrupted by the "perfect" paladin in shining armour. "Mon Duc, I urge you to consider the following. I do not condone violence or insurrection, but we cannot push our servants too far. Show them some eleos, and we'll have a grateful populace that will support our goals."\n\nMust Cyrille always bother with this pious nonsense?

Why don't we make their lives a little easier, build a few new houses, offer charity and such? Surely, Eyr would look fondly on those who uphold Her virtues." Vincent only paid half the attention to his sibling as he did to the thoughts of a new marble sculpture of himself, as the Vicomte de Perdrix raised dissent.\n\n"Monsieur de Erie, myself and my peers believe that we should invest further in our industrial capacity. More factories, more production, better for us all. It shall repay us in dividends once Verenia is ours, and I suppose the peasants will benefit from it, somehow. They should be happy we're paying them at all, bah."\n\nAnother difficult choice for Vincent, it seemed.

Ordnance is powerful, but it has a range limit, and so do the planes we've fortunately acquired from our Aquileian friends. These rockets, as I've come to call them, represent the next stage of warfare, as we leave behind the brave warrior risking his life in combat. Quite passé, if you ask me.

I've found the most difficult challenge to be ensuring that the guidance system is precise..."\n\nFabrice was brilliant, but perhaps a bit too much, because Vincent stopped paying attention to his rambling. Rather, he focused on what he understood - devastating assault making short work of the notoriously entrenched riverbank. The paladins would simply cross over, hack away at any unfortunate enough to survive the attack, and victory would be his! Oh, glorious day! The grand inventor was worth every idol.

Not even a dent, as it shined brightly, reflecting the inventory's smug visage.\n\n"H-how? Fabrice, did you invent invincibility?" Griffon armour was known to be durable, but this was something else entirely. "Can we just walk to Calembourg, clad in this? Is this some pony magic?"\n\n"Ponies? Bah, how could they measure up to the ingenuity of griffonkind? I merely worked with our artificers and figured out an appropriate alloy, with a new enchantment that shrugs off everything... To a certain size. The enchantment wears off quickly, but I've secured enough material to make it last for the crucial moment.

We can attribute many reasons to past failures, but plenty of times did they fail to cover the assault. Now, no sense crying over spilled wine, but I've decided the best course of action is to correct this problem. Later on, after we seize victory, we can train the griffs properly."\n\n"But where will this cannon be mounted upon? I don't think any chassis we have could support it."\n\n"I thought about using some of those tanks we acquired from our Aquileian friends, but those frames were simply too fragile to carry it. No, it will be placed upon a modified train, upon which it will easily follow the troops as they progress forward. I have already gathered the best griffs for the task of firing, reloading and maintaining, while while myself will personally ensure its accuracy.

He should be serving at the court of the Herzland Emperor, or at least a King of Aquileia! If they would hire him, anyway, Fabrice was not always the most servile underling.\n\nBut there had to be a way of making sure everygriff saw his genius. Something that would enshrine his name in the history books for an eternity, even past the rule of the pony princesses across the ocean. The idea came to him in a flash when he saw what his claws held."

Everything will be as I said."\n\n"Comte d'Pont-aux-Griffes." Cyrille would sneer at the technically correct, yet inappropriate method of address. Surely, his brave achievements were worth more than a plot of land? "Are the paladins ready to lead the Erian regiments and companies?"\n"We are prepared to march in accordance to the plan, Monsieur le Duc. We've done everything we could to ensure success."\n\n"Maître-Espion Ducal Sillègue." Livio would discreetly roll his eyes, feeling snubbed yet again. Was he not worth to be addressed by name? Nor did he appreciate the irony of being put in the same basket as the tinpot paladin. "Has the latest information on enemy troop numbers and concentration been verified as correct?"\n"It is factual, your lordship. Additionally, I've managed to cause some trouble behind the frontline. Not much, but it can only help."\n\n\n"Nothing more needs to be said. We have been humbled plentifully, yet it will be us now rising in triumph. For victory, for Verenia.""

Guillaume shouldn't have taken up that suspicious recruiter's offer, but the pay was good and it looked like an escape from the Penose. Currently, that was a very small comfort, as he received orders two days ago about mobilisation, and now he was crouching in a trench. Maybe he should have also considered, that war would eventually return here, despite the frequent jokes about the two bickering Dukes.\n\nGuillaume and his company thus remained in their position, waiting for... something to occur, as bullets and shells flew above them. That paladin captain was not entirely specific about "what" that something was, only that it couldn't be missed even if you were a blind and deaf griff. It better be good, he was looking forward to retire with all of his limbs and feathers intact.\n\nTime seemingly passed at a crawl in this smoke covered battlefield, and no relief seemed to have been on the way. Guillaume seriously considered if he should just sink into the ground and attempt to hide entirely from this living Tartarus, until a strange whistling noise was heard. What was that? He didn't see any ponies around here, griffs can't whistle.\n\nThe answer was soon revealed, for he would see large cylindrical objects crossing the sky in speeds he couldn't achieve even in his better days, impacting with a large explosion at the fortified positions on the other side of the river. That dreadful noise would haunt him in his sleep for days to come, as everything became eerily quiet. That is, until the commanding officer ordered a charge."

They shrugged off anything thrown at them, and Guillaume was left with his beak hanging open. How, just how? Invincibility was only a myth from Equestrian tales! His confusion would be put to the side as the commanding officer ordered a charge, a rousing battlecry heard from all behind."

As the dust and debris settled, he would carefully look up, cautious of any more of that Maar's infernal noise. Smoke was rising from across the river, from one of the largest craters he had ever seen. It wasn't long until the commanding officer ordered a charge."

erie_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The so-called Verenian Struggle has outlasted many conflicts that arose from the Republican Revolution of 978. Even as neighbouring regions settled into a pretence of peace, the infamously stubborn heirs of the late Verenian Duke refused to lay down their weapons as battles and ceasefires followed one after another. Thus, the proudly independent region has only known strife for decades.\n\nYet to the surprise of many, the cycle of familial bloodshed has ended on this day. Despite the lack of foreign support, and dwindling resources, [ERI.GetLeader] has emerged victorious over his rivals and declared himself the undisputed ruler of Verenia. As the weary populace hopes to rebuild, the newly minted Grand Duke looks beyond his borders to secure himself a lasting reign."

FIR_shinespark_cw.1.t:0 "Impulse Decisions Etched Into Stone"
FIR_shinespark_cw.1.d:0 "Shinespark paced in the hut her father had once used as his office. Or rather, whatever passed as an office in the Firtrees. In the middle of the room stood Starheart, watching her old friend walk circle around her. "Sparky, I've been thinking..." she said. "You know everything about the outside world... Surely they have better weapons than what us, right?"\n\nShinespark furrowed her brow, opening and closing her mouth several times. "I mean— I—" She took a deep breath. "Yes, ponies—and griffons for that matter—out there have firearms—long tubes that shoot projectiles fast enough to pierce hide—but they're not exactly easy to produce." Despite her best efforts, her words almost blended together as they flooded out of her muzzle. Thankfully, that didn't stop Starheart from understanding her, though she kept an expectant gaze on Shinespark. "Look, we don't have the time to set up a production line for them, even if I was somehow an expert on them. And I'm not! I know nothing about them! I could maybe tell you how to make black powder, but I think even that's obsolete now!" Then again, they would still beat spears and swords... If she knew how to make them!\n\n"Well, it was just one idea. You know so much now, so there's got to be something that can help us."\n\n"There isn't! I never bothered learning anything like that! I need a real plan, not something that relies on me... knowing things I don't! I just—"\n\n"Miss Shinespark?" came a voice from outside. A moment later, a large scar-covered unicorn mare walked into the hut. "We finished tallying up our warriors. I know I wanted to create small units to flank our enemies in the hills... but in hindsight I think it may be better to group them by region instead, since they know each other already, and know how to work together."\n\nShinespark, resisting the urge to say, "I told you so," nodded. "I... All right, if you think that's for the best."\n\n"One more thing, Chieftain... Were you talking to yourself?"\n\n"No she wasn't!" Starheart practically shouted right into Oakenfavour's ear.\n\nShinespark, meanwhile, let out a nervous laugh. "Oh, haha, yes I was. It sometimes, uh, helps me keep my head clear to say things out loud. My colleagues at university used to hate me for that, haha.""

FIR_init.1.t:0 "" # TODO: WIP
FIR_init.1.d:0 "<name1> cleared his throat, silencing the whispered chit-chat of the assembled council before him. "I'm sure most of you know why the emergency assembly was called." Of the thirteen other earth ponies sitting at the table, many nodded, some wearing satisfied smirks, while two rolled their eyes. "I see you, <name2> and <name3>. I understand you consider Shinespark's influence negligible, but you are full in a room of ponies who have reason to believe otherwise."\n\n"Please," said <name2>, "she was exiled over twenty five years ago. Even if she could somehow gather a nontrivial following, her return remains unlawful, and all we have to do is expel her."<name4> cleared his throat. \n\n"I understand that the public opinion isn't quite the same in <furthest province> as here, but you well and truly underestimate the sway her father held over the modernist movement. And may I remind you he pardoned her in his will, and explicitly named her as his successor? Any attempt to remove her will be met with harsh resistance from the modernists." <name2> opened her mouth, but was immediately cut off. "They are already on edge, because practically nopony believes that <father's name>'s death was accidental. So that particular trick will certainly not work again."\n\n<name2> scoffed. "Chief <name4>! What are you insinuating?!"\n\nBefore <name4> could reply, Goldenmane spoke up. "I am certain she is accusing nopony in particular, as whether or not <father's name>'s death was accidental is irrelevant. Either way, the public considers it too convenient, and harbours heavy suspicion of the council."\n\n"And even if that's true, what following does she have? If half a dozen idiots want to oppose the decision to get rid of such an obvious trouble maker, they will hardly be missed, though I understand if your bleeding heart goes out to them. At your age I would have done the same." She snickered at her own comment, it was met with a few glares.\n\n"And that's where you are wrong as well," said <name1>. The past few days have revealed she has somehow earned the Golden Horns' support."\n\nA dead silence blanketed the room for several long moments."

FIR_init.2.t:0 "Shinespark Introduces Herself" # TODO: edit
FIR_init.2.d:0 "Shinespark gulped, shook her head, and took the first step onto the dais built between two massive trees. Holding a speech in what, to her, amounted to the heart of a forest would be a first. She only took a proper look at the crowd in front of her after placing her notes on the lectern, and her jaw nearly fell to the ground. How many ponies stood there, waiting for her? Two hundred? A thousand? Definitely too many to estimate at a glance.\n\n"Wow. That's a bigger crowd than I expected." She let out a nervous chuckle. "Look at me, going off-script the moment I step on stage. Anyway, good afternoon everypony. My name is Shinespark, and I recently returned from exile at my father's death wish. My main and only goal is to help my homeland overcome its current crisis, to prepare it against foreign invasions, and to it lead onto a modern path."\n\nShe stayed silent for a moment, allowing her audience to take in her words. "Many of you know this already, of course, else you wouldn't be here, but I wanted to state my intent clearly. I do not want to divide you, and I certainly do not want to impose my vision. I promised my father I would help him in any way I could, and after his untimely demise—"\n\n"You mean his murder!" someone in the crowd shouted, followed by several shouts of agreement.\n\nShinespark's polite smile fell into a frown. "No, I do not mean his murder. That conclusion is far too rash and counterproductive. Until proof of the contrary, we must assume his death was of natural causes." She sighed again, and forced herself to continue. "Now where was I... Right. I'll make this short, as I've said most of what I wanted to say. I don't quite know how this campaign of mine will play out, but I look forward to your support, and I hope that, together, we can somehow find our way out of this hole. Thank you for your time." As the crowd's applause rang out in the town's plaza, Shinespark gave a curt bow and disappeared behind the stage, and let out a long sigh."
FIR_init.2.a:0 "That had gone nearly perfectly according to the plan."

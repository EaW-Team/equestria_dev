FIR_shinespark_cw.1.d:0 "Shinespark paced in the hut her father had once used as his office. Or rather, whatever passed as an office in the Firtrees. In the middle of the room stood Starheart, watching her old friend walk circle around her. "Sparky, I've been thinking..." she said. "You know everything about the outside world... Surely they have better weapons than what us, right?"\n\nShinespark furrowed her brow, opening and closing her mouth several times. "I mean— I—" She took a deep breath. "Yes, ponies—and griffons for that matter—out there have firearms—long tubes that shoot projectiles fast enough to pierce hide—but they're not exactly easy to produce." Despite her best efforts, her words almost blended together as they flooded out of her muzzle. Thankfully, that didn't stop Starheart from understanding her, though she kept an expectant gaze on Shinespark. "Look, we don't have the time to set up a production line for them, even if I was somehow an expert on them. And I'm not! I know nothing about them! I could maybe tell you how to make black powder, but I think even that's obsolete now!" Then again, they would still beat spears and swords... If she knew how to make them!\n\n"Well, it was just one idea. You know so much now, so there's got to be something that can help us."\n\n"There isn't! I never bothered learning anything like that! I need a real plan, not something that relies on me... knowing things I don't! I just—"\n\n"Miss Shinespark?" came a voice from outside. A moment later, a large scar-covered unicorn mare walked into the hut. "We finished tallying up our warriors. I know I wanted to create small units to flank our enemies in the hills... but in hindsight I think it may be better to group them by region instead, since they know each other already, and know how to work together."\n\nShinespark, resisting the urge to say, "I told you so," nodded. "I... All right, if you think that's for the best."\n\n"One more thing, Chieftain... Were you talking to yourself?"\n\n"No she wasn't!" Starheart practically shouted right into Oakenfavour's ear.\n\nShinespark, meanwhile, let out a nervous laugh. "Oh, haha, yes I was. It sometimes, uh, helps me keep my head clear to say things out loud. My colleagues at university used to hate me for that, haha.""

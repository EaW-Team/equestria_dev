ZES_council_convenes:0 "The Advisory Council's Final Session"
ZES_council_convenes_desc:0 "As our nation prepares for elections to the Kásan Advisory Council, the council has gathered one last time to sort out its closing business.

ZES_livru_programa:0 "Livru Programa"
ZES_livru_programa_desc:0 "One of the foremost goals that our nation has been working towards for many years now is the issue of illiteracy. This has been one of the initiatives championed by Mansu Erba, and so the First Commander has promising results to deliver to the council."

ZES_xatisa_relief:0 "Xatisa Relief"
ZES_xatisa_relief_desc:0 "While we would love it if this meeting could be only sunshine and good feelings, it is time to discuss the dragon in the room. Our nation possesses a serious issue in the form of Barrad refugees. A report on the situation is due from First Commander."

ZES_prudutu_projektu:0 "Prudutu Projektu"
ZES_prudutu_projektu_desc:0 "While many upon this continent would call us backward and primitive, we have made steps forward in the modernization of our nation. The First Commander and Councilor Pasarinha will address the council on this subject."

ZES_friend_macawia:0 "Our Dearest Macawia"
ZES_friend_macawia_desc:0 "The nation of Macawia holds a dear place in the hearts of all in Kása, and our connection to them is the strongest we have with any foreign power. The ambassador to Macawia is due to give his remarks to the Kásan."

ZES_dread_neighbours:0 "Our Dreaded Neighbours"
ZES_dread_neighbours_desc:0 "We are surrounded on all sides by regimes that may wish to see us wiped out. The dangerous Barrad, the unpredictable Austurland, and threatening Gryphus; add onto this that the River Federation sees our lands as a possible threat to their union. The first commander shall speak on this to steady the hearts of the people."

ZES_council_disbands:0 "First Commander's Closing Statement"
ZES_council_disbands_desc:0 "As the council stacks their papers and prepares to return to their election preparations, all of the councilors await the closing remarks of their First Commander. She has led them through much, and they cling to every word.\n\nSo let us see what she has to say."

ZES_election:0 "Elição"
ZES_election_desc:0 "The time for elections has finally come, and it seems they will be more impactful than anycreature thought possible. All the citizens of Kása shall go to their town or village center, and vote for the fate of their nation."

ZES_expand_literacy_campaign:0 "Expand Literacy Campaign"
ZES_expand_literacy_campaign_desc:0 "Knowledge can free you. Knowledge that resistance was possible led to our predecessors rising up. Knowledge of its existence led to thousands risking everything in the hunt for freedom. Yet the world demands more than these things, and if Kása is to remain the shining beacon of freedom she always were, then her people must be educated."

ZES_soup_kitchens:0 "Warm Soup For the Hungry"
ZES_soup_kitchens_desc:0 "The steady influx of refugees from the north is not just a matter of suffering and pain, but of poor organization too. We offer aid to those who come here, but it is disjointed, disorganized and inefficient. A desperate refugee starving because of poor organization is a betrayal of what Kása is. For all those who come here, yearning to breathe free, we have to do better."

ZES_formalize_book_drives:0 "Formalizar as Doações di Livros"
ZES_formalize_book_drives_desc:0 "The charity of countless Kásans have helped us hugely in the battle against illiteracy, yet charity unsupported by structures and oversight is inefficient and wasteful. There should be no hesitation for anycreature about where to go, nor what books are needed, and every last book donated should be put to good use."

ZES_call_upon_expats:0 "Call Upon the Expats"
ZES_call_upon_expats_desc:0 ""...and though you all now reside beyond the borders of Kása, where I hope that life treats you well, I nevertheless wish to ask for your help. Whether by your return, or by your expertise Kása would greatly benefit from your contributions. We are all Kása, and we can all elevate her."\n-First Commander Lûa Ramedi"    

ZES_implore_nation:0 "Implore Kása"
ZES_implore_nation_desc:0 "As we did during the Battle of Ebyron, we must rally as a nation to address the Xatisa. The average citizen must be implored to help house the refugees, to open their larders to help feed them and to watch the paths out of Barrad to aid those in need. Only together can we truly address this crisis."

ZES_wagon_schools:0 "Escolas Móveis"
ZES_wagon_schools_desc:0 "So many of our people live beyond the cities and towns, and we do not have teachers or schools enough to cover every last village. Instead of ignoring them, we should formalize a program of mobile schools, which can cover greater areas and let the little ones be taught closer to home."

ZES_ink_and_bread:0 "Tinta e Padrão"
ZES_ink_and_bread_desc:0 "Nourishment is everything for a student to learn well, and proper educational tools is as essential to truly prosper. The apex of Lûa Ramedi's great literacy campaign will set in stone the rights of all Kásans to both these things. There can be no excuses for failure. Our people will be fed and educated, period."

ZES_meet_with_yrmthu:0 "Meet With Yrmthu"
ZES_meet_with_yrmthu_desc:0 "If there is anyone who embodies Kása it is Yrmthu, a once starving refugee who now has risen to become one of Kása's greatest leaders. Her zealous dedication to the people is admirable, and if she would be willing to take a place in our cabinet she would be a great asset."

ZES_meet_with_pasarinha:0 "Meet With Pasarinha"
ZES_meet_with_pasarinha_desc:0 "The modern world waits for no one, and Pasarinha is just the kind of asset we need to make sure Kása can face down the challenges of the modern era. In an age of industry, we must be able to think big, and he can help us with this."

ZES_instill_trust:0 "Instill Trust"
ZES_instill_trust_desc:0 "Lûa Ramedi is many things, but a firebrand speaker is not one of them. His skill has always been more in the administrative and the organizational field, and to instill confidence in the people, he has chosen to simply get to work, decisively moving to address many issues that have piled up in recent years. Bureaucracy and maintenance isn't attractive, but it is necessary."

ZES_intellectual_advisors:0 "Intellectual Advisors"
ZES_intellectual_advisors_desc:0 "Different times call for different skill-sets. Gone is the day where brave fighters or canny smugglers were what Kása needed. Now it needs engineers, scientists and scholars. Thankfully, Lûa Ramedi has taken careful notes during his many years of service, and he knows just the kind of creatures to call upon."

ZES_economic_advisors:0 "Economic Advisors"
ZES_economic_advisors_desc:0 "A strong Kása must have a strong economy. A strong economy will give the people jobs, it will allow us to field a stronger army and it will allow us to master our own fates. This will not happen on its own though, and we must make sure to listen carefully to those who know how to navigate these particular waters."

ZES_shared_responsibility:0 "Equilíbrio di Poder"
ZES_shared_responsibility_desc:0 "As Kása advances, new powers emerge within her, powers that could change her for the worse. These challenges aren't overcome by heroic last stands or personal risk, but by a strong yet rule-bound apparatus of state, in which the average civil servant feels a stake in doing things the right way."

ZES_continue_projektu:0 "Continue Projektu"
ZES_continue_projektu_desc:0 "The Prudutu Projektu is one of Mansu Erba's great accomplishments, and though it is tempting to expand and accelerate it, the steady progress that has been made is not to be scoffed at. To gamble with the progress made would be irresponsible, and it is better to make good use of the progress being made."

ZES_implore_affluent:0 "Appeal To the Affluents"
ZES_implore_affluent_desc:0 "There are many in Kása who have managed to build a great life for themselves, and though we would not dream to begrudge them their success, it is hard to avoid the fact that when you have a lot, you would rather keep it. Convincing the wealthy to help out is different from convincing the poor, yet it can still be done."

ZES_bridges_and_roads:0 "Pontes Sobre Ilhas"
ZES_bridges_and_roads_desc:0 "A bridge is a strong symbol for unity and progress both. It lets even the poorest cross on the same terms as the richest, it allows for the flow of commerce and industry and it opens up formerly isolated regions to the rest of the nation."

ZES_invest_local_civilian:0 "Support Local Companies"
ZES_invest_local_civilian_desc:0 "Kása shall stand on its own four hooves, that has never been up for debate. Those zebras and ponies who toil away in their workshops and stores could become so much more, if we only make sure to give them a helping hoof."

ZES_hire_refugees:0 "Employment Opportunities Act"
ZES_hire_refugees_desc:0 "Our people need jobs, but one cannot simply jump into a job cannon to be fired off into job land where jobs grow on jobbies. A more sober view of the situation acknowledges that some need only to be put in contact with prospective employers, but some need training, some need guidance, and all need actual opportunities."

ZES_open_our_ports:0 "Abri Nossas Portus"
ZES_open_our_ports_desc:0 "Kása is not an island unto herself, and her limited resources mean that she needs to embrace the world in order to prosper. We have the location for it, and if we make sure to embrace our naval heritage, we can build ourselves into a naval power both economically and militarily."

ZES_projektu_tera:0 "Projektu Tera"
ZES_projektu_tera_desc:0 "Much of Kasa is still untamed wilderness and underdeveloped countryside where little has been accomplished. This, too, shall change though. With the Kásan economy invigorated, we have the resources and the expertise to begin the first ever development project not of Seguro, or Ilha Rosca, but of all Kása."

ZES_deal_with_jarl:0 "Lidar Com Austurland"
ZES_deal_with_jarl_desc:0 "The deer to the east have been a concern for Kása for as long as we can remember. At times there has been peace, yet at times their raiders have savaged our lands. Until now we have not been in a position to deal with the matter for good, yet between our rapid growth in recent years as well as the changes in Austurland, the time has finally come to address the issue on a more permanent basis."

ZES_free_minds_and_hearts:0 "Free Minds and Hearts"
ZES_free_minds_and_hearts_desc:0 "One of the key freedoms of all creatures is the freedom of opportunity, and in order to have the most opportunities in the modern world, knowledge is essential. We must learn, we must understand, and we must grow. This is the duty of all free creatures, and we shall not waver."

ZES_monument:0 "Monument of the Downtrodden"
ZES_monument_desc:0 "Kása has many reasons to be proud of its accomplishments, and its defenders should be honored. Yet, it would be easy to throw up a tacky statue to honor and service and courage. Too easy, in fact. War is not like that, and it would be wrong to whitewash it."

ZES_remember_past:0 "Remember the Past..."
ZES_remember_past_desc:0 "Our nation was founded by desperate refugees on an alien shore, who transformed their situation from desperation to prosperity. We owe all to those who came before us, and we will always remember them."

ZES_for_future:0 "...For the Sake of the Future"
ZES_for_future_desc:0 "One day, our descendants will look back on what we accomplished, and their judgement will fall on us, as it falls on everycreature. If war comes to our lands, it is on all Kásans to remember what they are defending; the liberty and security of countless generations yet unborn."

ZES_educate_all:0 "Edukason Universal"
ZES_educate_all_desc:0 "If our nation shall advance, we must make sure even the least among us are given the skills and the education needed for the modern world. No matter where they live, no matter their background, and no matter their character, we must give them all proper education."

ZES_teach_democracy:0 "Democratic Values"
ZES_teach_democracy_desc:0 "Though Kása's doors stand open for all, this should not be confused for blind tolerance for every idea out there. It might be paradoxical, but in order for democracy to prosper, it must justify and educate the people about its existence and its demands, otherwise we give tyrants an open gate to use democracy to abolish it."

ZES_mandatory_and_free:0 "Supplementary Schools"
ZES_mandatory_and_free_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, there are those who do not fit into the education system. Thankfully, Yrmthu has proposed a solution for how to address this. Instead of beating them down and leaving them feeling worthless, we will create a system of supplementary schools with looser reins, where those who failed once can get a new chance on their own terms."

ZES_students_abroad:0 "Student Exchange Program"
ZES_students_abroad_desc:0 "As our education system grows, it is attracting more attention from abroad. Ambitious scientists and professors across Kása has already forged bonds with academies beyond our shores, and there are many who would accept our sons and daughters as students."

ZES_formal_education:0 "Enshrine Formal Education"
ZES_formal_education_desc:0 "Knowledge is power, and we are steadily working towards making Kása a scientific great power. In due time, Seguro can become an academic institution much like Yale, but in order for this to happen, we must be ready to dedicate ourselves to this pursuit."

ZES_build_faculty:0 "Build Modern Faculties"
ZES_build_faculty_desc:0 "Scientific progress is no longer a matter of singular geniuses, but an industrial effort that requires specialized tools, and we're not going to let our finest minds struggle without proper equipment."

ZES_latest_curriculum:0 "Currículo Mais Risentimenti"
ZES_latest_curriculum_desc:0 "Once, certain crafts were vital for Kása, but time has marched on and we must reevaluate what our students are taught. In the classroom, the children are prepared for modern society, and things like wickercrafting is not nearly as useful as it once was."

ZES_unified_spirit:0 "Espírito Unificado"
ZES_unified_spirit_desc:0 "From pre-schools to the highest universities, our education system is one entity. It is the first gentle hoof that molds our citizens to be able to thrive, and no matter where they are, there is a way forward for them."

ZES_practical_education:0 "Assess Practical Education"
ZES_practical_education_desc:0 "It is true that academic education is vital, but so is the more hooves-on type of knowledge. We shouldn't forget the value of the practical alongside the theoretical. A master engineer holds value equal to a genius professor, and the education should be held in equal regard. "

ZES_apprenticeship_program:0 "Apprenticeship Program"
ZES_apprenticeship_program_desc:0 "Most crafts are not learned in the school bench, but in the workshop and on the factory floor. For all those practically minded foals and chicks who languish in the classroom, there should be an easy and established way to let them come into their own right."

ZES_cooperate_with_business:0 "Kordena Com Nogosi"
ZES_cooperate_with_business_desc:0 "The private sector of Kása holds countless talented innovators and businesscreatures, and their experiences can help shaping our apprentices. This, in turn, will let the private sector benefit all of Kása more indirectly as well."

ZES_entrepreneurial_spirit:0 "Espírito Empreendedor"
ZES_entrepreneurial_spirit_desc:0 "We are not merely educating scientists, but ambitious entrepreneurs as well. The ivory tower intellectual has his place, but the innovator takes society forwards just as much."

ZES_shining_pearl:0 "The Shining Pearl"
ZES_shining_pearl_desc:0 "On the shores of southern Griffonia, Kása stands as a beacon of hope and prosperity for all, a place where none is left without a chance to fulfil their full potential. Since the days of Akeeku, we have known that prosperity is measured as how the weakest among us are doing, and in this regard, we have delivered!"

ZES_freedom_of_press:0 "Cherish the Free Press"
ZES_freedom_of_press_desc:0 "We will never allow ourselves to become so high and mighty that we cannot tolerate criticism. If the free media wishes to protest against the actions we take, that is their prerogative. Ours will be to listen."

ZES_discredit_tyranny:0 "Discredit Tyrannical Ideals"
ZES_discredit_tyranny_desc:0 "Democracy is not - must not - be two wolves and a sheep voting on who is for dinner, nor should it meekly accept challenges to its core values. Those who seek to undermine our democracy will be challenged to prove their reasoning, and through the virtue of Kása's achievements they will be found wanting."

ZES_codify_institutions:0 "Codifying our Institutions"
ZES_codify_institutions_desc:0 "Having tasted the power available to the First Commander, Lûa Ramedi finds himself hesitating. The power at his command is immense, and it will only grow. Though he would not presume to judge those who served before him, he simply cannot let virtue alone be what restrains him. Laws help society hold itself to a higher standard, and he should not be exempt."

ZES_mansuism:0 "Mansuism"
ZES_mansuism_desc:0 "Kása's Advisory Council is a fine institution, one that supposedly has the power to depose even the First Commander. It is time to do away with the gray areas and let it take up the burden of leadership. Lûa Ramedi is content to sit in it as first among equals, and the immense powers he hold can go back where it belongs: to the people."

ZES_welfare_to_poor:0 "Establish Welfare System"
ZES_welfare_to_poor_desc:0 "Kásans have always taken care of each other, and our government should be no different. Schooling, unemployment, old age, all these things can cause problems for the unfortunate, and we did not build Kása to these heights just to people can be left at the fickle whims of fortune."

ZES_open_doors:0 "Into Kása's embrace"
ZES_open_doors_desc:0 "Ho there wanderer, from distant shores/Whose journey brings you to our gate/We beg you, sit, we'll tend your sores/If you would tell us of your fate\nThe path behind you grows dark still/From whence you were forced to roam/But you can rest now, if you will/Come, let Kása be your new home."

ZES_bakaran_way:0 "The Bakaran Way"
ZES_bakaran_way_desc:0 "To our north, Bakara has a longstanding tradition of local democracy, and while recent events there have given reason to be mindful of the kinks in the system, the value of keeping democracy close to the constituents cannot be overstated."

ZES_define_democratic_process:0 "The Due Process of the Law"
ZES_define_democratic_process_desc:0 "Democratic Kása is a frail idea, and it needs to be firmly established by law and by culture both. This is not a temporary measure, nor is it at the First Commander's sufferance only. It shall stand strong and vibrant, unshaken by winds of populism or incompetence."

ZES_skapatoria_purpose:0 "Agents of Freedom"
ZES_skapatoria_purpose_desc:0 "The Skapatoria Programa is one of Kása's greatest assets, and its services will not be less vital in the future.

ZES_embassies:0 "Our Place in the World"
ZES_embassies_desc:0 "Kása is a small nation in a big world, and our best bet for survival is to rely on more than our army and our people, but on our friends as well. We are not alone in our desire for peace and harmony, and we should endeavor to find like-minded regimes out there."

ZES_republican_thought:0 "Philosophy of the Tricolour"
ZES_republican_thought_desc:0 "The issues facing Kása is not unique, and other species have found their own answers. The ideals of Alexander Kemerskai and the Griffonian republicans offer a solution to Lûa Ramedi's woes. Kása's First Commander and the Griffonian President are, in the end, similar institutions, and the First Commander should be bound like the president is meant to be."

ZES_protect_liberty:0 "In Defence of Liberty"
ZES_protect_liberty_desc:0 "Kása's army is not an instrument of suppression, but a tool of liberty. They fight to defend their fellow creatures, no matter what challenges arise, and internal threats are no different. If, the gods forbid, the institutions of law and order fail, the military has a sacred duty. If need be, they must step in to defend not power-hungry politicians, but the values of the nation."

ZES_prosperous_democracy:0 "Equal Prosperity"
ZES_prosperous_democracy_desc:0 "When a society is divided it becomes weakened. With the wealth that now is at Kása's disposal, it will behoove us to make sure that everyone can benefit from it. Whether born in a hovel or in a palace, all creatures should share what Kása has."

ZES_asterion_model:0 "Asterion Model"
ZES_asterion_model_desc:0 "Freedom isn't free, and the price can too often be paid in blood. Thus it was paid on the D'Vash, and thus it was paid by the Minotaurs of Asterion. We can learn from them, and make sure that we have the tools to safeguard our democracy by whatever means necessary."

ZES_council_republic:0 "Devolved Rule"
ZES_council_republic_desc:0 "The change has been monumental, but it was necessary. Lûa Ramedi held absolute power and his hooves, and he has let it go, giving it to the people who he holds responsibility for. They will be given the highest responsibility and become masters of their own fate."

ZES_presidential_republic:0 "Presidential Executive"
ZES_presidential_republic_desc:0 "The role of the president is to act as a leader in times or war and peace both, yet he holds this power in trust, and he rules as a symbol of unity and mutual respect. If he fails in his duty, he can and should be deposed. His role is clearly defined, leaving nothing to chance or interpretation, and in this clarity there is trust."

ZES_declare_republic:0 "Declarar a República"
ZES_declare_republic_desc:0 "Kása will never be the same again, and time will pass its judgement as it does with all things, yet Lûa Ramedi knows that this was the right thing to do. Kása's people deserve a voice, and Kása will be stronger for it. "

ZES_look_for_friends:0 "Look For Friends"
ZES_look_for_friends_desc:0 "The fact is that Kása is small and surrounded by large powers. Yet, we still have friends out there, friends who have known the pain of bondage and who would stand with us, if we made sure to play our cards right."

ZES_macawian_cooperation:0 "Old Friendship"
ZES_macawian_cooperation_desc:0 "Macawia is and will always remain Kása's dear friend. This bond shall not be broken easily, and as a show of good faith, Lûa Ramedi has negotiated for a grand military exercise, under which Macawia will act as the enemy, attempting to invade Kása. It is merely an exercise, but nevertheless Kása has grown enough that it can now stand firm even against its old patron."

ZES_liberation_ships:0 "Navios di Libertação"
ZES_liberation_ships_desc:0 "The seas are our domain as much as the land, and we shall contest it just as fiercely. The seas were where we gained our freedom, and if slavers, raiders or conquerors dare to approach our shores, they shall find the Kásan navy waiting for them. "

ZES_secured_foreign_policy:0 "Watch Out For Foes"
ZES_secured_foreign_policy_desc:0 "Tolerance is not naiveté, nor is a desire for peace mere weakness. Kása was born through fighting, and if need be she will do it again. She can defend herself, she wants to defend herself and she will defend herself." 

ZES_secure_borders:0 "Fronteiras Seguras"
ZES_secure_borders_desc:0 "From the very second that an invader sets hoof on our lands, he shall run headlong into our defenses, and not a single inch of Kása shall be surrendered to him without bitter fighting. We are not a superpower, but we can make the enemy spill enough blood that if we finally, the cost was not worth the prize."

ZES_defend_harmony:0 "For the Republic!"
ZES_defend_harmony_desc:0 "If war should come, it is every citizen's duty to defend the nation with every mean available. Every message saying that resistance should cease is a false one, and the only way that peace can be achieved is when the invaders are driven out."

ZES_foundations_of_modern_kasa:0 "Foundations of Modern Kása"
ZES_foundations_of_modern_kasa_desc:0 "From shacks huddling together on a stormy shore, to fledgling towns and villages, to a prosperous nation. Kása is rising, and the fruits of all our labours are growing each day. Yet as we harvest, the question is how we make the most of our blessings."

ZES_public_radio:0 "Radio Kása"
ZES_public_radio_desc:0 "Inspired by the recent development in telecommunications, Radio Kása can finally begin broadcasting. With radio masts set up across the nation, and with three dedicated channels - News, Music and Education respectively - the entire nation will be able to enjoy this newest of media."

ZES_continue_public_projects:0 "Continue Public Projects"
ZES_continue_public_projects_desc:0 "We have made splendid progress in these last years, and the Xatisa crisis is slowly approaching its end.

ZES_guarantee_employment:0 "Guarantee Employment"
ZES_guarantee_employment_desc:0 "Our successes are leading to new questions, not the least the one regarding what to make of the refugees long term. Adapting to a new society is tricky, and we will have to make sure that they - as well as those who already were here - have a genuine chance as long as they genuinely wish to work. It will cost, but our society will be stronger for it."

ZES_ministry_of_finance:0 "Ministério das Finanças"
ZES_ministry_of_finance_desc:0 "Macawia's financial aid has been invaluable, but the time has come for Kása to stand on its own four hooves. With greater control of our economy, we will be able to more effectively control our own fate."

ZES_international_port:0 "Expandir Portu di Ilha Rosca"
ZES_international_port_desc:0 "The success of the Ilha Rosca ports speaks for itself, but all projections suggest that they are over capacity. It is overall a pretty nice problem to have, or at least one that can be addressed with some effort."

ZES_fund_development:0 "Renewing Seguro"
ZES_fund_development_desc:0 "Seguro is one of the older cities in Kása, and time has caught up with it. With the recent progress made elsewhere, the time has come to truly regenerate the city. Voices have been raised about the preservation of some of the older buildings, and we shouldn't be hasty, but at the same time old thatched roof huts aren't quaint enough to outweigh proper new housing."

ZES_invite_the_world:0 "Invite the World To Us"
ZES_invite_the_world_desc:0 "Kása is not and should not be an isolationist state. The world is out there, and instead of casting it out, viewing it as morally inferior, we should embrace it. We will have to prevent certain excesses, true, but if foreign companies can behave, they can make us both prosper."

ZES_develope_outback:0 "All of Kása Should Live"
ZES_develope_outback_desc:0 "The cities of Kása will most likely prosper on their own, and that is not where our efforts should be spent. The nature of our economic system means some regions get left behind. We mustn't let that happen, and therefore we must actively work to make sure all of Kása can prosper." 

ZES_gift_land_act:0 "Ato di Propriedadi"
ZES_gift_land_act_desc:0 "Land ownership in Kása is highly unequal, with large swathes of land having been purchased by ambitious land speculators, who many times don't even use the land but seek to sell it at a premium. This state of affairs cannot be allowed to remain, and while we will set a generous lower limit, it is time to break this cycle and make sure that unused land can be claimed by those who would actually make use of it."

ZES_modern_roads:0 "Fyrport-Seguro Railway"
ZES_modern_roads_desc:0 "There is an opportunity to kill two slavers with one stone, the countryside unemployment is maybe not as visible as in the city, but it is still there. Offering these now available workers employment building a railroad from one end of Kása to the other will not only put money into the economy, but if done right it will teach them skills for the future. We also get a really nice railway out of it too!"

ZES_model_villages:0 "Model Villages"
ZES_model_villages_desc:0 "We should do away with the notion that certain region of Kása are 'frontier regions'. In the distinction lies a devaluation: after all the opposite of frontier is heartland. Not a single square meter of Kása is less important than the heartland. Kása is one, and all of Kása shall prosper together!"

ZES_focus_on_interior:0 "Our Urban Centers"
ZES_focus_on_interior_desc:0 "Kása's cities are the economic engine that drives the nation, and responsible economic policy dictates that we must spend our money in the most efficient way. Our goal is the prosperity of the entire nation, and for that, our cities must be allowed to be the workhorses they were meant to be."

ZES_electrify_land:0 "Utility Poles and Power Plants"
ZES_electrify_land_desc:0 "A Gryphussian advisor recently suggested that as Kása's electrical grid expands, the state should make sure that it was highly controlled through the use of both patents and legislation so that our grip on the power supply was absolute. He was subsequently laughed out of the meeting before an open, modular system that will allow us to easily switch out and access every bit of it was adopted."

ZES_free_apartments:0 "Futurus Aparmentus"
ZES_free_apartments_desc:0 "Electricity, running water, indoor plumbing, these are all things that modern apartments are expected to have, but are they? We should aim to introduce these modern comforts to every last apartment in Kása, no matter where they are."

ZES_model_cities:0 "Cidades Modelo Brilhante"
ZES_model_cities_desc:0 "These once small outposts, founded by exhausted refugees and nearly broken slaves, have grown to be shining beacons of civilization. Not a civilization built on exploitation and tyranny either, but radiant jewels of freedom and prosperity."

ZES_damn_fireshore:0 "Inaugurate the Akeeku Dam"
ZES_damn_fireshore_desc:0 "Building statues are an exercise in vanity, and Lûa Ramedi has from the beginning been committed to the idea that if the founder of Kása should be honored in any way, it should be through something practical, something that provides for the nation and stands as a testament to more than its leaders' vanity."

ZES_plan_regions:0 "Merging the Counties"

ZES_irrigation_canals_desc:0 "Rivers are the lifeblood of many nations, yet Kása has only one. What she has, however, are mountains streams which can be diverted towards the farmlands, and which can help water our crops much more efficiently."

ZES_resettle_refugees:0 "The Home Plan"
ZES_resettle_refugees_desc:0 "Currently, the refugees make their homes in the rural border regions in government-sponsored camps.

ZES_rethink_capitalism_desc:0 "Capitalism has gone through a lot of changes as an ideology over its history.

ZES_avoid_skyfall_desc:0 "Skyfall is the prime example of corrupted capitalism, a land of filthy oligarchs and demonic corporations.

ZES_increased_taxation:0 "Increase the Tax Rate"
ZES_increased_taxation_desc:0 "Pasarinha's reforms are ambitious, and ambition generally requires funds.

ZES_cement_council_support_desc:0 "There are many likeminded councillors that Pasarinha can court to achieve his goals, but many do not fully trust the businesszebra.

ZES_parlay_with_lua:0 "Parlay with Lûa"
ZES_parlay_with_lua_desc:0 "As Mansu Erba's protege, Lûa still holds an air of prestige and power within the council. Working with him would provide us more support for our more ambitious reforms, and grant our regime legitimacy as the successor to the Avo's."

ZES_denounce_extremism_desc:0 "Extremism has no place in Kása! We are a proud democracy, and nothing shall stop that! While Pasarinha is more of an economics zebra than one for politics, he recognizes the importance of denouncing extremism so that Kása maintains its course as a proud democracy."

ZES_chamber_of_commerce:0 "Câmara do Comércio"
ZES_chamber_of_commerce_desc:0 "Pasarinha may be an intelligent Zebra, but he can not do all his work alone. Establishing an advisory council of industrialists and wealthy Zebras of Kása will allow us to always have creatures to consult for economic advice.

ZES_look_to_workers_desc:0 "The labor issue has long been prevalent in Kása. The issue of the refugees and how to provide for them has lead to a strong labor movement across the nation.

ZES_modern_police:0 "Organise Metropolitan Constabulary"
ZES_modern_police_desc:0 "Many times when large cities arise throughout the world, crime grows and festers within them.

ZES_public_health_system:0 "Universal Healthcare"
ZES_public_health_system_desc:0 "City living is a new thing for many creatures. Working long days in new job markets leaves openings for disease to slither in.

ZES_macawia_garrison_treaty_desc:0 "Macawia often views Kása as its little cousin on the shores of Griffonia.

ZES_disband_monopolies:0 "Divide the Companies"
ZES_disband_monopolies_desc:0 "Many large corporations and monopolies held Gryphus in their claws.

ZES_thorough_land_study:0 "Fund Mineral Investigation"
ZES_thorough_land_study_desc:0 "While it is easy to simply give permits for new companies, a key problem remains untouched; much of Kása's mountains and hills remain unsurveyed.

New regulations will be implemented to ensure that only good, quality products will be manuafactured in Kása."

ZES_car_production:0 "Mareland Automobile Innovation"
ZES_car_production_desc:0 "While automobles are widely known about, only the rich can really afford to import and maintain them. However, a new company seeks to change this matter; from New Mareland, the Sorraia seeks to move its entire production to Kása. They say the they simply cannot compete with its rivals.

ZES_services_sector:0 "Tertiary Sector"
ZES_services_sector_desc:0 "The third and final sector compromises all those companies who provide services to the population, such as stores and restaurants. While Pasarinha saw this mainly as the smallest sector of the three due to Kása's small population, a new idea from Bicoafi and Eala proposes an unorthodox addition to this sector — tourism."

ZES_renovate_castles:0 "Renovate the Castles"
ZES_renovate_castles_desc:0 "Ever since Sinóra's times, old castles have laid abandoned across Kása. Formerly seen as symbols of oppression, teams of archeologists, builders and representatives of the Ministry now travel across Kása to evaluate their current condition. Those that are found fit enough will be restored to act as hotels and other attractions for those seeking to live like the Wittenlandic nobles of the past. Even if only for a few days."

ZES_nature_reservations:0 "National Park Plan"
ZES_nature_reservations_desc:0 "For the longest time, the untamed wilderness in the northern areas was seen as a bleak landscape without any proper purpose. But in this untouched landscape also dwell many curious creatures and animals alongside a land not ruined by the modern world. Something that some mays wish to see and experience."

ZES_prepare_local_services:0 "Prepare Housing and Services"
ZES_prepare_local_services_desc:0 "In addition to providing attractions for the visitors to marvel at, they will need other services such as accommadations. The Ministry of Development has reserved a portion of money to fund the foundations of new hotels and the expansion of existing ones to cater to the need of tourists in addition to other minor ventures."

ZES_tourism:0 "Aberto a Birnís"
ZES_tourism_desc:0 "Only one step in our plan remains, as designed by Bicoafi: a massive advertisement campaign in Macawia and Griffonia about the wonders that Kása has. While the main focus will be upon rich visitors, part of the campaign will also be the affordability of trips designed for average working-class families. These budget holidays, carefully designed to be cost-effective, offer a chance for tourism at a scale not yet seen."

## Yrmthu route
ZES_yrmthu_elected:0 "Yrmthu's Vision"
ZES_yrmthu_elected_desc:0 "The Xatisa changed Kása and now, the new First Commander is the living proof of that change. Under her leadership, the Free State will attempt to reconcile with itself by renewing with the communal ideals of Akeeku, nay, with the First Village. Akeeku was but one among many great zebras."

ZES_talk_to_nation:0 "Public Speech"
ZES_talk_to_nation_desc:0 "Mansu Erba kept in touch with the nation by the way of radio broadcast. While no law forces her to do so, First Commander Yrmthu saw fit to continue this tradition and instill trust in the government. It shall be a first step towards opening a new dialogue in Kása."

ZES_enshrine_harmony:0 "Enshrine Harmony"
ZES_enshrine_harmony_desc:0 "As new interests in Kása become evermore entrenched, we must ensure that our idealistic foundation remains preserved. Kása is a land devoted to freedom and harmony of all beings. This seminal idea must be safeguarded against any threat, be they military, ideological or corporate."

ZES_macawian_friendship:0 "Amizadi Macawiana"
ZES_macawian_friendship_desc:0 "When she was elected, Yrmthu promised to turn her attention inwards, to the forgotten creatures of Kása. However, across the sea, we have a friend, one who is willing to help. And while we shouldn't be naive about them, we ought to cultivate this partnership."

ZES_send_agents:0 "Envie os Agentes"
ZES_send_agents_desc:0 "Creatures still reel under the hooves of their oppressors. In Barrad, in Austurland and Gryphus. It is time to initiate a surge of Skapatoria activity, to help those who can escape and to instill hope in those who cannot yet. Let us be passive no more!"

ZES_heal_society:0 "Heal Our Society"
ZES_heal_society_desc:0 "For all the patting on the back we give ourselves, the truth is that the Xatisa has scarred Kásan society. There remains distrust and grievances between the Barradian refugees and the Kásans. And not just among them. We need to remind ourselves that we are all, in the end, Kásans. By inheritance, choice or circumstances. We will stand together."

ZES_ban_left:0 "Denounce Marksist-Stallionism"
ZES_ban_left_desc:0 "The Marksist-Stallionist say they wish for a revolution to free every working creature on earth but we have quite a few Prywhenian refugees with tales of exactly how they go about it. Kása is a land in which citizens freed themselves and shall continue to do so. The black, red and green banner of hope will always be preferable to the bloody red."

ZES_ban_right:0 "Antivenom to Nationalism"
ZES_ban_right_desc:0 "Nationalists do like their fantastic tales of immanent nations transcending the ages to become homogenous nation-states. But the D'Vash and Ilha Rosca told another tale. Kása is no land of fantasy. It is a land for anyone who adheres to the ideal of freedom, cooperation and the pursuit of happiness. It is a land for the weary, for you and for me."

ZES_rip_bandage:0 "Rip the Bandage"
ZES_rip_bandage_desc:0 "Our prisons are full of those who were caught supporting the Pentarchy or the deer slavers as well as less than savory Kásans. For a long time, we saw these creatures as abnormals, put away from society and forgotten. However, we ought to confront them and allow for a peaceful path back to society. Yrmthu wants Kása's dirty laundry exposed rather than hidden."

ZES_unified_in_harmony:0 "Magiku di Amizadi"
ZES_unified_in_harmony_desc:0 "What is the meaning of Kása? Most will say it is freedom. Some even scream it to the skies. But what is freedom if the poor and rural has less say than the rich and urban? What is the freedom in begging? We need more than freedom. We need friendship. A home is built on more than freedom alone after all."

ZES_fight_illiteracy:0 "Light of Knowledge"
ZES_fight_illiteracy_desc:0 "The Livru Programa produced a lot of progress in the fight against illiteracy but much remains to be done. Efforts will be continued to increase literacy amongst the population. More funds will be diverted to the travelling schools and to the development of higher education faculties in Seguro."

ZES_in_every_village:0 "In Every Township"
ZES_in_every_village_desc:0 "The fundamental error in dealing with the Xatisa was to stuff them all in the camps around Oferclif, overloading the city. But our nation is a land of small villages and towns. We shall unite them in a mutual cooperation to house and feed the refugees. It will be a perfect pilot experiment for something grander."

ZES_seek_lua_support:0 "Appease the Establishment"
ZES_seek_lua_support_desc:0 "While Yrmthu had the popular support, many veteran councillors had supported Lûa Ramedi's campaign and he had the ears of many skeptics among the Kásan elite. To avoid any conflict with them, let us invite the zebra to join her in building a better Kása."

ZES_devolve_council_power:0 "Empower Direct Democracy"
ZES_devolve_council_power_desc:0 "The griffons and the river ponies complain endlessly about mob rule but there is wisdom in the community. Not the masses as the communists argue but in the local collectives. There will be the rock on which we build the future. It is time to devolve power back to the towns and villages where it first came from, right after we emerged from the damp decks of the D'Vash."

ZES_what_is_state:0 "O que é Stádu?"
ZES_what_is_state_desc:0 "Power has been given back to who it rightfully belongs to and yet, democracy is a culture. One we will have to learn once more after decades of centralised management. There will be mistakes and there will be ridicule but in the end, the towns will learn again and from that experience, true communities will emerge. Kása will be itself once more."

ZES_power_of_friendship:0 "Poder di Amizadi"
ZES_power_of_friendship_desc:0 "We gathered help from every level of Kása: the charities, the villages, the elites. But those efforts were still timid, disjointed. It's time to gather them all and coordinate and bring relief to the refugees. Together we'll end the Xatisa! As friends. As Kásans."

ZES_deconstruct_authority_complex:0 "Deconstruct Authority Complex"
ZES_deconstruct_authority_complex_desc:0 "Kása has been blessed by great leaders. Akeeku. Sínora. Mansu Erba. But this has been a curse in disguise. More and more, we moved away from the ideals of the First Village, giving ever more importance to the First Commander. We've beholden ourselves to an imperial leadership, a monarchy on a throne of dried reeds. This ends now."

ZES_devolved_power:0 "The Position of the Council"
ZES_devolved_power_desc:0 "Through the powers of the First Commander, much could be done to empower the communities of Kása but even its authority has limits, thank the spirits. For months, the Council has grumbled about the devolution of power. It is time to face them down and set the course for the future."

ZES_talk_to_experts:0 "Meet with Experts"
ZES_talk_to_experts_desc:0 "Democracy is a wonderful form of government. Yet, to succeed, the public and their servants need to be informed. And in the face of the Xatisa, we need new perspectives. For this purpose Yrmthu will call upon the learned to aid her in this endeavor."

ZES_wealth_taxation:0 "From Deep Pockets"
ZES_wealth_taxation_desc:0 "The First Village was founded on an ideal of equality and cooperation. Yet, inequality of wealth has become a reality in Kása, to the point that key individuals together have more than the government itself. Given how the government is struggling, it is time that those who enriched themselves thanks to our ideals give back to the community."

ZES_public_works_program:0 "Initiate Public Works Program"
ZES_public_works_program_desc:0 "Infrastructure of Kása is underdeveloped, especially in the mainland. Many towns are connected only by dirt paths. Yrmthu had the chance to experience it herself during the electoral convoy. Our people deserve better, and for this sake the government will invest in building paved roads and bridges to connect the townships."

ZES_refugee_charity_programs:0 "Collective Charity Efforts"
ZES_refugee_charity_programs_desc:0 "The state alone can only do so much to deal with the Xatisa. Yrmthu has seen its effect firsthoof. So, we need to swallow our pride and turn to those who would give willingly. Let's coordinate the charity efforts and give some relief to the refugees camps at Oferclif-Retorno."

ZES_new_local_factories:0 "Support Local Production"
ZES_new_local_factories_desc:0 "One would be hard pressed to enjoy industry. It is loud, dirty and oppressive. Yet, to ignore their use only means we will be at the mercy of the Macawian exports and the dreaded Gryps-Süd GmbH. We need to truly kickstart a local production and expand our native factories which remain in their infancy."

ZES_urban_growth:0 "Fresh Urban Development"
ZES_urban_growth_desc:0 "For too long, we have relied on the wealthy and the Macawian foreign investors to develop our town, leading only to squalor and runaway rent. To free our people from the clutches of immoral landlords, we need to invest in those cities and make sure that every citizen can live in dignity."

ZES_encourage_village_life:0 "Aid the Remote Towns"
ZES_encourage_village_life_desc:0 "For too long we have hoped that the plucky settlers of Kása would make a life for themselves by themselves in the mountains and remote plains of the country. The truth is that there is hardship that rugged individualism can only do so much to overcome. It is time to end the myth and give them aid."

ZES_strenghten_communities:0 "Local Communities"
ZES_strenghten_communities_desc:0 "For all the optimism of Kása, we can still feel it. Behind every corner lurks the sinister shadow of where Kásans came from. Slavery. The centralized state tried to heal that wound through care and proper leadership but it wasn't enough. Responsibility must be in the communities' hooves so that they can finally realize that free, they indeed are. And freedom is a never ending work."

ZES_local_not_global:0 "Local não Global"
ZES_local_not_global_desc:0 "Macawian help has been a boon for Kása but it came with strings attached. It tied us to the spirit of unfettered free trade and globalisation. But what place can we find in our world when we have so little and yet are forced to pay others rather than our neighbours? Let us restrict exports for now. It was too soon for us."

ZES_secure_food:0 "Kumida Baratu"
ZES_secure_food_desc:0 "The Pact of 907 was a wonderful thing but as we revise our obligations, so too must we be sincere friends and not expect the Macawians to provide for us. Self-reliance is our responsibility for our own benefit but also to our overseas friend. In time, we shall be able to support our sister republic like it supported us once. This is the spirit of growing, not that of hateful autarky."

ZES_wealth_of_community:0 "Riqueza di Comunidade"
ZES_wealth_of_community_desc:0 "As the communities grow their own foods and the industry produces our own products, we have been able to free up much capital that would have in the past gone to buying foodstuff and material on the international market. Now, it's time to invest that money into our future. With wealth comes the ability to invest and that we shall do."

ZES_to_north:0 "Vá Para o Norte"
ZES_to_north_desc:0 "Barrad. The word itself leave nocreature indifferent. There is a sickness in those mountains, lying in every castle stone, in every depraved corridor and in the heart of all those who serve the Pentarchy. No longer can Kása live in the shadow of the mountain. So let's go north and not come back until this is all over. There can be no hesitation in facing down madness."

ZES_emergency_aid:0 "Emergency Aid to the Townships"
ZES_emergency_aid_desc:0 "The Pentarchy never cared for the population, ruling over them as tyrants and leaving them naught but dirt to live off. And now the war has disrupted what little the populace had of food supply. They need emergency relief at all cost. We must not allow another Xatisa to occur!"

ZES_secure_mountain_holds:0 "Secure the Castles"
ZES_secure_mountain_holds_desc:0 "Many old fortifications lay scattered across the land, which were build by Wittenlandic nobles. Now, they remain as ruins of the old regime. They must be secured, so not bandits or dark mages may occupy them for any nefarious cause."

ZES_congress_opens:0 "O Congresso di Seguro"
ZES_congress_opens_desc:0 "Much has changed in Kása ever since Yrmthu was elected as First Commander. The energetic pony has now called upon a congress, where she, the Advisory Council and representatives from the local assemblies will convene to discuss matters of state and the tasks ahead."

ZES_organise_local_schools:0 "Support Local Schools"
ZES_organise_local_schools_desc:0 "Many communities have already formed their own educational facilities for the young and curious. But many others lack the resources. To alleviate the situation, Yrmthu will encourage and coordinate these smaller communities to pool their resources together for mutual benefit."

ZES_law_on_draft:0 "Decentralized Mobilization"
ZES_law_on_draft_desc:0 "It is vital that the state is defended and modern wars require vast forces. For this reason, Yrmthu will cooperate with the local assemblies to not only organise mobilisation but to also create local training units under local authorities."

ZES_redraw_assemblies:0 "Accurate and Fair Borders"
ZES_redraw_assemblies_desc:0 "The ancient councillor election borders used by the local assemblies are vastly outdated, with former small villages either nearly abandoned while former townships have turned into vast cities. To create a more accurate representation, a commission will be created to re-organise the political borders."

ZES_guild_of_charity:0 "Guild of Charity"
ZES_guild_of_charity_desc:0 "A group representing the many charities have appealed to the congress with an interesting proposition; to allow them to organise themselves into a guild focused to the cause of aiding the poor. This has been met with wholehearted approval by the whole congress."

ZES_matter_of_coin:0 "About Coins and Economy"
ZES_matter_of_coin_desc:0 "A curious problem has arisen across Kása; as the economy has become decentralized, so too has money. Various communities have adopted their own coins, usable only in local markets. This is, however, causing issues in nation-wide commerce and fears of counterfeiting. To protect the economy, a central bank will be created with the sole power to mint money."

ZES_final_congress_decree:0 "The Closing Topic"
ZES_final_congress_decree_desc:0 "As the congress reaches its end, the First Commander takes her spot by the podium for one final discussion; one over the essence and spirit of Kása."

ZES_austurland_resolution:0 "Look to Austurland"
ZES_austurland_resolution_desc:0 "The deer vikingar have always stood as a direct threat to Kása and as a bastion of slavery in eastern Griffonia. In order to secure the confederation's existence and further our cause, an eternal peace must be forged one way or another."

ZES_abandon_longships:0 "Abandonar as Naves"
ZES_abandon_longships_desc:0 "The age of raiding must come to an end. Instead, the former vikingar will be guided to live their lives in peace and friendship with their neighbours."

ZES_forgive_them:0 "Perdoe Eles"
ZES_forgive_them_desc:0 "Thralldom was a cruel institution propped by greed and willful blindness. However, vengeance is not the answer. Instead, Yrmthu will attempt to promote peace between the victims and those who supported the slavery in the name of universal friendship."

ZES_limited_coordination:0 "Limited Coordination"
ZES_limited_coordination_desc:0 "To empower each and every Kásan is our goal but we ought to ensure that coordination and cooperation remain possible, for the benefit of all. After all, not all regions are equal and we ought to make the best use of our common wealth so that the least blessed by geography can still thrive. Though the pill may be a bit hard to swallow to the most privileged local councils."

ZES_ensure_trade_routes:0 "Expand the Railways"
ZES_ensure_trade_routes_desc:0 "Travelling across Kása has always been a pain. Yrmthu could experience it firsthoof even when she was running for First Commander and conflict hasn't helped since. It is time to remedy this in collaboration with all communities in Kása. Who doesn't like trains anyway? Choo choo!"

ZES_seek_out_resources:0 "Wealth of the Land"
ZES_seek_out_resources_desc:0 "Kása has always been a rich land but there has always been a reluctance to exploit it. With little know-how and capital, we would have had to rely on Macawia or private investors to exploit it, with all that entails. But now, we can finally get started and be sure that all and any profit will go to the community rather than to pay for some rich magnat's oil painting."

ZES_found_foundries:0 "Construir Fundições"
ZES_found_foundries_desc:0 "As iron, coal and oil are coming out of Kása's soil, new opportunities are emerging for a war industry. We shouldn't rely on foreign purchases to equip those who would defend us. Our ancestors in Zebrica were master metallurgist after all. It's time to bring that back, with our own little twist on the old recipe!"

ZES_national_mining_industry:0 "Setor Nasional di Mineração"
ZES_national_mining_industry_desc:0 "As we have opened extraction operation, there has been a renewed interest in surveying the land. Previous mining projects that would have been unprofitable are now being put back on the table as we gather more and more equipment and personal. Let's invest in those so that all in Kása may reap the rewards of such hard work!"

ZES_mutual_industrial_development:0 "Merge Industrial Developments"
ZES_mutual_industrial_development_desc:0 "Small local communities can never support vast industrial development alone. It would, instead, be better if these assemblies would plan together for mutual benefit. There will be plenty of difficulties ahead but it is important that we don't fall back to cottage industries when we could do so much more and benefit together."

ZES_electrification:0 "Power-Up the Communities"
ZES_electrification_desc:0 "Electrification has been a long and old issue in Kása, ever since the industrial revolution swept through Griffonia. We were able to power most of our biggest cities, with priority to Seguro. But now, we have the means to do more. We can no longer accept to see the day end with the setting sun. A functioning lightbulb in every home is no longer too much to ask."

ZES_standard_education_scheme:0 "Assembly of Education"
ZES_standard_education_scheme_desc:0 "Education, by its very nature, is a from-the-top institution. While 2+2 equalling 4 does not change from village to village, there is still a vital need for local input into education. Let us set up an Assembly depending on the Council with representatives from all over to discuss education in a way that can help all trust our school system better."

ZES_local_needs:0 "Local Education Schemes"
ZES_local_needs_desc:0 "Instituting an oversight body to inspect our communities would be a crime against their natural rights. It is far better if they are allowed to develop and manage their own education needs without the central authority getting involved, and to better suit their local needs. Who better to decide how to teach the youth than their own parents and communities?"

ZES_ink_act:0 "Tinta e Kaneta"
ZES_ink_act_desc:0 "In the modern age, it is as vital to know how to read than it is to walk or knowing which end of the shovel digs. We ought to finally crush illiteracy by requiring every resident of Kása to be able to read or write and mandate those who can't to follow a course to remedy the problem. Both at the confederal and local level, all are in agreements on this."

ZES_mansu_diploma_program:0 "Concessão do Diploma di Mansu Erba"
ZES_mansu_diploma_program_desc:0 "Despite our great advances in education, many Kásans still can't follow superior education. Perhaps it is time to institute a program of grants distributed to various communities to remove the funding burden. And who better to name it after than our late Avo?"

ZES_liberalized_economy:0 "Local Economies"
ZES_liberalized_economy_desc:0 "Despite pushback from Seguro politicians, we will move forward with our plan to liberalize and decentralize economic oversight. If the communities have no say in such matters, we may as well not bother with our confederal vision. And after all, the Ilhas Lagostas thrived thanks not to centralization but to cooperation and local wisdom."

ZES_organize_farmers_markets:0 "Support Farmers' Markets"
ZES_organize_farmers_markets_desc:0 "Many Kásans are still farmers or artisans and yet, they are forced to rely on intermediaries or sell to exporters and have a hard time competing with stores and imports. Let's ease the legal and financial burden resting on local markets so that anyone producing crops or other products may profit from them without having to pay someone else to sell them when they can."

ZES_give_out_the_land:0 "Gift Unused Land"
ZES_give_out_the_land_desc:0 "With the crisis in Barrad finally over, a great deal of land previously too dangerous to be safely settled remained unused or emptied themselves as creatures would move to the safer coast. Now, it's time to put them to good use, by making sure that so many Kásans can now start their own communities, on their own terms. To do this in another way would betray our history."

ZES_farming_mechanisation:0 "Modern Agricultural Machinery"
ZES_farming_mechanisation_desc:0 "Farming techniques remain extremely simple and are very often obsolete. It is no wonder after all since many had to make do with little capital to acquire or means to make modern equipment. But now, as our situation improved and we no longer need to dedicate so much funding to the Xatisa relief or the Barrad border, we can help all communities to get their hooves on modern equipment."

ZES_luxury_spices:0 "The Rare Herbs"
ZES_luxury_spices_desc:0 "As local markets began to open up, some gourmet creatures began to notice that rural families had been cultivating a great many deals of forgotten or rare herbs. Many such plants were brought from abroad by refugees and carefully adapted to the local climate. In a way, we've just found out that Kásans succeeded on their own in doing what would have cost millions to do with professional botanists."

ZES_global_drink:0 "Bebida Kenti Global"
ZES_global_drink_desc:0 "The recent spice boom has opened up so many opportunities, especially in producing the "Bebida Kenti" herbal blend for infusions and flavoured drinks. Perhaps we have a shot at making bank on this and profiting from a new export for the benefit of all communities rather than through some private corporation. And to think, it could have all remained little and forgotten herbs gardens."

ZES_diversify_economy:0 "Diversificar a Economia"
ZES_diversify_economy_desc:0 "The confederal reforms brought about an agrarian boom in Kása but agriculture is tricky and our lands are too rough to make a future out of it. We ought to adapt for the modern age and prepare for the future by investing the farmer's product in new industrial community projects so that our economy can diversify. It's a farmer's wisdom to not put all of our eggs in the same basket after all!"

ZES_modern_confederation:0 "Foundations of Our Modern Confederation"
ZES_modern_confederation_desc:0 "The Congress of Seguro laid out the road ahead and we walked through it proudly, doing our best to avoid any potholes. But now, it's time to codify it all and finally"

ZES_tour_the_land:0 "Tour The Land"
ZES_tour_the_land_desc:0 "As the Confederal reforms are rolling out, it is not time to sit back and enjoy the Seguro sun. Rather, it's the perfect time to celebrate and tour Kása to meet everypony. Maybe we'll even hear a little bit of feedback here and there!"

ZES_meet_ambassador:0 "Meeting with the Macawians"
ZES_meet_ambassador_desc:0 "Much has happened in just a few years. From a tiny nation on the verge of disaster and bankruptcy to a thriving emerging small power. And credit goes to where credit is due, our sister republic across the sea has helped. Let us meet with them to thank them and to reintroduce them to their little sister. All grown up as we are, they might not recognize us!"

ZES_dissolve_borders:0 "Dissolution of National Borders"
ZES_dissolve_borders_desc:0 "Kása is the land of the free. For all of our history, we've welcomed all. Slaves, exiles, refugees. We've been met with invaders, vikingars, pirates and disasters. And yet, we stood. It is time to abolish border enforcement altogether so ideals and law are final in accordance. All are welcome! And for those who would threaten us: better than you have tried and failed."

ZES_second_congress:0 "The Second Congress of Seguro"
ZES_second_congress_desc:0 "Reports have come in from all over Kása about disagreements between communities and even instances of violence. We need to address those matter immediately or everything that Yrmthu and all who believed in her message worked so hard to achieve will have been for nothing. If Kása is divided against itself, it won't stand for long. "

ZES_regulations_on_magic:0 "Regulations on the Practise of Magic"
ZES_regulations_on_magic_desc:0 "Many recent incidents have been caused by a visceral fear of magic users, often accused of being sympathizers of the defunct Pentarchy. But this is no paranoia, Yrmthu herself saw firsthoof the dangers of magic. We ought to establish a confederal set of regulations to prevent any problem and create a license system to responsibilize each and every magic users."

ZES_hogwarts:0 "Horsford School of Spellcraft and Alchemy"
ZES_hogwarts_desc:0 "As the magic regulations were being rolled out, Yrmthu pondered a great deal on how to make them work and endure on the long-term. This lead her to design a new project, one of a mandatory school dedicated to educating magic users in the proper way of practicing it and administrating the handing out of magic licences. Such a place would likely be special and complex to manage. But Kása is full of able creatures."

ZES_national_negotiations:0 "Elevate Council Negotiations"
ZES_national_negotiations_desc:0 "As we empowered local communities, we cannot just let them struggle on their own. Rather, we ought to figure out a new common social contract, not one directed from the top but stemming from the grassroots. In the end, we are all in this together, just like the slaves of the D'Vash once were. The confederal government must be able to offer its help and advice and help instill a spirit of cooperation. If one fails, we all do."

ZES_enforce_cooperation_laws:0 "Reminder About Friendship"
ZES_enforce_cooperation_laws_desc:0 "To heal the rifts of Xatisa-era Kása, we promoted a spirit of friendship to all but as we overcame the rifts left behind by our Avo, we lost sight of this. We need to better enforce confederal regulations and mandates on communities to cooperate. We are a confederation united in friendship, not a collection of egocentric castle owners."

ZES_greater_good:0 "O Bem Maior"
ZES_greater_good_desc:0 "As the Second Congress finishes its work, it is time for First Commander Yrmthu to address it in a closing speech. There are great expectations after so many accused her of doing nothing and shifting blame to others. But she'll rise to the occasion. For to lead is not to project eternal and constant strength but to take responsibility. It is about the common good and there is only shame in not correcting a mistake."

ZES_visit_family:0 "Family Visit"
ZES_visit_family_desc:0 "As the dust finally begin to settle on the reinvigorated confederation, the First Commander's agenda begins to clear itself too. And so, perhaps it is time to once more get out of Seguro. But what ought a simple mare to do except to finally get on the train and visit the family? Back to where it all began. In Retorno."

ZES_collective_identity:0 "Many Identities Under One Banner"
ZES_collective_identity_desc:0 "When one thinks of Kása, one is quick to picture a zebra but we are so much more than that. We are creatures of all stripes and we stand for an ideal, not for some imported zebrican national spirit. We do not demand assimilation or class loyalty, for to be Kásan is to simply be yourself, in free community and solidarity with your neighbours."

ZES_shared_struggle:0 "Our Shared Struggle"
ZES_shared_struggle_desc:0 "Kása has always been defined by a struggle for its future. The details of such the struggle may differ depending on the time and situation but its spirit remains the same in every case. Together, united in our beloved diversity, we will fight for the freedom of all, no matter creed or class. Let a Kásan flag flying in the wind instill fear in tyrants and slavers but not in the heart of innocent neighbours."

ZES_skapatoria_reformation:0 "Modern Skapatoria Programa"
ZES_skapatoria_reformation_desc:0 "As the threat on Kása's borders is slowly waning, some have begun to worry about the Skapatoria Programa and its power. Some call it a secret police in waiting but these warnings are but alarmist calls and the well-respected agents are in to save lives, not ruin them. Many dangerous elements still lurk in the shadows. It is vital that the agency is equipped to deal with anything seeking to harm the confederation."

ZES_electronics_development:0 "Eletrônica Moderna"
ZES_electronics_development_desc:0 "There was a time when the ability to track hoof steps and listen in to conversations were among the greatest skills of a Skapatoria agent. Recent developments in electronics have opened new avenues for protecting our information and uncovering what the tyrants wishes to hide. Kása must not lag behind on this field if it wishes to remain safe."

ZES_kasan_volunteer_legion:0 "Legião Akeeku"
ZES_kasan_volunteer_legion_desc:0 "Recent reports have alarmed Yrmthu; wherever she looks, harmony and democracy are threatened by tyrants. The Pentarchy might have collapsed but the struggle moves on! Those who stand for harmony must not be left alone! Kása will stand, side by side, with its harmonic brethren and Akeeku's Legion will be there to defend freedom."

ZES_altu_kexa_elected_desc:0 "Áltu Kexa, the famous poetess, has taken office. Passionate, militant and an idealist, she believes the ends justify the means — and that all will be liberated, no matter the cost. It is time for the tyrants of the world to learn what it means to be afraid."

ZES_persuade_council:0 "Persuade the Astray"
ZES_persuade_council_desc:0 "A large majority of the advisory council is made up of older more experienced politicians. While their wisdom is useful, it seems they have lost the plot. If Áltu is to proceed with her plans, she will need support however. They need to know how and why she was voted in... And that it's her way or the Highway."

ZES_talk_to_rich:0 "Discussões de Champanhe"
ZES_talk_to_rich_desc:0 "The wealthy have the means to achieve much but can rarely be bothered to do so. Forcing them will do naught but cause them to leave or to oppose us. Instead, let us remind them about our past struggles and their families' origins. That will convince them to aid us. And should anything else, we can always butter them up."

ZES_issue_bonds:0 "Issue Defence Bonds"
ZES_issue_bonds_desc:0 "Even the most just wars need money. However, it would be unwise to indebt ourselves to foreign capital. Rather, some national bonds should help to both rouse the populace and provide a less dangerous source of income. Our people will surely arise to this task for the sake of common good."

ZES_public_private_cooperation:0 "Private In Service of the Public"
ZES_public_private_cooperation_desc:0 "Thanks to the generous donations from the affluent, we should be able to invest and develop our budding industrial sector. It's a slow process and one that might benefit the burgeoning Kásan elite but it'll be worth it."

ZES_purchase_rifles:0 "Deals With the Merchants of Death"
ZES_purchase_rifles_desc:0 "Simple passion is not enough. Our people need weapons and we cannot await for the industry to catch up. Instead, we will look out to the world and buy what we lack. Even if it means meeting with the lowest creatures of this world. They will get their comeuppance eventually but for now, we have bigger fish to fry."

ZES_train_refugees:0 "Treinar Para a Luta"
ZES_train_refugees_desc:0 "Put the word out! Any refugee who wishes to return home are encouraged to enlist. We'll make sure the former serfs are trained and able to take back their homes from the oppressors!"

ZES_contact_barrad_civilians:0 "To The Innocent in Barrad"
ZES_contact_barrad_civilians_desc:0 "Those who couldn't escape Barrad are stuck under the oppressive regime! Contact those who remained, and tell them we are coming. And that nobody will stand in the way of our righteous justice! Let hope blossom in the blighted mountains!"

ZES_macawian_support:0 "Suporte Macawia"
ZES_macawian_support_desc:0 "Barrad is burning and the ponies of the mountains who could flee the rule of the Pentarchy are pouring in Kása. Yet for years, Macawia stood on the roadside while the Xatisa hurts all of us. Let us appeal to them, to their love of freedom and democracy. They will surely aid us, for our struggle is shared and just!"

ZES_our_cause:0 "Nós Causa"
ZES_our_cause_desc:0 "Kása's cause is that of freedom. From the day we stepped off of the D'Vash to the beaches of Ilha Roscas, it was our duty and destiny to lead the fight for freedom. For too long we have played second fiddle to Macawia. No more. Barrad will be our opening act, our warning to the world, our time to shine at last. We will earn the right to carry the banner of freedom by ourselves!"

ZES_old_liberator:0 "The Old Liberator"
ZES_old_liberator_desc:0 "Áltu isn't a soldier, this much is known. She is a passionate poetess and a simple zebra. But there is someone else. One who embodies the ideal of radical abolitionism and the struggle for freedom. A griffon veteran of wars gone by and robbed of his homeland, and she could use his help."

ZES_monument_to_be_fallen:0 "Monument of To-Be Fallen"
ZES_monument_to_be_fallen_desc:0 "There is but one certainly when it comes to war; people will die and we wish to honor them. Let us erect a monument in preparation for those who will sacrifice themselves in the name of liberty."

ZES_ignore_council:0 "Ignore the Naive"
ZES_ignore_council_desc:0 "These older politicians are a spineless and pathetic lot. Áltu does not have the precious commodity of time to tend to their ridiculous needs. We have a war to plan, people to liberate! She will not offer them her attention."

ZES_forced_loans:0 "Make Them Loan"
ZES_forced_loans_desc:0 "The hard truth is that the government needs money. For this sake, Áltu will declare that everyone in Kása must do their part for the common good. It'll pay off in the end."

ZES_stick_and_carrot:0 "Sinóra e Pó"
ZES_stick_and_carrot_desc:0 "Áltu proclaims an ultimatum to the decadent and debaucherous rich; cooperate or else! We are trying to do good, and them thinking they can just sit around thinking it'll all be fine is a ridiculous notion. They too must do their part and such is the price we ask for allowing them to claim more than their fair share!"

ZES_nationalize_industry:0 "Nationalise Crucial Industries"
ZES_nationalize_industry_desc:0 "Hard measures must be taken to secure military production for the liberation. Áltu will nationalise vital industries and make them adopt streamlined and modern industrial structures to produce military equipment."

ZES_conscript_refugees:0 "Liberte Seu Barrad"
ZES_conscript_refugees_desc:0 "Spread the word in the camps of Oferclif for we are going back to Barrad with cannons in tow! Arm the refugees! They too will fight to take back their homes and, with their help, we will overrun Barrad and make the enemy pay!"

ZES_gather_old_weapons:0 "Dust Off the Old Arms"
ZES_gather_old_weapons_desc:0 "We simply lack the weapons to equip our forces. For this sake, Áltu will call upon the population to donate their old firearms, ones given to them by the state centuries ago or privately acquired ones. What good is to pepper off the vermin when war rages on?"

ZES_prepare_for_war:0 "Heed Me, Tyrants of Barrad"
ZES_prepare_for_war_desc:0 "O Barrad. O tyrants. For many years, you have plundered and oppressed, ruined a region and sent their people to die on the roads. We hope you cherished these years and enjoyed your robbed wealth for those you oppressed are walking back home. Now comes the time to pay. Now comes your due: the loveliest of nooses."

ZES_noblest_cause:0 "Na Causa Sagrada di Liberdade"
ZES_noblest_cause_desc:0 "All the preparations are finally done and the time has come to liberate Barrad. Now all must do their part and arise to the task ahead for it is what Kása stands for! Fear our wrath, fear our just anger! The liberation comes."

ZES_cleanse_monsters:0 "No Quarter for Beasts"
ZES_cleanse_monsters_desc:0 "Under the Pentarchy, wild beasts roamed the land, growing stronger as the black magic of the Wretched Five corrupted and twisted them. We will send our best to fight them and clean the lands of Barrad."

ZES_establish_havens:0 "Shelters From the Storms"
ZES_establish_havens_desc:0 "Despite the castles of the Wretched Five burning, Barrad still has to endure the unnatural storms caused by their insane experiments. Alas, we won't be able to solve this in a day. We will dig in and build strategic bunkers and shelters for the people to hide in when storm hits."

ZES_hang_them:0 "Clean-Cut Affair"
ZES_hang_them_desc:0 "The five rulers of the Pentarchy are gone but it is wrong to blame them for all their crimes for a regime is more than just their rulers. There were sergeants enforcing their laws, administrators robbing the peasants of their crops while they starve and worse. We have their names and they too shall face justice for what they did in Barrad."

ZES_barrad_comission:0 "Comissão Barrad"
ZES_barrad_comission_desc:0 "A commission will be established to oversee Barrad's affairs as well as the reconstruction, resettlement and cleansing of the land. It will be a long time before that land may see light once more but we Kásans do not fear hard work in the name of freedom."

ZES_fortress_of_freedom:0 "Fortress of Freedom"
ZES_fortress_of_freedom_desc:0 "Barrad is free but its liberation did not come without its cost. To overstretch ourselves now might give ideas to neighbouring powers. Kása must now secure its existence, so that its freedom will not be squashed and any tyrant will be thrown back."

ZES_talk_to_economists:0 "Talk to the Economists"
ZES_talk_to_economists_desc:0 "Kása's economy lays in state of limbo since the conflict. Already weak well before Áltu even took office, Kása will need far-reaching reforms if it is to avoid financial collapse and a possible Macawian bailout. We can't allow that to happen. Perhaps it is time to meet with these economists who prefered Ramedi or Pasarinha and sway them."

ZES_limit_big_business:0 "Anti-Monopoly Measures"
ZES_limit_big_business_desc:0 "The concentration of wealth is a scourge on the land and the root of tyranny. Yet we can already see the seeds of such entrenchment of the elites in our beloved Kása. Decrees and edicts will be placed to limit size of private companies so they cannot become too powerful or rich who are mostly non-local."

ZES_support_local:0 "Aid the Small Artisans"
ZES_support_local_desc:0 "For a long time, Kása has had issues competing with cheap foreign import, especially the Macawian goods and the smuggled Gryps-Süd GmbH merchandise. We will give small business funds and state protection so that they are not threatened by international markets."

ZES_economic_protectionism:0 "Léi di Proteção"
ZES_economic_protectionism_desc:0 "The state can only do so much to help a just economy flourish if cheaper foreign goods are just next to ours on the stores' shelves. To help make up the gap, new tariffs and quotas for imports will be put in place to protect local economy."

ZES_right_of_work:0 "Right of Work"
ZES_right_of_work_desc:0 "Unemployment is an abhorrent societal disease that must be eliminated. We will provide employment for all, either in special community project, local government, non-combatant military logistics or state-sponsored private industry. Nopony shall be locked in poverty."

ZES_lifetime_education:0 "Prendison Perpétu"
ZES_lifetime_education_desc:0 "Education should not end after school nor should older creatures be afraid of learning. One only has to look at Áltu's husband for example. One ought to learn for their entire lifetime and new institutions and educational groups across the land will strive to share this passion with all."

ZES_no_riches_or_rags:0 "No Rags or Riches"
ZES_no_riches_or_rags_desc:0 "Throughout history, creaturekind has been obsessed with the accumulation of wealth, even more so in Griffonia where the bigots believe griffons are born to do so. Yet, it is a meaningless goal, unable to bring happiness. True love and the absence of misery are the only true wealth. Such is our ethos."

ZES_plots_for_refugees:0 "Lands for the Landless"
ZES_plots_for_refugees_desc:0 "Kása, despite being small, still has plenty of land to share. We will gift this land to those in need, so that they make use of it and rebuild their lives for good. For what point is there in holding on to plains and forests while the common creature wastes away in the streets or the tents of Oferclif."

ZES_mansu_livru_legacy:0 "To Fulfill A Dream"
ZES_mansu_livru_legacy_desc:0 "Mansu Erba wished to eradicate illiteracy from Kása. It was a worthwhile desire though the Xatisa prevented her from dedicating enough resource to truly end this terrible situation. We will finish her job today."

ZES_ideal_life:0 "Ideal Life"
ZES_ideal_life_desc:0 "The greatest mistake in modernity is to try and sell the ideal of city life as the new norm. Yet, cities often come with squalor and overcrowding when the simple life in the countryside brings so much more. Kása should strive to allow for everyone to be whom they wish to be and one should be able to afford the ruran bliss."

ZES_happiness_in_simplicity:0 "Felisidadi na Simplicidade"
ZES_happiness_in_simplicity_desc:0 "Happiness is what life must strive for and Kása stands to help everycreature find it without excess. There is no need for sprawling forest of bricks and concrete nor for palaces adorned with golden leaves. There is joy in simplicity and we Kásans understand that."

ZES_free_intellectual_pursuit:0 "Common Knowledge and Wisdom"
ZES_free_intellectual_pursuit_desc:0 "Ignorance is a disease that none should suffer from. Even if we pursue a simple life, that does not mean we are simple-minded. Rather, freed from both wanton materialistic greed and misery, we are free to pursue higher ideals and goals such as high learning."

ZES_need_for_defence:0 "Weapons for Defence"
ZES_need_for_defence_desc:0 "Kása's freedom is an ideal that must be upheld against the tyrants. For its sake we must forge weapons to fight back any who threatens us."

ZES_eulogy_for_dead:0 "Eulogy for the Dead"
ZES_eulogy_for_dead_desc:0 "The Barrad Liberation left both soldiers and civilians dead. And with the monument to the fallen completed, it is time to bury those we have lost in these hallowed grounds. We must honour them and also those who perished under the cruel tyranny of the Pentarchy."

ZES_remind_of_duty:0 "Relenbra di Divere"
ZES_remind_of_duty_desc:0 "Even in peace, Kása must never forget its responsibility. There are some who see us fail, who see us in chains again and who would burn Ilha Roscas to the ground. We must remain vigilant lest all our sacrifices will have been for nothing. Everyone must be ready to do their part in defending our freedom."

ZES_plan_cells:0 "Plan Resistance Cells"
ZES_plan_cells_desc:0 "As terrible as the idea is, there may be a day when the Sun-spangled Flag won't fly over our cities, when oppressors would rule us again. And should this happen, we must prepare the resistance so that hope can remain. We will form secret groups of local civilians trained to fight a guerilla war against any enemy force with weapons cache and secret paths. If we are denied peace, we will make our oppressors' life unbearable."

ZES_defence_plans:0 "Sinóra Line"
ZES_defence_plans_desc:0 "It is unfeasible for us to defend our entire land. For this sake, we will fortify our core areas upon the island and peninsula, creating an impenetrable line of bunkers and trenches from where we can bounce back when the enemy's guard is down."

ZES_armed_society:0 "Sociedade Armada"
ZES_armed_society_desc:0 "Limiting access to weapons does us no good. If we cannot trust our citizens, then how can we expect them to trust us? Arms should be common part of our daily life as any other tool is. And should war come to us, there will be a rifle behind every blade of grass to meet whoever would be foolish enough to come."

ZES_peace_guardians:0 "Guardians of Peace"
ZES_peace_guardians_desc:0 "It would be a waste to simply demobilize willing and able veterans. Therefore Áltu has decreed the formation of a new security force to ensure rapid deployment against any perceived threats in and out of Kása. They shall be the pillar on which we will build our defense."

ZES_declare_neutrality:0 "Sozinhu"
ZES_declare_neutrality_desc:0 "Kása has no imperialistic visions and has no desire to be entangled in unjust wars. For this sake, we declare ourselves neutral from any foreign politics. We won't make the same mistakes as the righteous ones in Bakara, Ponaidhean or the River Republic fooled by the promises of the Coltstream Treaty. We are a free and sovereign nation."

ZES_aid_the_small:0 "Ambassadors of Peace"
ZES_aid_the_small_desc:0 "Even if we prefer peace, this does not mean we must stand isolated and alone in this world. How can we inspire others to follow in our hoofsteps if we refuse to talk to them? Kása will extend her hoof to those who too stand for harmony so we can plant the seeds of freedom like Macawia did with us."

ZES_safeguarding_democracy:0 "Our Democracy"
ZES_safeguarding_democracy_desc:0 "Kása's democracy must remain sacrosanct and the foundation of our nation. To ensure this much and finally appease those who feared that Áltu would become a tyrant, she has declared that First Commander's position will from here on be an annually elected position instead one set for a lifetime."

ZES_fund_defence_agency:0 "Agência do Fundo"
ZES_fund_defence_agency_desc:0 "It is important we know what our foes may plan. For this purpose, we will expand the Skapatoria Programa to be a fully fledged intelligence agency. We need eyes in every capitals and in every places where slaves still have to utter those most horrid of words: "Thank you, master.""

ZES_austurland_plan:0 "Planu Austurland"
ZES_austurland_plan_desc:0 "For too long, Austurland has acted as a bane on our existence. Not content to oppress their own, the deers of the east raided our coast, enslaving or maiming innocent creatures for naught but greed and bloodlust. We will deal with them and free the thralls!"

ZES_break_estates:0 "Break the Estates"
ZES_break_estates_desc:0 "Land and wealth in Austurland has long been concentrated in large estates worked by thralls and owned by the nobility. We will break them apart, distribute land to the freed thralls and use the financial assets to pay reparation and fund the pacification of the deer lands. Finally, there is justice for generations of slaves."

ZES_shatter_wicked_traditions:0 "Talk to the Berserkers"
ZES_shatter_wicked_traditions_desc:0 "In a strange twist of fate, we have discovered the existence of a sect in Austurland called the Berserkers, dedicated to the cause of aiding all. Perhaps, we could enlist their services?"

ZES_investigate_land:0 "Map the Land"
ZES_investigate_land_desc:0 "For all their greed, the jarls of Austurland were rather mediocre when it came to economics. From all accounts, there is a wealth of resources in these lands that have gone unexploited. We shall send experts to evaluate them. It is time we put those resources to good use and use the profit to help repair the damages of thralldom."

ZES_vanguard_of_liberation:0 "Vanguard of Liberation"
ZES_vanguard_of_liberation_desc:0 "Barrad was but the stepping stone for our grand war of liberation. In the North and in the West, there are still wanton oppression and Kása must not remain put. It must do its part to make the world a better place, to ensure that all creatures can live in freedom. Such is our duty and burden."

ZES_industrial_duty:0 "Industrial Revolution"
ZES_industrial_duty_desc:0 "War has changed since the days when it was enough to gather plucky adventurers to stand against overwhelming odds. Now, war is industrial and it is not only soldiers who fight. Workers, too, are at the forefront of modern war and we will ensure that they know well their part in the struggle."

ZES_liberation_curriculum:0 "To Learn of Liberty"
ZES_liberation_curriculum_desc:0 "Education is a right for all and the key to beating back ignorance. But part of the education should also teach us to love freedom and understand why it is important to us. For what else than a lover of freedom could an educated creature be?"

ZES_freedom_poetry:0 "Poziâ Pa Heróis"
ZES_freedom_poetry_desc:0 "Áltu is known for her love of poetry and recently she has composed a new one to commemorate those that have fallen in the cause of liberty. This has encapsulated the public to remember the fallen and pick up their cause."

ZES_worker_soldiers:0 "Worker-Soldiers"
ZES_worker_soldiers_desc:0 "Strange events have taken place across Kása; workers in the factories have formed impromptu workers battalions and began fire practise together on their free time. Áltu has praised their initiative, giving governmental support for it despite fears of some owners."

ZES_white_book:0 "Branku Livru"
ZES_white_book_desc:0 "A new poem collection has recently been published by Áltu, focusing on an issue she feels strongly about, that of neutrality. For a creature can not be neutral in the struggle between the oppressor and the freedom fighter. Taking no side means you are complacent in the suffering of the serf and slave."

ZES_militant_harmony:0 "Our Life for Others"
ZES_militant_harmony_desc:0 "Kása has seen great changes under the rule of Áltu Kexa. She has shown to Kása that harmony is simply not something to be enjoyed but also something dear. Now, it stands ready to follow her order to liberate those beyond our borders so they too can live free."

ZES_decry_the_dragons:0 "Disgrasa os Drágas"
ZES_decry_the_dragons_desc:0 "What point is there in extreme wealth? When a creature owns more than an entire city, what do they provide? How many houses do they build, what roads do they maintain and what electricity do they produce? Nothing. Instead, they hoard away their gold like dragons, parading about in their golden halls. Shame on them."

ZES_kinder_capitalism:0 "Kinder Capitalism"
ZES_kinder_capitalism_desc:0 "Slanderous rumours claim that Áltu Kexa is a communist who wants to get rid the wealthy in the name of marksist-stallionism. This is simply not true; she merely wishes them to be saved from decadent greediness and instead make the world a better place with their wealth."

ZES_redefine_wealth:0 "Redefinir a Riqueza"
ZES_redefine_wealth_desc:0 "Wealth can be so much more than just material goods. It can be a tool to help many escape poverty and free themselves from material constraints and the struggle for survival. Such freedom is the condition of a true pursuit of happiness rather than simply the unending quest to acquire more.. Áltu will encourage such thought across the nation."

ZES_happy_utopia:0 "A Better Society"
ZES_happy_utopia_desc:0 "A bright future lays ahead in the horizon, where competition and rivalry have been replaced with cooperation and friendship. There may still be hurdles on our path forward but we now know how to fight them off in a true Kásan spirit. If Akeeku could see what we have achieved, nocreature would dare say he wouldn't approve."

ZES_form_cooperatives:0 "Form Co-Operatives"
ZES_form_cooperatives_desc:0 "For too long, we have left the organization of labor to the wealthy, in perhaps the worst inspiration we took from the Macawians. Nearly gone is the spirit of cooperation of those who stepped out of the D'Vash. We will dictate that all large businesses will need to transform into cooperatives where their ownership is shared between the owners and the workers."

ZES_consumer_development:0 "Ngábar a Indústria di Consumo"
ZES_consumer_development_desc:0 "Kása now has gathered the means to fund new ventures and invest. But we ought to be careful as to not lose ourselves in our quest for liberation. We will invest in the civilian economy for the war against tyranny is meaningless if we do not care for our own citizens like the conquerors of old."

ZES_military_development:0 "Ngábar a Indústria di Militar"
ZES_military_development_desc:0 "The war of liberation requires bullets and in this modern age, we cannot afford to be on the losing side of industrial warfare. Our government will encourage military-industrial complexes in the Asterionese fashion. It may be uninspiring but freedom requires a price to be paid in coal and steel. Only defeat can be paid with blood alone."

ZES_national_university:0 "Universidade di Nasional"
ZES_national_university_desc:0 "Liberation is a fight that also needs to be fought on the intellectual level. Our military and cooperatives both need new methods and ideas while it is paramount to teach Kásans how to free themselves in their daily lives. We will build a new university in Seguro and offer grants to gifted citizens to come and study there."

ZES_talk_to_workers:0 "Fale Com os Trabadjadóres"
ZES_talk_to_workers_desc:0 "For a long time, Kása has remained somewhat timid in its dealings with labour unions. Yet, it is a perfect form of citizen empowerment against greedy elites and a worthy form of association. Our government will approach the various unions to secure their support and cooperation and provide help where it can."

ZES_encourage_intellectualism:0 "Encourage Intellectualism"
ZES_encourage_intellectualism_desc:0 "Kása has always been held back by a strange focus on physical labour as the sole meaning of work. Though some is due to our difficult conditions, it is also the scar left by Colthaginian slavery. If we are to truly free ourselves, we need to free our own minds and not be humble in the face of intellectual pursuit."

ZES_new_worker:0 "Nóbu Trabadjadór"
ZES_new_worker_desc:0 "Labour and toil. The daily pursuit of a slave. Even in freedom, we have been forced to endlessly toil to build by ourselves what was denied to us. And after that, capitalism and industrialization brought new forms of hardship. But not anymore. As union membership soars and both wages and working conditions improves, the meaning of labour is changing."

ZES_expand_batallions:0 "Expand the Worker Battalions"
ZES_expand_batallions_desc:0 "Workers surprised us by arming themselves and forming their own militias. It has proven to be a very fruitful partnership between them and the Free State. With a foundation proven to be so sturdy, we ought to expand on it and provide them with more resources to expand and professionalize their military training."

ZES_tyranny_gryphus:0 "The Western Company"
ZES_tyranny_gryphus_desc:0 "West of Kása lies Gryphus. Home of some of our most wretched enemies and stolen home of our brothers and sisters in arms, the Gryphussians. Since the early days of our life in Griffonia, we have had to beat back the assaults of the knights of Opinicus in war and those of the Gryps-Süd GmbH in peace. This ends now."

ZES_protect_native_culture:0 "Protect the Native Culture"
ZES_protect_native_culture_desc:0 "Since the Griffonian Empire subjugated the eastern side of the Evi Valley, the knights of Opinicus and the Gryps-Süd GmbH fought hard to force new cultures and practices on the natives. The local Gryphus culture will be protected by a new law and the displaced griffons will be given their ancestral lands back."

ZES_break_company_and_knights:0 "Riaportu Trial"
ZES_break_company_and_knights_desc:0 "The Free Town of Gryphus. Few names in Griffonia were as meaningless as this one. Through greed and bigotry, the knights and merchants enslaved a whole people in all but name. Public inquiry will see them and those who helped carry out their orders put to justice."

ZES_gru_core:0 "Bountiful Estuary"
ZES_gru_core_desc:0 "With the beginning of degriffonianization and the trials, we have righted many wrongs that plagued Gryphus but there is more to do, much more. The twisted form of colonial government of the region impoverished a place that by all accounts is fertile and full of potential. It is time to bring"

ZES_tyranny_wittenland:0 "The Northern Kingdom"
ZES_tyranny_wittenland_desc:0 "Wittenland. The Unicorn kingdom. Our ancestors united with many remnants of the old High Kingdom, abandoned to pirates, vikingars and griffon knights by their overlords. Queen White Star did try to stir it away from its old ways but her rule is over. With this last glimmer of Wittenlandic hope gone, it is time to strike and to finally write the last verse of the Wittenlandic saga. Down with the High Kings!"

ZES_liberated_society:0 "Break the Old Society"
ZES_liberated_society_desc:0 "Feudalism and aristocracy, such euphemisms for slavery and oppression. Throughout its history and despite their newfound clothes, Wittenlandic society was mired with them. Let us abolish all titles, all privileges and servitude. Let's burn the old law books and redistribute the wealth and land. Until it is done, there will be no peace."

ZES_equal_magic:0 "Mage-Liberators"
ZES_equal_magic_desc:0 "The mages of Wittenland have caused much harm to their own countryponies and to us. Whether they served the old regime of compromised themselves with the Barradian Pentarchy. Though, not all of them. With the help of the stalwart mage, Obsidian Shine, we shall reorganise those worthy mages into proper armed forces or integrate them within society without privileges nor nepotism."

ZES_refugee_administrators:0 "Reunited Families"
ZES_refugee_administrators_desc:0 "Barrad committed many crimes and it is easy to lose sight of what it caused to many Wittenlandic ponies, breaking families apart. Now that we all stand under one banner, let us get to work to reunite families, heal the pain of the Xatisa and forge strong and lasting bonds between the liberated people and their diaspora."

ZES_wit_core:0 "Enchanting Peaks"
ZES_wit_core_desc:0 "Freed from decayed traditions, serfdom and the ills of magocracy, Wittenland feels reborn. No longer do these lands toil for the benefits of some, only because they were lucky enough to be born with a horn and a silver spoon in their mouth. There is magic again amongst the peaks of the Wittenlandic mountains. The magic of friendship."

ZES_tyranny_nimbusia:0 "The Eastern Warriors"
ZES_tyranny_nimbusia_desc:0 "Nimbusia. The martial democracy. Was there ever a lie so blatant written in a history book? Is it enough to kill one bloodthirsty emperor to be absolved of morality and slavery? The Nimbusians say yes but we do not buy such lie. We fought off worse with less. If there is any martial democracy in the world, we ought to claim that title. We fight for good. Not for its own sake."

ZES_break_hoplites:0 "Disperse the Cyclone"
ZES_break_hoplites_desc:0 "The Nimbusian martial tradition came at the cost of gruesome and immoral selection. No wonder that after being faced with such abuse, they keep perpetuating such a criminal regime. The Trial of the Cyclone will be disbanded."

ZES_wine_hills:0 "Rebuild the Wineries"
ZES_wine_hills_desc:0 "Nimbusia was a land of wineries and farm estates. Yet, their crops and drinks had a bitter taste to those few who worked the land with no rights. With the helots freed, it is only fair that the reconstruction and land redistribution benefits them of all ponies. Soon, all of Kása shall be able to drink Nimbusian vintages without any worries about the ethics of its production."

ZES_nim_core:0 "Verdant Hills"
ZES_nim_core_desc:0 "Up north, on the coast of Nimbusia, one of the oldest power in eastern Griffonia enforced a grim idea, that of democracy and freedom being a privilege reserved to those who endured and perpetrated a brutal form of militarism. But truth always triumphs, even against the oldest lies. Now, the people sings again in Nimbusia for they can enjoy true freedom and true democracy."

ZES_free_world:0 "Mundu Livri"
ZES_free_world_desc:0 "Just a century ago, it felt as if the world was forced to live under the yoke of the Griffonian Emperor, with oppression and servitude as the orders of the day. So certain was the march of history. But things can change. History can be readjusted. The future shall belong to the downtrodden, the poor. Kása shall be a beacon to all who strive to make this world to all who fight against the wicked."

###Army (new tree)###
ZES_military_macavia_1:0 "Shipments Across The Sea"
ZES_military_macavia_1_desc:0 "Kása's military has always been reliant on Macawian aid, and the harpies have always been willing to give us what we need. In a world growing more dangerous by the day, we should appeal once again for aid."

ZES_military_macavia_2:0 "Deals with Macawian Arms Industries"
ZES_military_macavia_2_desc:0 "There's many arms manufacturers in Macawia, and some of them have expressed interest in opening up industries in Kása. They are amenable to the idea of putting these factories at Kása's disposal as well, and all they need is our signature."

ZES_military_macavia_3:0 "Heavy Arms Purchases"
ZES_military_macavia_3_desc:0 "Merely rifles will not suffice nowadays, and if we are to keep defending ourselves effectively, we must acquire the weapons of modern warfare."

ZES_military_own_1:0 "Fund Military-Industrial Complex"
ZES_military_own_1_desc:0 "Macawia's aid has been a blessing, but we have long since outgrown the need to fully rely on their backing. While our industry is fledgling, we nevertheless need to reorient ourselves towards becoming self-sufficient. One day Macawia might not be there for us, after all. "

ZES_military_own_2:0 "Invest In New Armories"
ZES_military_own_2_desc:0 "If we are to take charge of our own fate, we must expand our armories far beyond their current state. If we think long term, and make sure to keep expanding, Kása may well be truly self-sufficient in the end."

ZES_military_own_3:0 "Improved Production Methods"
ZES_military_own_3_desc:0 "We cannot be satisfied with "adequate" when it comes to our military equipment. A missing hammer can delay a building project, but a missing cannon can change the course of a battle. Streamlining our production methods will be imperative if we hope to be able to equip our army ourselves."

ZES_our_gun:0 "Projektu Bóka Bedju"
ZES_our_gun_desc:0 "Kása is not Macawia, and the weapons that are right for the latter need not be right for the former. As we grow as a nation, we should be developing weapons fit for Kása, with all that that entails."

ZES_military_GBP_1:0 "Organise The Defence Force Of Kása"
ZES_military_GBP_1_desc:0 "Kása's military has one purpose only, to make sure that whoever comes to our lands to do us harm is contested every inch of the way, and that if - gods forbid - Kása should fall the price will be high enough to not be worth it."

ZES_military_GBP_2:0 "Trench Fortifications"
ZES_military_GBP_2_desc:0 "As our enemies come, they shall meet a spiderweb of trenches, pill-boxes and foxholes, with tunnels criss-crossing the earth beneath the hills and forests and with defensive line after defensive line blocking their path."

ZES_military_GBP_3:0 "Improved Frontline Communications"
ZES_military_GBP_3_desc:0 "Without reconnaissance and communications we are blind, and we need to make sure that even if our enemies are the ones attacking, we are the ones who seize the initiative."

ZES_military_GBP_4:0 "Keep The Pace With Others"
ZES_military_GBP_4_desc:0 "We won't survive if we fall behind in the global arms race. New weapons can make the difference between subjugation and freedom, and we need to make sure to develop the best weapons possible for our soldiers."

ZES_military_GBP_5:0 "Kriansas di Pá"
ZES_military_GBP_5_desc:0 "When awaiting orders, dig. When setting up camp, dig. When on the defensive, dig. The shovel is a weapon as much as the gun, and if our soldiers are as well trained in its use, they will be all the better prepared for the challenges that await."

ZES_military_SF_1:0 "Proclaim The Army Of Kása"
ZES_military_SF_1_desc:0 "As Akeeku did when he took up arms against the slavers, Kása stands ready to go to war is that is what it takes to preserve her values and to contest tyrants. We will not meekly sit and wait for them to attack, not if we can strike first and with overwhelming force."

ZES_military_SF_2:0 "Advanced Training In Ballistics"
ZES_military_SF_2_desc:0 "The cannon has become a more and more vital part of modern warfare. If we make sure our soldiers truly master it, we will be able to punch above our weight class. It is a departure from Kása's traditional methods of fighting, but it is the way of the future."

ZES_military_SF_3:0 "Observer-Artillery Communication"
ZES_military_SF_3_desc:0 "If our artillery is to strike true, we must make sure that our observers and our batteries can stay in constant contact. Laying down telephone wires on a battlefield is an art in and of itself, and one that deserves to be taken seriously."

ZES_military_SF_4:0 "Only The Finest Equipment"
ZES_military_SF_4_desc:0 "As we unleash Tartarus upon our enemies, we must do so with the finest possible weapons. For all their size and noise, artillery guns are precision instruments as much as sledgehammers, and second-rate won't be acceptable."

ZES_military_SF_5:0 "Kriansas di Arma di Fogu"
ZES_military_SF_5_desc:0 "The cannon is more than just a weapon. Like Akeeku's spear symbolizes the determination to be free, the cannon will symbolise Kása's strength. We make the very skies ring with the thunderous roar of artillery, unleashing the rage and hatred of hundreds of years of suffering on all who would dare to bring fetters to our people again."

ZES_military_coop_1:0 "Expand Macawian Military Cooperation"
ZES_military_coop_1_desc:0 "We need to take an active role in our cooperation with Macawia, aiming towards becoming equals instead of merely students. Over time, Macawia will be able to learn from us as well."

ZES_military_coop_2:0 "Invite Macawian Officers"
ZES_military_coop_2_desc:0 "Macawia's officers have much to teach us, and their experience can be leveraged for Kása's benefit. Inviting a cadre of Macawian officers over to act as the enemy commanders of a great invasion of Kása will help us to shore up the nation's defences all the more."

ZES_military_coop_3:0 "Send Our Officers Abroad"
ZES_military_coop_3_desc:0 "The Macawian military academy has offered to take on our most promising officers, creating a stable exchange program that would let us combine our own experiences with theirs, improving our offensive capabilities."

ZES_military_coop_4:0 "Grandi Fórsa"
ZES_military_coop_4_desc:0 "When Akeeku rose and fought, there was no place for those who wanted to stay back. Everyone fought, or everyone would fall. This fundamental truth has not changed since then. If war comes all of Kása fights, or all of Kása falls."

ZES_military_coop_5:0 "Advanced Training Methods"
ZES_military_coop_5_desc:0 "Kása has grown, and we are now numerous enough that we can afford excellence. Superior training and equipment can make each Kásan soldier fight for two, and the grim mathematics of war demands that each fallen soldier must have done as much as possible."

ZES_military_coop_6:0 "Commanders At The Frontline"
ZES_military_coop_6_desc:0 "It has been suggested that instead of keeping our commanders far from the frontline, we should keep them right at it. Every second of delay can be deadly, and if our commanders are right among their soldiers, they will be able to organize them all the better."

ZES_military_coop_7:0 "Reserve Battalions"
ZES_military_coop_7_desc:0 "Single battles rarely decide the outcome of a war, and we need to keep this in mind. Keeping reserves at high alert at all times will allow us to respond to any sudden changes on the battlefield, denying defeat wherever it draws near."

ZES_military_coop_legion:0 "Expand The Ramui di Stranjerus"
ZES_military_coop_legion_desc:0 "The Foreign Legion has served Kása well, and though we are developing our own armed forces more and more, the Legion is still there and still appreciated for their contributions to our security. The time has come to expand them, making them fit for the modern era."

ZES_military_1:0 "Universidade di Difese Nasional"
ZES_military_1_desc:0 "War is a complex business, where equipment and zeal can only take you so far. We have to treat war as just as much a matter of scholarly research as any topic, and make sure to study its every facet. Thankfully, Field Marshal Lobu has already drafted up a proposal for this, and all that is needed is the First Commander's signature." 

ZES_military_2:0 "Formalise Hill Warfare Doctrine"
ZES_military_2_desc:0 "Kása's terrain shielded us from the very beginning, with the hills giving us plenty of places to slip away when the tide turned against us and to suddenly appear when we saw a moment. In some places, this knowledge has become a matter of family legacies and honored traditions, and we should make sure to unify these doctrines. "

ZES_military_3:0 "Formalise Mobilisation Procedures"
ZES_military_3_desc:0 "If war comes, we must rally our forces fast. Kása is too small for us to have much time, and by the time the enemy crosses the mountains, it can already be too late. Our nation must be like a coiled steel spring, ready to be unleashed at a moment's notice, otherwise we may not get a second chance."

##Army Áltu Kexa

ZES_altu_mili_1:0 "Preparing the Armed Forces"
ZES_altu_mili_1_desc:0 "The war of liberation requires soldiers, material and tactical superiority. For now, our militias can only do so much and we continue to rely on Macawian support through the Ramui di Stranjerus. It is time for a buildup!"

ZES_altu_mili_4:0 "Refine Our Doctrine"
ZES_altu_mili_4_desc:0 "Irregular warfare and impromptu tactical genius from commanders like the famed Sinora brought us to victory but was has changed. In this era of industrial warfare, we will have to find new ways to triumph with our limited resources. Innovation will be key."

ZES_altu_mili_5:0 "Great Reorganization"
ZES_altu_mili_5_desc:0 "To transition from old and inadequate system will take great efforts. However, it will also be the occasion to let the many ideas cooking up in the minds of our soldiers and citizens finally see the light of day. Let us call for officer meetings."

ZES_altu_mili_6:0 "Proclaim Kása Guarda di Nasional"
ZES_altu_mili_6_desc:0 "The time has come! Our military reforms have concluded and a new Kásan army shall rise from the ashes! Come now followers of the liberation, let us put to the torch all oppressors of the world! Kása é nossa!"

ZES_altu_mili_7:0 "Universidade di Difese Nasional"
ZES_altu_mili_7_desc:0 "Now that the Kásan army is up to the specifications of Áltu, we can establish a new school to teach our military doctrine to all aspiring new officers and recruits. So that all may be highly educated in the ways of liberation... and military tactics of course."

ZES_altu_mili_1_1:0 "Hold Together the Current System"
ZES_altu_mili_1_1_desc:0 "The current network of militias in the Kásan army is unfit to fight the liberations that Áltu has planned. But, we can put in effort to ensure that they are up to snuff for the coming conflicts. Otherwise, we will have to disband them."

ZES_altu_mili_1_2:0 "Call Upon More Local Militias"
ZES_altu_mili_1_2_desc:0 "The military buildup is a long process and we need troops now. Let us mobilize a greater number of our local militias. We will have to hope that the local councils can cope with this burden while we continue to prepare a more sustainable system."

ZES_altu_mili_1_3:0 "Kásan Citizens, Macawian Training"
ZES_altu_mili_1_3_desc:0 "We need professional troops and we need them now. Let us offer a deal to the Macawians. We shall send Kásans to go through the Ramui di Stranjerus training regimen and pay for the difference. This way, we will free up infrastructure and equipment for training that we could better use elsewhere."

ZES_altu_mili_1_4:0 "Establish Act No. 46"
ZES_altu_mili_1_4_desc:0 "The militia system proved to be a great way to be able to muster forces in a hurry. However, the system still has many flaws like the haphazard quality of troops and training. We will draft Act number 46 to institute a reserve corps for the Guarda di nasional. This way, we will combine the benefits of our professional force and the militias without racking up military spending."

ZES_altu_mili_2_1:0 "The Great Rearmament"
ZES_altu_mili_2_1_desc:0 "The Asterionese innovated in the alliance between the private military sector and the military with civilian oversight. It may be a productive venue to secure more weapons and ammunitions for our war effort. There also many other ways we can gather equipment without directly and massively expanding our industrial sector with all the costs associated with it. Let's study all of them."

ZES_altu_mili_2_2:0 "Fund Military-Industrial Complex"
ZES_altu_mili_2_2_desc:0 "To heavily invest in military industry will require to set aside a large part of our military budget. It will take time and effort to secure funding and still maintain some form of budgetary balance. However, it will be worth it in the end. Let's set up a commission to study the matter!"

ZES_altu_mili_2_3:0 "Deals with Macawian Arms Industries"
ZES_altu_mili_2_3_desc:0 "Macawia, our old partner, has a thriving industrial sector, one that could quickly and reliably provide us with military equipment. It may have the added benefit of endearing the Macawian private sector to our cause despite our economic and political agenda."

ZES_altu_mili_2_4:0 "Help From Our Friends"
ZES_altu_mili_2_4_desc:0 "Our war of liberation is more than a just cause, though we may think that it's all that matters. We can make the case to friendly powers that our fight will benefit them in many ways and in the case of Macawia, reduce our reliance on their economic and military aid and so relieve their budget. Now if only, they had a quick and non-committal way to help us..."

ZES_altu_mili_3_1:0 "Macawian Military Cooperation"
ZES_altu_mili_3_1_desc:0 "Ever since First Commander Kexa took office, many in the administration pestered her about increasing military cooperation as a great way to facilitate her foreign policy agenda. Chief among them was the diplomat Silera Meru. Perhaps it is time to hear them out, even if the spirit of Áltu's military plans are about reducing reliance on Macawia."

ZES_altu_mili_3_2:0 "The Spirit of Defense!"
ZES_altu_mili_3_2_desc:0 "The Macawians are quite vocal about their desire to help further the cause of liberation throughout the world. Yet, they get queasy about the risk of escalation in eastern Griffonia. We will display our commitment and efforts to build up Kása as an impregnable fortress to secure more funding and help."

ZES_altu_mili_3_3:0 "The Spirit of Liberation!"
ZES_altu_mili_3_3_desc:0 "The Macawians love nothing more than the ability to say that they contribute to world liberation. While we know they mean well, they can be a bit superficial in how some of them treat it as a hobby. We will sway them by showcasing the most glamourous and heartwarming aspects of our cause to secure more funding and help."

ZES_altu_mili_3_4:0 "Ramui di Stranjerus"
ZES_altu_mili_3_4_desc:0 "For a long time, the Ramui di Stranjerus has been the backbone of our military. It can still have a place among the Guarda di Nasional even if its role will be one of support rather than that of a spearhead. After all, many exiles are willing to come and fight under our banner. We will just need to nudge control away from São Penário and to Seguro."

ZES_altu_mili_4_1:0 "New Officer Core"
ZES_altu_mili_4_1_desc:0 "Our military staff is many thing: dedicated, loyal and upstanding. What it is less is professional or large. We need new leaders to command our expanding army. Soldiers fit for a professional army force rather than militia leaders and foreign adventurers."

ZES_altu_mili_4_2:0 "Instill Discipline in the Ranks"
ZES_altu_mili_4_2_desc:0 "The militias, for all their motivation and heart, were still an unruly bunch, more apt for irregular warfare than modern and symmetrical war. Sadly, most of our recruits still come from old militia volunteers. We ought to review our training regimen and make sure that they learn discipline and a certain esprit de corps."

ZES_altu_mili_4_3:0 "Copy Some Ideas"
ZES_altu_mili_4_3_desc:0 "We do not need to build all of our military doctrine from the ground up when so many nations in Griffonia and beyond honed the art of war for years and decades. Fortunately, we have some agents that are rather good at extracting things from hostile nations. The Skapatoria agents will just need to bring back ideas rather than refugees for once."

ZES_altu_mili_4_4:0 "The Fervor of Freedom"
ZES_altu_mili_4_4_desc:0 "It is easy to explain militia members what they fight for. However, it is less obvious for a professional soldier to whom the idea of defending their homes gets more abstract as time goes by and not all follow politics. Let us prepare documentation and medias to explain to them what our cause is about and instill some fervor in their hearts."

ZES_altu_mili_5_1:0 "Built Upon Strength Of Our People"
ZES_altu_mili_5_1_desc:0 "A professional army cannot rely on local mustering and sense of duty to their community. To base an army on a large professional volunteer force, we will need a whole recruitment infrastructure able to convince more than just the politically engaged few. We will also need to prepare the set up of new regiments to achieve some degree of uniformization between troops."

ZES_altu_mili_5_2:0 "Advanced Training Methods"
ZES_altu_mili_5_2_desc:0 "A professional training regimen cannot just be a full-time version of those used by the militias. Rather, a modern and professional army ought to be prepared to act in various specialized roles and still be able to fight in a cohesive fashion. To achieve that, we will need to design specialized training regimen and a proper method to assign soldiers to the role in which they can excel in."

ZES_altu_mili_5_3:0 "Lay Fire Upon Our Enemies"
ZES_altu_mili_5_3_desc:0 "Modern warfare needs guns of the larger kind but it's not enough to simply produce more and bigger cannons. One needs to know how to use them more effectively, lest we might as well fire money at our enemies. Let us call on colonel Wojtek. He has some expertise and ideas he has been dying to share with us."

ZES_altu_mili_5_4:0 "Dedicated Support Units"
ZES_altu_mili_5_4_desc:0 "By designating specialized support units created out of veteran corps of the Skapatoria Programa, we can augment our military with the best of the best when it comes to asymmetric warfare and tactics. These units will give us the edge when it comes to battling against the larger armies of the tyrant powers."

ZES_altu_mili_6_1:0 "Projektu Bóka Bedju"
ZES_altu_mili_6_1_desc:0 "Production and training are paramount to ensure the material fitness of our army. However, all weapons we can use and produce have been designed years if not decades in the past. Scientists and industrials will provide us with better projects in time but there are ways to speed up the process. A little concerted effort and extra funding now can make us gain years."

ZES_altu_mili_6_2:0 "Arm Our Soldiers With Best Rifles"
ZES_altu_mili_6_2_desc:0 "Each soldier can only be as effective as his personal abilities and weapons allow him to be. Training can only be improved on so much but there is no end to how much you can improve on a gun. However, it takes time and funding to develop them. Let us take time to set up a specification file to send to our engineers to speed up the next steps of the process."

ZES_altu_mili_6_3:0 "Shovels For Everyone"
ZES_altu_mili_6_3_desc:0 "Support equipment is probably among the least glamorous part of a soldier's toolbox but it is no less vital. For now much of our equipment are either variants of civilian tools or imported from Macawia with Harpy morphology in mind. Let us draft specifications for tools fit for our diverse force so we can finally hear less stories about how hard it is to hold those shovels with hooves."

ZES_altu_mili_6_4:0 "Advanced Ballistic Research"
ZES_altu_mili_6_4_desc:0 "Cannons are some of the most advanced weapons we can reliably produce, use and maintain without major changes. The situation may change of course but it is safer to assume that no miracle will befall us. Therefore, it would be wise to invest in better ballistic research so we can get our hooves on some bigger cannons sooner than later."

## Navy-Air Force

ZES_navy_1:0 "Department Of Sea And Air Operations"
ZES_navy_1_desc:0 "The sea is vital to us. Without it, we have no access to Macawian aid. It is therefore instrumental that we make revisions to the way we view the sea; times have changed since our founding, and so must we."

ZES_navy_fib_1:0 "Macawian Way"
ZES_navy_fib_1_desc:0 "If we follow in the footsteps of the bigger and better Macawian navy, then they will be best placed to advise and assist us. Is there really even a choice?"

ZES_navy_fib_2:0 "Cover For Our Fleet"
ZES_navy_fib_2_desc:0 "Battleships are all well and good, but they can be sunk. Extra investment into ship screening will largely mitigate this issue."

ZES_navy_fib_3:0 "To Support Battleships"
ZES_navy_fib_3_desc:0 "While they are undoubtedly the backbone of our fleet, our battleships cannot do everything by themselves, nor is it exactly cost effective to do so. We should invest in lighter ships to make our battlegroups more flexible."

ZES_navy_fib_4:0 "Further Development Of Cruisers"
ZES_navy_fib_4_desc:0 "Cruisers complement battleships well. They are faster, cheaper, and undeniably effective at providing support as a compromise between line ship and screen."

ZES_navy_fib_6:0 "Study Macawian Projects"
ZES_navy_fib_6_desc:0 "Macawia's ships are floating behemoths. They are leagues above our own in durability and firepower. If studied, they could provide us with insights on how best to protect our own ships."

ZES_navy_fib_5:0 "Capital Ships Designs"
ZES_navy_fib_5_desc:0 "Battleships are heavy investments. Therefore, we want to make sure the investment is worth it. We must ensure we always have the most modern battleship designs"

ZES_navy_fib_8:0 "Floating Steel"
ZES_navy_fib_8_desc:0 "We will build ourselves a fleet to rival that of even the old Griffonian Empire. Every fleet has had humble beginnings. Ours will be no different."

ZES_navy_ti_1:0 "To Match Our Size"
ZES_navy_ti_1_desc:0 "As ideal as it would be to follow in Macawia's footsteps, we must accept reality; we are not an industrially competitive nation. We should aim for what we can afford, whether that path is to be walked on our own or not."

ZES_navy_ti_2:0 "Workhorse Of The Navy"
ZES_navy_ti_2_desc:0 "No matter what your fleet looks like, destroyers are essential. Without them, we might as well be sending our folk to their deaths. We should therefore invest in making our destroyers bigger and better."

ZES_navy_ti_3:0 "Silent Wolves"
ZES_navy_ti_3_desc:0 "What cannot be seen, cannot be beaten. Experimenting with submarines will give us the power to deal with larger and stronger naval powers while conserving our own strength."

ZES_navy_ti_4:0 "Death From The Depths"
ZES_navy_ti_4_desc:0 "Submarines are good and all, but they have their weaknesses. We should ensure that our submarines are capable of extended periods of operation underwater to ensure they can perform their job better."

ZES_navy_ti_5:0 "Cruiser Projects"
ZES_navy_ti_5_desc:0 "We must have some form of a competitive naval presence above the waves too. Battleships are simply out of our price range. but the comparative mobility, cost effectiveness, and ease to build of cruisers makes them a perfect counterpart to our navy"

ZES_navy_ti_6:0 "To Find The Enemy"
ZES_navy_ti_6_desc:0 "If we are to effective isolate and destroy vulnerable hostile ships, then we must know where they are. Preparing seaplane catapults to provide effective launching is a good step towards this."

ZES_navy_ti_8:0 "Underwater Armada"
ZES_navy_ti_8_desc:0 "We are death beneath the waves. Our armada will ensure the safety of Kása's shores. They will not see their doom coming."

ZES_air_1:0 "Prepare Land For Airstrips"
ZES_air_1_desc:0 "We need places to launch planes from. Therefore, we shall have to make that land available."

ZES_air_2:0 "Expand Pilots' Training"
ZES_air_2_desc:0 "Planes are dangerous things to the untrained, even more so than perhaps any other vehicle in existance. We must make sure that our pilots are trained for every possible scenario, so that they are ready for anything."

ZES_air_3:0 "To Help Our Soldiers"
ZES_air_3_desc:0 "The war in the air is undoubtedly important, but if we just hold the sky for the sake of holding the sky, then we will have minimal benefit from that advantage. We should therefore begin work on planes that can support our ground forces."

ZES_air_4:0 "To Rule The Skies"
ZES_air_4_desc:0 "Air support, in whatever form it may be, is good, but without adequate fighter protection, it might as well be worthless. We should focus our efforts on developing new fighter designs to dominate the air."

ZES_air_5:0 "To Sink Enemy Ships"
ZES_air_5_desc:0 "Planes are fast, mobile, and dangerous. Ships are less so. Producing airplanes specifically designed to hunt and destroy enemy ships will give our fleets a decisive advantage."

ZES_air_6:0 "Focus On Land Support"
ZES_air_6_desc:0 "The sea is important, but even more so is our home. We should look inwards to protect what we can; our immediate threats are always going to be our neighbours, after all."

ZES_air_7:0 "Support Naval Operations"
ZES_air_7_desc:0 "If Kása is going to be attacked, it is almost certain to come from the sea. It is thus natural that the air force should work in conjunction with the navy, to give us a proper chance against a seaborn invasion."

ZES_air_8:0 "Flókus Di Nevi"
ZES_air_8_desc:0 "Our paratroopers will descend from the skies like the snow with their parachutes painting the air with dots of white. They will claim them in a harsh, icy grip as uncompromising as the winter snow"

ZES_air_9:0 "Planes Deals"
ZES_air_9_desc:0 "Supplying private aircraft firms with our blueprints may be risky, but it is essential if we want to have an airforce at all. It would take too long to build it on our own backs, and so we must look to outside help."

ZES_air_10:0 "To Know Where They Are"
ZES_air_10_desc:0 "The invention of radar has quite a few military applications. We should explore this new technology and exploit it for every advantage it can give us."

ZES_navy_dock_1:0 "Build Great Harbor Of Seguro"
ZES_navy_dock_1_desc:0 "If we want to fufill our naval ambitions, we will need to have the infrastructure to do so. Seguro is the perfect spot to launch such ambitions from; let Seguro become one of the greatest ports in the world!"

ZES_navy_dock_2:0 "Dig The Dry Docks"
ZES_navy_dock_2_desc:0 "Drydocks will allow nature to assist in the creation of our fleets. Now that the harbour itself is prepared, we should finish the infrastructure needed to begin the construction of our navy"

ZES_navy_marines_1:0 "Leões Marinhos"
ZES_navy_marines_1_desc:0 "Perhaps the most important part of our navy is the marine corps. We will train a regiment of marines to be the pride of our nation, so that the rest may look to these brave warriors as examples"

ZES_navy_marines_2:0 "Expand Marines Training"
ZES_navy_marines_2_desc:0 "Our marines face many perils ahead of them. It is not inconceivable to think that they might be deployed in all manner of terrain and circumstance. They should, then, be prepared for anything."

### Pre-Election Events ###
kasa.1.t:0 "The Last Convention"
kasa.1.d:0 "As delegates of the Advisory Council began to gather for the great meeting, there was a buzz of excitement in the air. All members of the council eagerly awaited Mansu Erba's 1007 yearly address, as she always had wise words on where their nation should proceed. Every one of them there knew that many problems still faced Kása, obstacles that none of the nation's founders could have foreseen so many years ago. But despite all these Kása remained strong, 50 years on from its most significant challenge to date, the nation held firm under its Avo, its Grandmother Mansu Erba.\n\nWhen the doors to the chamber opened all creatures in the room turned their heads. There stood Erba with her aid Lûa Ramedi, and as they entered, all rose. Erba shook many hooves as she made her way to the seat at the head of the circle of seats that formed the council—being helped into her wicker chair by Lûa, who then took his seat in the back of the room as he was not technically a member of the council. As this happened, all the other councillors took their seats and began to look endearingly upon their Avo.\n\nMansu Erba cleared her throat and said, "I do here declare, that the 1007 Advisory Council of Kása is open.""
kasa.1.a:0 "Hear hear!"

kasa.2.t:0 "Livru Programa"
kasa.2.d:0 "As the hall again fell to silence awaiting Erba's next remarks, she drew from her satchel a book.\n\n"I have carried this with me since my operation in Austurland in 957. It was given to me by a young pony who I, unfortunately, have not been able to track down in the years since. She had almost nothing to her name except this book and chose to give it to me as thanks. That meant it had to have some value to her. So when I first read it, I was surprised to find it was merely a book about plants found in Wingbardy far away. I had no use for it really, nor did the family I received it from, but I realised something from it; why that young pony and her family held it so dear. It was the idea of learning that is valuable to all beings. And this is a policy I have tried to build on. While I have had the honour to lead you all, we have made great strides in literacy for our nation. Libraries on wheels travel across the land, distributing books and instruction to all the people. Literacy should be a right for all of our citizens, so that we may all work towards a better, more educated future for Kása.""

Lûa looked down, expecting what was coming next.\n\n"This meeting would not be complete without addressing the problem at our northern border, however, for refugees continue to flee from tyranny from that accursed land. We are a nation of free beings dedicated to the idea that all creatures of the world should be free and possess the rights and freedoms we hold dear. With this, we are called to action to protect these ponies who flee from that wicked place called Barrad."\n\nThis drew reactions of support from the room, especially from councillor Yrmthu, an earth pony who herself was born to refugees.\n\nBut these cheers of support did little to lighten Erba's mood. She raised her hoof, quieting the crowd before continuing. "But in answering this call to action, I have failed. I did not act quick enough or decisive enough. For years now, we have been supporting the refugees, and we have made some headway. Many now have jobs in our land and are creating homes and families for themselves. But many more are still struggling. While we may be able to support them, I have failed to find a way to create for them a new home. In this, I ask for your forgiveness."\n\nNow, Yrmthu spoke up: "Avo, no one is perfect. You could not have known what a struggle it would be for the nation to overcome this. My own parents could never have known what this nation would endure when they arrived here. Even I bear some responsibility; I most likely have not done enough either. No one has yet found a perfect solution. Do not be so hard on yourself. We all must stand up and take this problem head-on. For the good of all the citizens of Kása.""

Nodding and smiling, she spoke again.\n\n"Something I am proud that I have been able to do for this nation is moving our economy forward. It has been a team effort from all of us, but I believe I can finally make this declaration: Kása is beginning to enter the modern era step by step, and I for one could not be happier about it."\n\nApplause echoed in the room but was quickly hushed as Mansu gestured her hoof to the back of the chamber.\n\n"And for all that I have someone to thank. Pasarinha." All eyes turned to the zebra at the back of the room, dressed in an old naval uniform and possessing a rough stubble of facial hair, he nodded his head and smiled at the Avo.\n\nWith a groan, Erba rolled her eyes and spoke again. "No! Get up here! We all know you love the spotlight and this is a moment well deserved."\n\nPasarinha chuckled and began to move to the front of the room, he took off his hat and bowed before the rest of the Council, earning applause from all including Erba and Lûa.\n\nErba remarked, "You have done incredible work for this nation. It is thanks to you that the factories of Seguro are running with machinery we only heard tales of not too long ago. Your shipping routes have connected us to the rest of the world, and brought me closer to Kása." Erba chuckled. "Nothing makes me happier than to speak to the citizens on the radio, where all can hear me. I still get some stage fright, but I love it none the less. So thank you very much, Pasarinha."\n\nThe room once again applauded as the former naval captain once again took his seat."

We could not be more grateful for your assistance in these trying times. Thanks as well to the ever-helpful diplomat Silera Medu, who has been working with the ambassador."\n\nErba gestured to a tall, lanky zebra seated next to Tómas, much in contrast to the harpy's sturdier frame.\n\n"You two have done great work in fostering the bond between our two nations," she said before turning to the rest of the Council. "Macawia was our first ally in the battle against tyranny, and we are happy to count them still on that list. The Pact of 907 still stands firm in our minds, and we are proud of the partnership that developed here. We share each other's values, and we fight the same fight. While we struggle against the slavers and despots of this continent, Macawia battles the tyrants of Colthage, and in that struggle, we wish you the best."\n\nWith this, the councillors cheer, and Erba walked to shake the Macawian Ambassador's claw.

kasa.6.d:0 ""While we do everything we can to secure the safety of our citizens within our nation, there are those nearby our borders who wish to do us harm."\n\nThe mood in the room grew grim: Councillor Yrmthu was visibly shaken and was knocking her hoof on the floor, and many other councillors were similarly agitated.\n\n"To our east lies Austurland. Whether we can count them among friends or foes seems to be up to their new Jarl, Ygritte. None of us can say for sure what type of person she is, so we must always be wary of her. To the west is Gryphus. As we speak, they hold a congress at Riaportu plotting their nation's next move. While their current regime is not aligned against us, we are not their friends." Erba's speech gained a rash tone as she continued. "They would gladly wish for our citizens to be subjected to the will of their orders of knights and their ruthless corporations."\n\nThe room stood in shock as a coughing fit wracked Mansu Erba. Regaining her breath, she raised a hoof to decline help, calming herself as she continued in a less rabid tone. "Gryphus does not stand for freedom. We can hope one day they may embrace these ideals, but until then, we must be on guard."\n\nErba took a moment to read the room. Her coughs had rattled the councillors, but she recovered quickly. "To our north lies the 'nation' of Barrad. As discussed previously, the treatment of their people is abominable and has caused many to flee into our nation's arms. I believe our policy should be this: wipe them from the continent one way or another."\n\nCouncillors around the room nodded, their previous scare seemingly forgotten. "Even farther north lies Wittenland and the River Coalition. While many of these nations have embraced the same freedom we have here in Kása, they still hold slavers and tyrants in their midst. We must be wary of a silver tongue backed up by iron chains. Our policy should be to not provoke these nations, as I believe we may one day be friends.

Yrmthu, out of the corner of her eye, noticed Lûa's surprise as well. Whatever came next, it must have been important. The pony met eyes with Pasarinha, who bore a stern look on his face. Gazing upon the faces gathered that day, the mare knew that none of them was ready for what came next.\n\n"I have led this nation for forty years. It is a part of me as much I am a part of it. You all call me the Avo behind my back, I know that, and I have learned to accept it. While thus far, I have talked about change, I now want to speak of things to remain the same. This Council has advised me for all my time as the First Commander. Its faces may have changed, but its spirit is always the same. Democratic elections, limits on terms, they must remain a pillar of Kása for as long as this nation draws breath. Our laws have stayed the same in spirit, and while we have needed to modernize them to the standards of the day, they must always protect those who may not be able to protect themselves and guard the rights and liberties of all our citizens. This spirit must never change."\n\nMansu Erba paused, taking a deep breath. When she resumed, she spoke in a hushed tone.

He stammered out a sentence: "But Avo, we ne—"\n\nErba cut him short. "I am not to be Kása's Avo any longer. My health is waning, and I am growing weaker, both of mind and body. And we are entering an age of problems that I am just not prepared to face. These are the issues of steel and electricity, of modern politics and diplomacy. I can not lead you all any longer. I will work with the government to organize elections for a new First Commander, and then I shall be off to live the rest of my life. I have a husband to get back to, you know."\n\nThe shock finally settled in among those present, any who were not already seated found themselves floored. There were shaking heads and teary eyes. Even the Macawian ambassador showed signs of emotion over this.\n\nSuddenly, Yrmthu rose. "But Mansu!" she exclaimed. "This is so sudden! What if Kása is not ready for this?"\n\nErba, with a smile, said, "Of course Kása is ready. It has been my life's work to prepare it for a moment that I didn't even know would come. I know as well as you all that every First Commander has led Kása for life. But I can not go on any longer. Sometimes, I believe I am the tiredest creature in the world." Mansu Erba sat calmly, and a moment of silence wound through the room. Every creature in attendance realized she was genuine. As Erba saw this, she went on.\n\n"Please, all of you, know that I have made this decision taking everything I can into account. I was elected in a crisis, and I have lived in a crisis since then. I've looked forward to the day where I can wake up in my own home, and live my life as a mother and grandmother without the concerns of a nation weighing on my spirit. Believe me, I value highly the work I have done for this nation, and I am filled with joy to see its success, but I am still a mare, and I have things I would like to do with myself. You all shower me with praise for what I have done, but after today..."\n\nErba closed her eyes and sighed deeply. "After today, please look upon me as just another citizen of this nation. As another creature basking in the liberty and freedom that Kása guarantees to all who live within its borders. I know already many of you shall ask me for advice on how to preserve our nation and its traditions, so I shall address that now. As long as your hearts are interwoven with the spirit of freedom and of liberty, then you do not need the words of any single zebra, for you can simply listen to your own heart, and it shall guide you to a brighter tomorrow. I have already given you my thoughts on the state of our nation today, and if you wish for the last testament of my political life, use that if you wish. But remember, while Kása may be a part of me, it is a part of all of you as well. Do not let any forces cloud that perception in your minds. Kása may be a nation, but it is also a spirit. And that spirit lives within all of us. Thank you."\n\nMansu Erba, the Avo of Kása, rose from her seat. Walking with a vitality she has not possessed in years, she left the Council Hall and entered the passenger seat of a car. Beside her was her husband, and together they drove off to their country home."

## Election events ##

kasa.9.t:0 "The Sinu Scandal"
kasa.9.d:0 "One of the very first electoral debates took place in the old square of Ilha Rosca where, more than a century ago, Kása saw the birth of its democracy. Many had expected it to be relatively calm while the locals were still in the shock of Mansu Erba's demission, but in the end, the debate quickly got heated. The Ilha Roscans had been enraged for days after the press broke the news of a corruption case in Seguro. A councilmare named Sinu was facing charges over an alleged corruption from a Macawian private company seeking to build a branch office in the Kásan capital. However, the case was made complex by Sinu's decision to turn herself in for accepting a large sum of money and gifts from the company, arguing that she had misinterpreted the company's intent. The company, in turn, tried to claim the whole affair had all been a massive misunderstanding caused by internal and translation errors. The involvement of a relatively popular politician and the specifics of the case made the matter hugely controversial in Ilha Rosca as the locals' disdain of corruption is well known.\n\nUpon being asked about the matter, each of the candidates took a stance and explained their position. Lûa Ramedi argued that the law was clear: everyone ought to face charges though lenient ones in the case of Sinu, considering that she turned herself in. Yrmthu pounced on the argument, arguing that leniency would send the wrong message to the private sector and civil servants. She would instead give harsh sentences, especially the company who had no excuse for attempting bribery. Áltu Kexa, in turn, agreed with Yrmthu over the evident foul play at the company's hooves but argued that Sinu acted in good faith and was not at fault. Worse, she considered that it would be criminal to remove a virtuous public servant for a private company's wrongdoing. Pasarinha finally intervened, arguing that there was little point in tearing each other apart over a so-called bribery case being reported by the alleged bribed. Instead, he claimed that it would serve as a lesson for everyone in Kása, and that they ought to forgive both Sinu and the company since there was no harm done."

She lost her seat and cannot campaign for the next ten years. The company involved, for its part, was fined for a significant sum.\n\nThe judge overseeing the case lauded the Kásan public for remaining dignified and trustful of their institutions despite the politicisation of the issue that had occurred during the electoral campaign.

The involved company faced a penalty for a moderate sum of money.\n\nIn his speech, the judge scolded Sinu for letting herself be so naive as to accept gifts from professional contacts in the first place. In response, Sinu solemnly promised to never again engage in such behaviour and publicly apologised for disappointing her constituents. The judge then addressed the public, warning against a lax attitude towards the matter of corruption in Kása. He reminded all that ignorance is the first step towards the decay of harmony.

Corruption and bribery, even from the well-intentioned or well-liked, will weaken the foundation as sure as any slaver or knight of Opinicus. "Justice enforced by mob rule, even if it is well-meaning, is no justice at all." he said.\n\nUpon leaving the court of justice, Sinu supporters jeered at the judge.

kasa.10.t:0 "The Wingalac Strike"
kasa.10.d:0 "The candidates' journey to Seguro went smoothly, but when they arrived at the brand new public square where they would hold the debate, quarrelling citizens met them. It was unclear what the dispute was over, but it died down as the candidates settled in the discussion. One of the angry citizens present during the quarrel spoke up to ask a question. He spoke of the current strike occurring at the Wingalac canned food plant; the workers complained of low pay, lack of safety equipment, and bad hours. They explained that the local manager had his hooves tied in any negotiation because only the Macawian office could implement change in the company's management. For weeks now, the Macawian branch of Wingalac refused to meet the workers in any way.\n\nÁltu Kexa intervened first, happily supporting the strikers for their brave stand against Wingalac. She called upon these foreign managers to leave their greed behind or that perhaps the Kásans would decide to take their well-earned money elsewhere and spend it on other, more respectable products. Pasarinha quickly intervened to denounce Áltu's rhetoric as harmful and argued that the strike ought to used constructively rather than as a political tool. He claimed that the Macawians were overall extremely responsible in their dealings and that Kásans could not expect a fortune as a salary when the average Kásan, rural or urban, often had to make do with less than them. Yrmthu criticized Pasarinha in kind, arguing that it would be absurd to expect of Kásans to be content to live in misery. She could understand that a company's means were limited, sure, but the fact that the management had failed to even meet once with the workers indicated bad faith on its part. The press then turned to Lûa Ramedi, who explained that the workers were right to strike, but that the issue was beyond this particular strike. With the law being unclear on such matters, he argued that significant legislative changes in the labour regulations were necessary along with an overall renegotiation with Macawia in the case of trade. He asked both the strikers and Wingalac to act responsibly, advising Wingalac specifically to talk with the workers before the government decided for them."

The workers resumed their activities after reaching an agreement between labour representatives and the Wingalac managers sent from Macawia to negotiate. The deal included a permanent representation of the worker on the company's board meetings and more executive power being transferred to the Kásan branch to prevent future breakdowns of communication, such as those that brought the workers to strike. Also included in the deal were a small reduction in working hours, the creation of safety guidelines, and a formalisation of the payment method.\n\nDespite being heavily politicised, the strike remained peaceful overall, and while the public supported the movement, none of the candidates directly and publicly lent their support to the workers.\n\nInterviews with the workers showed that the agreement did much to restore trust between the company and the Wingalac management. The press releases of the company in Macawia also boasted about their improved relationship with the workers. They released a statement in the Kásan press expressing hope that the negotiation could serve as inspiration for any future legislative change in Kása."

kasa.48.t:0 "The Bernardo Controversy"
kasa.48.d:0 "This week, a former member of the administration named Carloz Bernardo caused a great deal of upheaval in the press. In his multiple interviews, he aired his grievances against the government by claiming that he was worried about Lûa Ramedi's popularity and likely election. He detailed many instances in which Mansu Erba's government erred and engaged in nepotistic and authoritarian activities. Initially, many took his claims at face value, but as the controversy grew, Bernardo's claims became more farfetched and contradictory. In some instances, he asserted that Ramedi had conspired to force Mansu Erba into retirement in something approaching a coup. In others, it was the former First Commander herself who suppressed political opponents throughout Kása to install her heir into power. Accusations of corruption took an increasingly conspiratorial turn as Bernardo described Ramedi and Erba as being agents of everyone: from the Order of Opinicus to the Nimbusians or even the Colthaginians.\n\nThough the assertions have tarnished his reputation, Ramedi debunked many of the more plausible ones by releasing detailed documentation that proved his innocence and foul play on the part of Bernardo. In the end, Carloz Bernardo declared himself a candidate to the election despite being well past the deadline for filing a candidacy. When confronted about this, Bernardo lashed out, stating that his political opponents changed the electoral process to prevent him from 'saving' Kása. In the end, this last stunt mostly put an end to Bernardo's political adventure and the scandal."

Ramedi happily obliged and gave a long and detailed talk on the duties of the First Commander and the implications of constitutional control of legislative and executive work.\n\nThis conference would have been nothing more than a footnote of the election if not for an exchange reported by a reporter. During the debate section, the professor elaborated on an obscure part of the constitution after a student's question. He was, however, interrupted by Lûa Ramedi, who explained that his response was incorrect. The professor shrugged off the direct intervention by saying in jest, "This is why you only invite politicians to constitutional studies sometimes." Despite the comment, Lûa Ramedi went on, quoting the article of the constitution in question, and even referring both a significant court precedent on the matter and a little bit of history regarding the making of said article. Ramedi was proven correct by a student who provided a constitutional textbook, much to the apparent dismay of the professor."

For all that was said about the importance of it, the innovativeness of the candidate's typical tour and the press coverage, it all felt like a coronation. Lûa Ramedi was the favourite, and he was seen as the best candidate. Not one for outbursts and with a steady hoof as a civil servant, everyone knew that Mansu Erba thought highly of him. Yes, Lûa Ramedi seemed the obvious choice; he would lead Kása, and it would be for the better.\n\nBut to many, there was a sense of disappointment. Was democracy supposed to be about just selecting the most qualified and safe candidate? Wasn't there something cry out about, something to do that was beyond that was reasonable? Sometimes, what was right was not necessarily what made the most budgetary sense. And while it was good to be well-lead, sometimes it was more important for the populace to participate in the matters of state. There was a reason, after all, that Kásans believed in democracy and didn't crown Akeeku as their king, even if he would have made a splendid one.\n\nNo: there was a need to do more. There were more than one good Kásan who also ought to have a say. Yrmthu would give them that voice."

kasa.51.d:0 "The Wingalac Strike that rocked the electoral campaign early on has finally come to a close this week. Despite the demand for a meeting from the strikers, the company's management back in Macawia never visited the factory. They instead raised salaries and cut working hours in an announcement through the local managers. In addition, a translated set of guidelines delineating worker safety used in Macawian factories of Wingalac for workers fluent in Kásan and Wittenlandic was in the works. The announcement satisfied most of the workers, but some protested and continued the strike for better conditions; the remaining strikers were promptly fired.\n\nThe strike was generally peaceful to the end, despite some of the laid-off workers threatening both the management and some former colleagues, whom they considered being 'scabs'. Additional reporting showed that the strike saw little public support following the initial politicisation of the issue.\n\nThe reaction of the Wingalac management to the end of the strike was relatively muted. Some journalists tried to conduct interviews, though few workers were willing to speak. Those who did talk publicly claimed that the situation was getting better, but feared that future strikes would only get harder if nozebra was daring enough to force the management to a sit-down."

kasa.52.t:0 "Undiplomatic Compliments"
kasa.52.d:0 "Today, a small controversy was caused by the release in the press of the interview with the Macawian ambassador. Overall, the interview was hardly problematic, and the ambassador went through various consensual talking points. Eventually, however, he spoke of the mutual benefits that would come from the relationship between Macawia and Kása 'once First Commander Pasarinha is elected'. Pressed on this statement by the journalist, the ambassador walked on his words in full, explaining that he misspoke because he had not gotten enough sleep. He claimed to mean 'once the First Commander is elected', and that because he had just read an article speaking extensively about Pasarinha, he had a slip of the tongue. The ambassador explained that he was reading up on all of the candidates and that the misstatement was only an unfortunate coincidence. Unconvinced by the explanation, the journalist wrote extensively about the awkwardness that followed as the ambassador kept denying he was endorsing Pasarinha in any shape or form.\n\nAfter the publishment of the article, many began to refer to Pasarinha as 'Macawia's candidate', though very few went as far as to claim that Macawia would directly interfere the election in Pasarinha's favour."

kasa.53.d:0 "This week, the Macawian Irmaos company announced a deal with several small Kásan paper mills and printing companies to establish a large factory north of Seguro. The announcement came as a surprise, as Irmaos had officially had failed to reach a similar deal the previous year. Officially, the press communiqué of the company spoke of the incredible opportunities existing in Kása and of the welcoming atmosphere towards foreign investors.\n\nLater in the week, an investigative journalist wrote an article in which he summarised several interviews of employees of Irmaos and those of the domestic companies. Speaking under the condition of anonymity, they painted a less rosy picture than that from the Irmaos representatives. The project, even if it were sound, would create fewer jobs than claimed by the Irmaos company. Several of the anonymous workers also credited Pasarinha's popularity in the election as a determinant factor in the company's decision, though he played no direct part in the process."

Most conversations went from who to support to what would Pasarinha do once in charge, and how would he deal with various matters. However, not everyone saw 'Kása's accountant' as the best choice for First Commander. The more he spoke, the more some people felt the lack of candour in his words and instead, the dryness. Sure, his speeches were logical and appeared professional. But were carefully prepared words and a calm demeanour all that there was to democracy?\n\nAs such, citizens listened or read about Áltu Kexa's speeches in growing frequency. There was a righteous fury in her words, directing the anger at everything that was going wrong in the world. It was not like the news painted a better picture of it all either: who could focus on the fine prints of trade policy when creatures were dying by the thousands in Prywhen or Longsword? When there were still slaves wasting away to fatten their masters in Nimbusia or Colthage? Sitting idly by felt wrong; Kása ought to do something! To some, it seemed as if Pasarinha who spoke so little of it and didn't care.

The strikers returned to work after reaching an agreement with the Wingalac managers sent from Macawia to negotiate. The deal mainly focused on a significant rise in pay for all workers, though the implementation of safety guidelines and reduction of working hours were less substantial.\n\nThe strike intensified after it became a national issue during the electoral campaign. Emboldened by public support, the strikers found numerous ways to ask Wingalac to send a negotiation team. It culminated in a moment of international solidarity with Macawian workers protesting at the company's headquarters. Some see the Wingalac strike as a watershed moment for the Kásan labour movement, and there were rumours of growing calls for unionization in the country.\n\nSome interviews conducted among the workers indicated that the agreement was welcomed and celebrated as a great victory. Back in Macawia, Wingalac did not comment on the strike at its headquarters and dodged questions when pressed by the local press."

This news came as little surprise, previous negotiations to purchasing and expanding local paper mills had yielded no results.\n\nWhat would have been a mere footnote took a turn when leaked information published in the Macawian press detailed the Irmaos company's fears of Yrmthu's victory in the Kásan election as a deciding factor for the cancellation of the plans. Reportedly, even if not elected, her popularity showed that doing business in Kása carried significant risk. Some Macawian board members supposedly went so far as to call her a closeted socialist, a surprising accusation considering the lack of traction that socialist thought had in Kása. This revelation travelled overseas and made it to the headlines in the Kásan press. Some business leaders and captains of industry turned on Yrmthu over her apparent capacity to turn away foreign business. The majority of workers, however, have begun to see Yrmthu's message of decentralization as a step in the right direction."

The locals took control of a worker camp alongside the road and have blocked access to the workers.\n\nAccording to the protestors, the plan would have caused a great deal of damage to their lives as the planned road would go straight through fields and grazing lands. Worse, the project includes only one underpass to allow locals to go from one side to the other despite more than half of the village's agriculture being on the other side of the proposed road. The protesters explained to the press that the whole project was particularly egregious because if the route only deviated a bit to the west, it would go through unused land. The protest was largely supported by Yrmthu, who said that such easily preventable issues would never happen if the government gave local communities additional oversight power over building projects.\n\nSoon after the protest, Seguro sent envoys to negotiate and plan a new route for the road."

It looked as if the wind was finally turning as many members of society, used to having little to no say about it, have now realised that they mattered just as the First Commander. No longer refugees, Skapatoria survivors, or forgotten rural inhabitants, they were all true Kásans.\n\nThis shift wouldn't come by smoothly, however. Some felt that this idealism, while laudable, could happen in ways that would irrevocably hurt the country. After all, had Kása not already stood for those with no voice? The change would sure have come by eventually, so there was no need to rush or be discontented. Kása already did much to alleviate the poor souls from Barrad during the Xatisa years. However, what of the store-owner? What of the average worker in Seguro or Fyrport? What of the forgotten Kásans who wordlessly toiled, prayed, and paid their dues with no complaint? Were they not allowed to have the chance to thrive, simply because they were not the worst off?\n\nThose with these concerns had a need, and they called for an administration that understood their plight. They called for an administration that knew of an important mantra: to give to others, one must be sure that they have enough for themselves. The people called for a leader who could ensure that everyone would be fed and allow Kása to grow and prosper rather than eke through survival. In short, they needed an accountant, a businesscreature; they needed Pasarinha."

The deal includes a reduction in working hours, a formalization of breaks, and the establishment of strong safety guidelines, procedures and equipment.\n\nThe strike intensified after it became a national issue during the electoral campaign. The strike spilt over in Seguro and Ilha Rosca where supporters of the movement engaged in a boycott of the company and protested at the Macawian embassy. In a now emblematic moment, a few foals were caught by a photographer merrily painting a graffiti over Wingalac advertisement in front of a Seguro general shop. While the protest remained peaceful, supporters of the movement threw rotten eggs at one of the Wingalac representatives present for the deal.\n\nPress interviews of workers involved with the strike indicate that the strikers welcomed the deal and celebrated it as a victory. In Macawia, the Wingalac company decried the lack of support from either Macawia or Kásan governments during the negotiations. They also called the episode of the graffiti and the rotten egg as worrying signs of deteriorating Kásan-Macawian relations."

In a speech, the secretary-general of the KBA said that his association didn't take to the streets lightly, but saw the rising popularity of Áltu Kexa as more than just a politician's popularity. They argued that her speeches, though passionate and sincere as they may be, were dripping with a carelessness when it came to due process and the rule of law, if not outright contempt for such concepts. They pleaded for the poet to remind herself, as a poet should know, of the gravitas of the words and their meaning. A successful democracy was impossible without passion for the destitutes of the world. However, it was also a cultural attitude, one that did not treat democratic institutions as obstacles to overcome but as integral and vital parts of the democratic process."

kasa.61.d:0 "Today a striking image made the front page of many newspapers in Kása after a recruitment office for the military became the scene of a party. While Kásans had never been shy about joining those who would protect them from foreign threats, those who lived around the recruitment centres have seen some changes in recent weeks: hundreds of young creatures flocking to enlist themselves or become reservists. Now one office in Seguro has seen such a line of would-be volunteers that they had to leave many creatures hanging at the end of the day. These youngsters decided to wait by organising a party that lasted until the following day. They scattered to bring back food, instruments, and cheap alcohol. While they were certainly showing off the vigour of youth, many regretted it the morning after as the ensuing hangovers made their physical examination significantly harder, if somewhat amusing.\n\nThe journalists visiting the scene asked the partying patriots why they wished to enlist. Most repeated many of the typical reasons, though many also mentioned being inspired by Áltu Kexa. To them, it was as if Kása had grown complacent and was no longer aware of the importance of fighting for one's freedom. They wanted to fight tyranny wherever it was, to become heroes just like Akeeku or the Ebyron heroes, and most importantly, to do their duty as Kásans."

kasa.62.d:0 "For weeks now, the atmosphere in Kása was burning with enthusiasm. Each day, the fiery speech of Áltu Kexa captured the minds of many and animated discussions around the dinner table. There was outrage and a desire to do more, much more. The was the desire to finally roar instead of moping around and listening to the endless chatter.\n\nBut to some, all of this passion and energy did not feel empowering: it was instead dangerous. Áltu Kexa was undoubtedly right in reminding everyone of the evils of tyranny and slavery, but was it the correct way? Not all of the continent was that bad. Indeed, Kása was not alone after all. Some countries in the Riverlands were alright, and there was Asterion. Heck, wasn't that Kemerskai fellow still trying to fight for democracy in those faraway lands? Knowing this, was it so wise to do so much sabre-rattling? They were but a small country, after all.\n\nTo the sceptics, it felt as if there was a need for cooler heads to prevail: someone who knew what they were talking about; someone who would seek other venues than war if there was a way, no matter the difficulties. Yrmthu had her heart in the right place, sure, but she too seemed to place passion over reason. As for Pasarinha, he was... fine? No, they mostly trusted Lûa Ramedi. He had followed Mansu Erba for many years, and when he spoke, he always went into details of every matter. There was neither vagueness nor slogans in his words—only real, actionable ideas."

kasa.11.t:0 "The Boycott"
kasa.11.d:0 "As the candidates made their way to Fyrport, Kása's westernmost port and home to the biggest Gryphussian community in the country, they were immediately met by a controversy that was sure to be the main topic of debate in the public square.\n\nThe controversy revolved around accusations made by Kásan native Gryphussians that many products sold in Gryphussian-owned stores in the city were instead products made and sold by the hated Gryphusische Südkontinent-Gesellschaft. Such allegations are not entirely baseless, as the Gryps-Süd GmbH is well known to use less-than-ethical methods to produce their goods. These accusations have caused protests to break out in front of the stores and raised a call for the boycott of said stores and their products, barely stopping short of direct clashes. Several store owners accused Kásan radicals of needlessly stoking the fire and that the accusation was nothing but slander.\n\nDuring the debate, each candidate made clear their position regarding the matter. Yrmthu was the first to speak, praising the community for taking such a complicated issue into their hooves and claws and doing so in a peaceful fashion. She advised the community to support local products from regional farmers and craftcreatures instead and called for national and regional 'morality testing' regarding the conditions in which products are made. Pasarinha spoke next and advised that this was a perfect example of Kása's need to better and pre-emptively screen companies doing business within its borders. However, he asked for the locals to remain open for dialogue with the store owners to clear any misunderstandings and to integrate them as part of the solution. Áltu Kexa pushed back against Pasarinha, referring the protesters as lovers of freedom. She warned that only constant vigilance as displayed here would prevent the greedy and amoral Gryphussian strand of capitalism from slithering its way into Kása. Lûa Ramedi concluded the exchange by supporting the idea of a boycott as a valid and lawful method of protest but urged the protesters to maintain their choice of peaceful action. He also called for an independent committee to investigate the claims and take legal action against the store owners who violated Kása's ban on slave-made products."

Oh, what she wouldn't give to have been a hippogriff.\n\nShe barely held back from heaving her breakfast when Lûa Ramedi walked up to her.\n\n"A fine day, isn't it?" he asked in greeting. "I'm eager to see Oferclif. It really has been too long since I've set a hoof there." His eyes met Yrmthu's. "It's your hometown, right?"\n\n"Retorno," Yrmthu managed to say before swallowing her nausea. "We call it Retorno—have been for years, but nopony has ever bothered to update the official maps. It wouldn't be a problem if the city council integrated the camps."\n\n"Ah." Lûa nodded sagely. "I'm sure we'll get around to do it in due time. We've talked about it with Avo once. There were so many things about that place that she held close to her heart. However, she always held the principle that first and foremost, Kása ought to care for her citizens and her guests. I'm sure the refugees will agree on this." He smiled. "I certainly do."\n\nYrmuthu groaned. "We've been cared for years now, Lûa. Our Avo cared for us all her life and what good did it do in the end? I'm still here, and so are my parents and everyone else. We're not your guests anymore. We're Kásans just as much as you are. What they all need is a seat at the table, not a representative or a little bit more food allowance." Her eyes glowered as she said, "We want justice. We want the Xatisa to end, and we won't stay on the sideline."\n\nLûa frowned. It was rare for him to do so, and he coldly replied: "You've been part of our government for years now. You know that we didn't have the budget to do anything else but mitigate the damage of the Xatisa. Mansu—"\n\n"I know, Lûa!" Yrmthu exclaimed. "We know! Trust me on this. We've listened to this speech thousands of times: budget constraints. But it's not an issue of budget balance to us, nor should it be for Kása. It is a crisis, a crisis that we can end. And I don't want Mansu Erba to die while it still goes on, nor my parents for that matter."\n\nLûa pondered for a moment but didn't object. In the end, he offered her a slight smile."

kasa.12.d:0 "When the ship bringing the candidate from Fyrport to Oferclif, or Retorno as the Barradians refugees liked to call it, there was a sense of unease among most of them. The town and its massives refugees camps had been the greatest failure of the early days in Mansu Erba's government. It was easy to forget what the Xatisa meant back in Seguro, but when it all made sense when coming here. In this day of clear weather, the Barradian mountain range in the distance was visible, as were the ominous and unnatural clouds looming over it.\n\nWhen the debate started, the very first question from the public was about the recent arrest of a group of paramilitary griffons who sought to cross the border into Barrad and attempt to free it themselves. This sort of thing had happened many times, and Mansu Erba had always condemned it. Now, however, each of the candidates had to explain their position on the matter.\n\nÁltu Kexa, who had no history with Barrad or the Xatisa, spoke first. In a fiery speech, she called the Barradian overlords the worst tyrants of them all and the cruellest abusers of magic. She called for volunteers to be released while advised them to have a bit of patience as she clarified her intention to use military force to put an end to the Barrad crisis, once and for all. Yrmthu, a Barradian native, spoke next. She didn't use a bellicose language but said that the end of the Barradian tragedy was long overdue and that she would not hesitate when it came to the question of Barrad. She called for a conditional release of the volunteers, warning them not to take individual actions as the mages of Barrad were dangerous. There were already too many graves showing that overconfidence was indeed an insidious killer. Lûa Ramedi chastised the volunteers, calling such hasty actions reckless and needlessly risky, for their cause and even for Kása as a whole, as it could mean retaliatory military action from Wittenland as legally, Barrad was still Wittenlandic territory. Pasarinha ended the discussion by saying that he sympathized with the volunteers and called for their release. However, he strongly warned them to reconsider their life choices, as blind vengeance was only destructive. He mentioned how he had found himself while serving in the navy and added that perhaps enlisting in the local militia would be the best way for the youths to find their purpose in life."

As they entered it, a deer protestor heckled them, accusing Yrmthu of prioritizing the liberation of Barrad while his brethren were still dying under the rule of Austurland. Yrmthu spoke to the protestor, pointing that her platform includes the emancipation of Austurland. However, the deer displayed his support for Àltu while accusing Yrmthu of only caring about Wittenlandic creatures. At that point, Yrmthu snapped and told the protestor off. The car ride continued in tense silence, with Yrmthu appearing disheartened until Àltu decided to speak.\n\n"I cannot fathom your attitude, Yrmthu," said Àltu. "You of all of the Council's creatures ought to know what it's like to live under the tyranny. You fled for your lives and yet are content to live here in freedom. It all sounds very egoistic of you. First come, first serve." She shook his head. "What hypocrisy!"\n\n"Don't you dare put words in my mouth or those of my brothers and sisters," Yrmthu said with clenched teeth. "You are not our representative, nor will you ever be! We're not a tool for you to use. What would you even know of tyranny? You can't even begin to understand what we have fled from! We fled from war, and forty years later, we are still recovering from it! Your flippant approach to war will only cause more destruction and displace more creatures." Her tone grew quiet but remained harsh. "What good is freedom if all you can give those creatures afterwards is a pat on the back and excuses while they starve?"\n\nÀltu's eyes hardened. "Isn't that what the slavers themselves say? Oh, at least they have a roof over their head and food on the table," she said mockingly. "They're provided for, unlike the poor in free countries. How wholesome! There ought to be no hierarchy when it comes to suffering, and we need to listen to every grievance. The plight of Austurland is no different from that of Barrad. And when you make distinctions, you will always end up saying that the lives of the thralls of Austurland are worth less than those of the Barradians."\n\n"That's the problem, miss Kexa," Yrmthu replied, maintaining the quiet fury in her words. "You don't really care about their lives. To the creature that lies dying alone in a ditch because of war, freedom matters little. There is more to both it and liberty than speeches and glory." She leaned back into her seat. "So you can tell those voters all they want, but you're not ready for what is to come."\n\nÀltu glared at Yrmthu but held her tongue.

No wonder it had dissuaded many in Austurland to attempt an invasion with such a city to overcome or leave in their back. It was true that Aebbercurnig was not the richest or city, nor the most beautiful but from its wall, you could see Austurland and for the many freed deers living in the cities, such a sight was a constant reminder that the land of their personal Tartarus was still there, still enforcing slavery and pain for so many. The city was not just the home of many refugees brought by the Skapatoria program, it was also proportionally the most common city of origin for those serving under Kása's flag. Here was a city where they understood the meaning of dying for the cause.\n\nWhen the debate began on the public square, many in attendance were legionaries and militiacreatures allowed to participate. Of course, this lead much of the debate to be about military matters such as the role and future of the Kásan Foreign Legion.\n\nPasarinha spoke first and lauded the Legion for its service. He called for an expansion of the legion as a great way to cultivate the military relationship between Macawia and Kása and called the Kásan exemplary for helping to make this great collaboration so successful. Lûa Ramedi followed suit by calling for a continuation of the current situation and expanding both forces in accordance both to the level of threat and to the growth of the country. He argued that the Kásan model worked well and was in no need of radical change. Áltu Kexa criticized them both, emphasizing the need to drastically expand the Kásan military so that it would be able to stand and defend itself without any need for foreign help. Yrmthu, finally, argued that the Legion ought to be integrated into a unified Kásan military to better emphasize the Kásan military independence. However, the regiments of the Foreign Legion should still remain a distinct force to account for all the special ways in which it differed from the Kásan-born units."

Àltu Kexa was quietly pondering while Pasarinha was preparing his pipe when a waiter came to ask them if they wished for anything else. Pasarinha requested "Rum. Macawian, if you have any." As the waiter left, Àltu began to giggle uncontrollably, prompting Pasarinha to stare at her. She asked: "Is there anything about you that doesn't scream your love of Macawia?"\n\n"I'm not sure what your point is, miss Kexa. Macawian rum is objectively one of the best there is."\n\n"You know what I mean. I could write an anaphoric speech about "As the Macawians say" and I'm fairly sure people would think I'm just quoting you. But joking aside, why are you this way? Surely, there must be some pride of Kása in you, some belief that we are capable of doing things just as well as Macawia if not better. So why are you so Tartarus-bent on trying to convince Kása that this is the only way to move forward, asking the Macawians to save us again and again and again?"\n\n"Elegantly put, my dear. I'll humor you. I am indeed proud of being Kásan and I believe that much in our future is bright. However, our means are limited and the Macawians are willing to provide and help. Why would I spit on such a rare windfall? If the Macawians wish to fight our wars, I shan't stop them? So while they do, I'll focus our own money and resources on building up all that we have so that when the inevitable Macawian withdrawal happens, we are able to live and act as a rich and powerful nation."\n\n"And this is why you're naught but an accountant. Kása deserves more. It deserves a national spirit of not relying on charity. It deserves a will to do things themselves. It deserves purpose. Are we to play chess only to talk about the economical ins and outs of the tower piece? Kása needs a legacy of pride and achievements, not one of a good hustle."\n\nPasarinha chuckled and shrugged. "Pride matters little when you're ash in the soil. So I'll be happy to play the part of the ancestor that my descendants will love to complain about.

And yet, despite some of the dust of the Wingalac strike settling, they were still welcomed by a population annoyed by yet another scandal in what had proved to be a sad year for the Kásan capital.\n\nWhile it had always been an open secret that finding proper housing in Seguro was a difficult business as the city seemed to be incapable to do anything but grow at neck breaking pace. And yet, everycreature thought that it wasn't all that bad. And then earlier in the month, a family of seven and several bystanders were killed or injured by the explosion of a cramped house due to a gas leak. After inspection of the local firefighters and investigation by journalists, activists and the police, many reports were produced and it painted a story far worse than many had imagined. Landlords, the now infamous "sleep merchants", had built thousands of unsanitary and shody housing units and were cramming them with poor creatures who had little alternative due to the housing shortage. And on top of that, the average rent for those accommodations barely above those of a slave was nothing short but extorsion. And all of that in the heart of Seguro.\n\nWhen the matter was brought to the public square debate, Lûa Ramedi was the first to speak. Barely concealing his anger, he called for a citywide public enquiry and said that harsh sentences and fines should be given to any of those who had profited from lax enforcement of the housing regulation, up to full expropriation and confiscation of properties that would be refurbished by the state. Yrmthu, in turn, condemned the sleep merchants but considered that it really was a symptom of a larger problem which was the mass emigration from destitute rural communities. Only by supporting ailing townships would the burden of Seguro be eased. Pasarinha for his part called for an increase of the house construction budget and a full reform of the housing code with a new and modernized city plan and firm safety laws. Finally, Áltu Kexa decried the sleep merchants as exploiters no better than slave-owners and called for them to be tried. She then called for a civilisational rejuvenation throughout Kása and called for the masses to look back to the countryside as a place they can live in as their own masters with their own lands."

After a while of wandering, he ended passing by Lûa Ramedi's cabin. The door had been left open and he saw Lûa in the middle of a true puddle of papers. He knew that scene quite well as it had happened countless time back when Lûa was just Mansu Erba's secretary. He was stuck on something and Pasarinha figured he could use a game of chess. Also Lûa was probably most likely to not pick a fight with him. As they were playing, Lûa proved quite adept but it was not surprising, though still within the bounds of his clock. He was making mistakes and taking forever playing. Pasarinha wasn't exactly sure if it was because of him planning every single moves or because whatever he was working on. No matter, he was still doing well. He was making amazing use of the queen to the point of predictability. He chuckled: "You enjoy the queen don't you?"\n\n"It is the most versatile piece in the game. It would be an inefficient choice to not use it to its full potential. Check."\n\nPasarinha then took his pawn, just nearing the edge of the board. In a single move, it would become a queen and put Lûa in checkmate. He looked at it and smirked before turning to Lûa, waiting for him.\n\n"The issue, my friend, is that you only think about the hoof you're given. You have served under and been shaped by Mansu Erba so much that you can't seem to see Kásan politics except as the continuation of her term. You're an heir, much like Yrmthu is even if she doesn't like to hear it. But it's part of what the problem is. If I had been shaped by my past, I would still be a dockhand back in Ilha Rosca. But like this piece here, I worked my way to become more. I became a queen. Do you see what I mean?"\n\n"I do. But I'm afraid you still lose."\n\nPasarinha frowned before Lûa pointed him to the clock which had run out of time, causing him to lose the game as he had failed to actually put down his piece and call checkmate. Lûa smiled.\n\n"That's the issue with you, my dear Pasarinha. You enjoy telling a good story, or rather a lesson about maturity, too much.""

After all the controversies and agitation that they saw throughout the campaign, it was good to see the Kásan historical capital doing well and feeling as lively than ever. It could make one wonder if any of them could really help Kása thrive enough that every city could feel like Ilha Rosca did. But this was no time for quiet pondering. It was time to campaign.\n\nThe debate went quite well and finally centered around the matter of the Skapatoria Program, one of Kása's biggest source of pride. Upon being asked about what they would do regarding it, each candidate was happy to oblige. However, they were also asked about the diplomatic pressure that were done by foreign power regarding it.\n\nPasarinha spoke first and passionately about his own service in the navy and argued that the future of the program would be at sea where much of the slave trade was still occuring. He spoke of the terrible ripple effects of the rebirth of Hauklandish piracy and how pirates from many Griffonian and Zebrican nations had begun to engage in slavery more and more. "No more D'Vash", he concluded. Lûa followed by supporting tying the Skapatoria funding to a percentage of the state income rather than a fixed budget. He also vowed to push back against any pressure and instead pressure any foreign partners to abolish slavery on their own before any talks could happen. Yrmthu for her part argued that while the Skapatoria program was important and necessary, any progress it was doing were naught compared to the constant stream of misery caused by the Barrad rogue regime. She argued for a temporary reallocation of resources towards the singular goal of ending the magocracy and therefore finally put an end to the Xatisa. Áltu Kexa spoke last and denounced in decidedly undiplomatic language the oppressive regimes of Barrad and Austurland, imploring that under no circumstances should there be any shaking of hooves with those oppressors, or any."

kasa.19.d:0 "It was early in the afternoon when Áltu Kexa got on the stage of the Ilha Rosca amphitheater. She was supposed to read some of her poems but her heart was not into it. They felt hollow and weak. The zebra looked at the crowd, eager to hear her speak. Was she supposed to give them all what they wanted? Something to feel good about themselves? She sighed and in a flash of clarity, threw her poems to the wind.\n\n"My dear compatriots,\n\nI wish to ask you all a question. Are we free? Do we deserve to be? The simple answer might be that we are and do because we can ask those questions. Freedom is not an alien concept nor is it a privilege that is to be gained. It is our birthright, our very natural state. Chains, debts and the very vocabulary of servitude, those are the constructs, those are the lies that deny us access to the real world and rob us of our potential.\n\nAs we speak, thousands upon thousands remain bound by those lies. In Gryphus, in Barrad, in Austurland, even in the Coalition of River hypocrites, lied to by knights, merchants, kings and so-called democratic leaders! Liars, all of them! And yet, these bound creatures have the right to think, to live, to yearn to be more because the words that would deny them those rights are but ink on paper!\n\nFor as long as it existed, Kasa has been an experiment in demonstrating this. Each day, our sisters and brothers of all walks of life get up and prove to the world at large that no life is so meaningless as to deserve to be reduced into slavery or serfdom. And yet, we have allowed this experiment to restrain itself. Mansu Erba has done many great things indeed, of that I cannot claim the contrary, but our Avo has let herself be swayed by the tepid and timid in her circle. And now, those meek of heart claim to lead us forward? Shame on us if we let that happen! Shame!\n\nKása! O Kása of my heart! How you deserve more! How the world deserves more than the champions of freedom to lie around, fat, feeble and idle. The slaves of the world deserve more resolve than to extend a hoof of peace to those who would see them enslaved! In this cause of freedom, we need to be as fanatical as the knights of Opinicus, as entitled in our beliefs as the kings of Wittenland and as ruthless as those who would see us with iron around our hooves!\n\nMy name is Áltu Kexa and I hereby announce my candidacy for First Commander in the name of all who still reel under the yoke of tyranny!""

### Election aftermath events

kasa.20.t:0 "Tallying the votes"
kasa.20.d:0 "It had been a long and interesting campaign for all in Kàsa. There had been so many high moments, even if they were marred in controversy or tragedy. It was really the first time that they all got to vote in a way that would be so determinant on the choice for First Commander. Never before had the electoral system and timing of change in leadership allowed for such a thing to occur. Some nostalgic were not all that happy about it but to many, it was endearing. A new way of doing things. And for the one who would take the mantle of First Commander, it would be something to ponder upon.\n\nIn the end, the campaign ended like all others as every Kàsan went and voted for their representatives to the council. But even when the results were announced, everyone knew that it wasn't over yet as those councillors had now to vote on their choice for First Commander. There was some certitude about the vote of some of them but you could never truly be sure until the fateful vote at the Seguro Council."

The former secretary humbly swore his oath to serve Kása before taking his seat in the traditional wicker chair left vacant since the resignation of Mansu Erba.\n\nIn his victory speech, Lûa Ramedi remained brief and promised citizens that work would resume as quickly as possible for the benefit of all. He also assured that he would not be deaf to the sincere wishes expressed by those who did not offer him their suffrage, promising that he would seek to reach a virtuous consensus as much as possible."
kasa.21.a:0 "To a continued legacy!"

kasa.22.t:0 "The Solemn Bookkeeper" ### Pasarinha elected
kasa.22.d:0 "In a comfortable majority, the Council of Kása nominated Pasarinha as the eighth First Commander of the Kása Free State. Despite the vote being generally calm, a few protesters in the back of the Council room deployed flags calling for answers regarding the Xatisa, oppression in Barrad and Gryphus and continued slavery in Austurland. The most agitated protesters were escorted out while most of them were allowed to remain at the request of Pasarinha himself. The former financial expert swore his oath to serve Kása before taking his seat in the traditional wicker chair left vacant since the resignation of Mansu Erba.\n\nThe new First Commander gave a speech in a quiet and restrained fashion.\n\n"It is a difficult task ahead indeed. Our nation, for all its industriousness and innovativity, has been forced to contend with many roadblocks. From the continued threat of violent actors to extremism and a land where the list of tasks ahead seems endless. However, with the help of our Macawian friends and our own limitless potential, I know that there is little that is out of our reach. My own work will not be to provide you all with answers and graces like the kings in the west but rather to offer you the means of overcoming your own issues and spread your wings. Kása ought not to be a family home led by overbearing parents but a place in which we can all benefit from an equal chance in life and grow. My hope is that we can all finally enter the adult age of Kása with a long and prosperous life ahead of us.\n\nI wish to conclude with this promise. To all Kásan workers, sailors, farmers and employees in all their diversity of skills, struggles and responsibilities, I vow before you to offer you a Kása that will prioritize your future, your prosperity and your safety above all. Thank you all and good day.""

kasa.23.t:0 "The Example" ### Yrmthu elected
kasa.23.d:0 "In a comfortable majority, the Council of Kása nominated Yrmthu as the eighth First Commander of the Kása Free State and the first Kásan of non-zebrican lineage to ever occupy the office. In a display of her desire to see a more inclusive system, she stretched the ability of the new First Commander's right to invite some creatures for the ceremony by inviting Xatisa survivors and municipal politicians from all over instead of relatives and friends. The former councillor swore her oath to serve Kása before taking her seat in the traditional wicker chair left vacant since the resignation of Mansu Erba.\n\nYrmthu's speech was short but also solemn and warm.\n\n"Forty years ago, the Barrad horror changed the lives of many thousands of creatures. None of those who fled or those who welcomed them asked for this. In this historical injustice, Kása and our dear Mansu Erba proved to the world that they were more than posturing. In this great occasion, I wish to thank all those who lived up to the creaturian ideals of the First Village as well as those who continue to do so. However, it is also time that we recognize that this seminal tragedy is still ongoing as we speak and unless all is done to put an end to it, Kása will remain forced to endure sacrifices after sacrifices to care for those castaway by the Barradian tyrants. I wish us all to be free of such burden and will do everything in my power to finally put an end to his chapter of our history, to not let Mansu Erba's tireless work be in vein.\n\nI have also heard the fear of some regarding the idea of a Wittenlandic leading this nation forward in an era where Wittenland still has much to do to prove its good faith. Let me assure all today that my intentions are to follow the spirit of the Kásan legacy from the days of Ilha Rosca. It is my firm intention to see power concentrated here once more devolved to every citizen of the Free State. No betrayal would be greater than a move towards an imperial and authoritative. It is therefore with great pleasure that I'll conclude this speech to all in Kása thusly: I'll see you all soon and often. Thank you.""

kasa.24.t:0 "The Rhetorical Shift" ### Áltu Kexa elected
kasa.24.d:0 "In a narrow majority vote, the Council of Kása nominated Áltu Kexa as the eighth First Commander of the Kása Free State. The vote was difficult due to a vocal minority of councillors vehemently opposing the putative head of state. Despite their attempts at claiming the electoral campaign as non-binding, the Council eventually voted to follow the democratic choice. A few councillors still protested the election by walking out as the famed poetress swore her oath before taking her seat in the traditional wicker chair left vacant since the resignation of Mansu Erba.\n\nKexa's speech was long and fiery. Yet, in the end, it was an uncharacteristically solemn Kexa who pronounced these words:\n\n"In this day, Kása has made a fateful choice. The choice of maintaining its legacy, a legacy of the most righteous and arduous cause of all. The cause of Liberty and Abolitionism. I applaud you all, even the skepticals we suffered today, for allowing yourself to choose such a mission over the sweet yet superfluous comfort of indifference. I will not lie. The task ahead will not be one of laughter but I promise you that when all is said and done and when I'll leave this wicker chair in my dying breath, we will have been paid in full in knowing that we stood true to those who revolted on the D'Vah, to those who stood against the most dire of odds in the hope of liberty.\n\nI see many even within this venerable house who look away in fear. To those, I say this. Do not look away, citizens of Kása, for we are walking the path set for us by the likes of Akeeku and Sinóra. Find the strength in your soul and stand proud as Kásans.""

kasahistory.11.d:0 "Kása's people are taught their history through the Remembrance of Soka. It is a long and winding tale that recounts their past beginning the D'Vash slave revolt at the behest of their national hero, Akeeku Soka. They are taught not only this but it is created in the same sense as you would expect a song or poem in verse. The residents of Kása do not only know the words, but know how to sing it. Every citizen is taught this and the Remembrance of Soka is constantly having things suggested to be added to it. Only when the Council of Elders, residing in Ilha Rosca, decrees a new verse is something officially added; most recent example of this was the introduction of Chapter 30 in 1003, originally written and submitted by the famed poet Áltu Kexa. While citizens are not officially required to memorize it, it is required to pass basic history schooling within the realm of Kása. It is also the best introduction for foreigners to learn Kása's history as told by the Kásans.\n\nThe history itself is only written down in a single place: on clay tablets displayed at the Grand Remembrance Hall housed inside the marooned D'Vash in Ilhas Rosca's harbour. From there it is recounted to children and adults by oral tradition. Only those who can repeat the remembrance from memory are allowed to become leaders of Kása.\n\nReader, beware, treat the Remembrance of Akeeku as a form of both history and myth. For only those present during those times know what the truth is behind this recorded history. Further more, this is a roughly translated version, understanding that it is not officially spoken nor written anywhere in Ponish. This is simply what our diplomats and translation bureau has managed to create for you to read."

### Lûa Ramedi events
luakasa.1.t:0 "Gifts from Abroad"
luakasa.1.d:0 "Certain problems were pleasant such, and the issue that had come before Lûa Ramedi was one of these. His call for the many expats and emmigrants that had left Kása to come back and aid their homeland had borne fruit beyond his wildest dreams. All estimates indicated that thousands had begun to return back to Kása, and even more had taken up sending remittances back to aid the country.\n\nYet, the most pleasant surprises had come from an unexpected source. The first was from Macawia, where a Kásan migrant had managed to found a sizeable company which specialized in electronic machines. She was offering to move the entire company over to Kása, and requested aid in the transfer. As a show of what they were able to do, she had sent over an electric typewriter, and Lûa Ramedi could not deny that the feel of the machine was exquisite.\n\nIn the other end, it turned out that a former Barrad refugee had family that fled to the River Republic instead, and who had developed a wide contact network among the republic's ponies, including several scholars that, apparently, were looking for new employment. So why then was this a problem? Simple, the budget allotted for this would not allow for both the company transfer and recruiting the scholars, meaning that the time had come to weigh the pros and cons. It was an annoyance, but it was the choice between two good things."

luakasa.2.t:0 "What is Freedom?"
luakasa.2.d:0 ""One of the defining moments of my foalhood, one that I remember even today, is when my father brought home a book. It was a gift for my mother, yet I recall looking at it in the bookshelf, wondering what had made my mother so excited. I remember asking my parents what the signs over various shops said, piecing together what these strange symbols meant, and a few days after my fifth birthday I came walking into the kitchen, holding that book, and reading the title out loud: 'Number one Manehattan Herald Bestseller. A Forbidden Flame.'\n\nIt took me a long time to understand just why I was given cake on the condition that I never spoke of that book again, yet something about that stuck with me. Being able to read had given me cake, and if that was the case, what could I not gain from the countless other skills that education offered? Let this anecdote stand as evidence that I stand here not as some singular genius, but as a regular zebra who had the opportunities, and were motivated by interest far beyond anycreature's control. I wanted cake, later on I had good teachers who could nurture my growth, and then the joy instilled in me carried me through my education, and later employment, and in the end to this position.\n\nI do not plan to make any claims of being exceptional, the opposite, and I want to ask you this. What would a nation where everycreature could have the opportunities I had be like? Disregarding the brilliant minds of our academies, what of those trapped on their farms, or in the slums, or in a refugee camp, too starved to even think properly? How much is wasted simply because the ambitious, the driven, those who would have been the first to rise up alongside Akeeku himself, yet now find themselves trapped in a world where the answers are not as obvious?\n\nBreaking the chains is all well and good, but he who does not know the world around him, is forever in bondage. The challenges of Kása today lies not in a desperate revolt, but in education and training. The world is changing more and more, and we must equip out people to be ready for the world that awaits them. We do this not by firebrand speeches or valiant last stands, but by patient education and ceaseless improvement. We should raise not only freedom fighters, but engineers and scientists as well, and the quill is our weapon more than the sword ever was in this struggle.""

I cannot for the life of me recall where, precisely, I read this quote, or whether I have simply conjured it myself from faint memories and a desire to recall it as poignant, yet the gist of it was that philosophy concerns itself with what is true, and politics - if executed properly and under just leadership - is about implementing what is true onto the world.\n\nOne of the effects of this state of affairs, is that blind dogmatism by definition is cripped: it offers one answer, no matter the context. Conversely, a sober and sometimes dispassionate assessment of the state of affairs has been and will remain the best tool of any leader. As it stands, one of the key assessments to be made is this: there has never been as many challengers for the position of First Commander as there were in the past election. This is an unavoidable fact, yet what does it mean?\n\nIt means - I maintain - that the Kása of today is not the Kása declared by Sinora Pon, nor the Kása that my honored predecessor assumed leadership of. In prosperity, there has been change, and while desperate times call for the exceptional among us to assume leadership, prosperity and progress allows for the slower growing talents to be nurtured.\n\nWe all know the famous "potato decree", where Sinora Pon made the choice regarding Kása's central crop. It was not so that Kása would forever rely on potatoes, it was so that in those times of famine, Kása would have a reliable crop which could provide for us all. None would claim we are failing Kása by growing carrots, or lettuce, or apples. It is merely that in times of plenty, we can afford greater variety. I maintain that the same holds true in regards to leadership.\n\nMore and more Kásans stand tall enough to be a worthy first commander - I stood against three others who each would have led the nation well - and the more our nation prospers, the more this number will grow. For this reason, the time has come to rethink my position. The role of First Commander, that served us so well, is becoming more and more unsuited for a maturing Kása, one filled with informed, driven and able creatures who every day prove themselves not only able but willing to have a say in their fate. For this reason, Kása must reform. For this reason, the time has come to democratize her.""

luakasa.4.t:0 "What is Wealth?"
luakasa.4.d:0 ""As the Prudutu Projektu continues on, we are seeing not just a progress, but something much deeper, something that shows why this era has in Griffonia and Equus been called "the industrial revolution". The very conditions of our society are changing, and the things that once made some among us wealthy has come to fade into the background, forcing the old guard to compete in a new type of economical game.\n\nWhat is particularly obvious is the fact that with this progress our society has become more tightly linked than ever before, and that conditions for our people are changing fundamentally. This includes their economic conditions, and what once served them well is now found wanting. There was a time where giving the refugees crossing the border food, blankets and in the end a small patch of land to live off served them well, yet this is no longer the case.\n\nEconomists would speak of us transitioning from an agrarian to an industrial economy, and that patch of land might have provided food, but it does not provide money. It does not buy the foals clothes to wear to school - indeed school might become an issue when every hoof is needed on the farm. It does not provide for the comforts of modern life, nor does it offer much in the way of options to better one's station in life.\n\nTo this end, it is imperative that new answers are offered by the Kásan government. When the majority of our people do not work their own land, but instead have taken employment for various companies, are we to leave them at the whims of their employers, who by necessity must be concerned with the bottom line? In an era where trade deals grow and become even more complex, can we truly rely on individual actors working on our behalf instead of uniting our efforts under one central trading authority?\n\nThese questions and more will need to be addressed, and the answers provided by the government will have to be such that they enrich the average Kásan. If Kása advances as a nation but leaves it people behind, then it is doomed to fail in the end.""

luakasa.5.t:0 "Rainy Dedication"
luakasa.5.d:0 ""Too many times, Kása has been pushed to the brink, and as many times, she has seen heroes rise to the cause, ready to fight to the bitter end." Lûa Ramedi read solemnly from the speech, standing under the cover of the umbrella in the pouring rain. The crowd in front of him were silent, listening reverently to him. The monument - a monument to the heroes of Kása - had taken months to finish. "We owe these heroes our prosperity, our freedom and our very nation" Lûa Ramedi continued, "Though our words might be insufficient, and though we cannot honor those who fell in life, we can do so in death." With that, he looked up and the monument was unveiled, provoking a murmur of shocked and dismayed gasps from the onlookers.\n\nThe monument, far from honoring the dead, showed a dead Zebra soldier, his front leg seemingly torn off, being held by a crying pony. To the left, a griffon sat curled up, clutching his head with an expression of blind terror on his face, and to the right, a gravestone stood surrounded by a weeping family.\n\nShock turned to anger, and soon angry voices were crying out at Lûa Ramedi, asking what was wrong with him, demanding it to be torn down, yelling that he spat in the face of those heroes he just had praised. Lûa Ramedi, meanwhile, waited for a while, letting them vent their rage, before he turned to one of the guards and nodded. The guard walked up, taking his rifle and aiming it into the sky, firing off a round. The sudden crack of the gun left the crowd startling and left a moment of silence.\n\n"That sound," Lûa Ramedi told them, "was enough to make a soldier I met six years ago throw himself under my desk. The horrors of war left him so scarred that the sound of a slamming door threw him right back onto the battlefield. What honor is there in having become so broken? What glory is there in bleeding out far from home, clutching your wounds and crying out for help even though none can hear you. It would be so easy to just talk of honor and glory, downplaying the horrors because it makes us uncomfortable. But for all those who bled so that we may stand here, safe and prosperous, we owe them recognition, and we owe them this understanding. Their deaths were not glamorous, their suffering not glorious, and if we ever forget this, then we will have truly betrayed those who gave it all."\n\nThe crowd fell silent, the steam taken out of them, and only the rain could be heard, Lûa Ramedi turning to the statue and bowing deeply, leaving the others to follow suit."

luakasa.6.t:0 "Testing, Testing..." 
luakasa.6.d:0 "When Amendua had brought home that strange wooden box, there had been a slight argument in the family. Aunt Ostra had fervently objected to the "cursed box", saying that they had enough dark magic across the mountains in Barrad, so why were they bringing it into the house? It has taken three hours to talk her down and convince her that the box was no more magical than a stove, and that it wasn't going to eat them any more than the new electrical light was. Even as Amendua was twisting the knobs to see if they could get the radio to work, she kept her distance from it, muttering about new-fangled craziness, but then the murmur from the radio changed, a crackle followed and suddenly they could hear words coming from it, leaving the entire family to lean in awe.\n\n"...listening to Kása Public Radio, and I am Sábi Vós, speaking to you from our studio in Seguro" the voice coming out of the radio said, speaking calmly and formally. "For those who are just turning in: I am here in the studio with our First Commander, Lûa Ramedi, who has agreed to answer questions provided by you, dear listeners. First Commander, thank you for being here."\n\n"It is my pleasure," another voice said, and the family leaned in a bit more.\n\n"Is that really him?" Amendua's mother wondered, and Amendua nodded.\n\n"Yes, remember during the election? We saw him, he was the fourth speaker, remember? He sounded like that."\n\n"He sounds boring," Amendua's little brother commented, Amendua covering his mouth right as Sábi Vós asked her first question.\n\n"Our first question comes from Amendua of Ilha Rosca," Sábi Vós said, being drowned out when Amendua gave up a squeal of surprise and glee, the entire family looking to her in surprise. "He asks whether you would like to tell the nation a joke." The family's looks turned quizzical and Amendua grinned awkwardly."

luakasa.7.t:0 "A Moment in Life"
luakasa.7.d:0 "The classroom was filled with ponies, zebras and griffons of all ages, and Inxina felt thrilled as she half bounced inside and sat down on the desk, looking at them. Smiling widely, she looked at the students, not saying anything, and after only a few seconds she noticed that some of the students were starting to fidget. One of them seemed about to speak up, but Inxina raised her hoof, gently shushing him, and looked at the rest of them. Nearly a minute had passed before she finally spoke up.\n\n"It's really awkward in here, don't you think?!" She asked them merrily, watching how half of them startled in their seats as she did. "Hi!" She grinned "I'm Inxina, and I'll be your teacher in this class, and I really, really don't like homework. Let's go around the classroom, and each of you tell me your names, and something about you. Make it something fun!" she requested, and the students slowly began to introduce themselves. When they came to the old zebra in the back she gave her name, Ostra, and mentioned she used to be a pearl fisher. Inxina instantly pounced on it.\n\n"Pearl fishing, isn't it true that for a while that was Kása's biggest industry?" She asked, noticing how Ostra got a different look in her eyes. Almost unprompted, the old lady agreed with her, beginning to describe her old profession in detail, the tools they had used, the stories of the great pearls that sometimes could be found, and of course the most important lesson of all; that pearls took time to form, and anyone who said 'why not just take up all the oysters' didn't know what they were talking about.\n\n"Thank you," Inxina smiled when Ostra finished. "Now, did you hear all that?" She said, "There's a lot to be learned from that, for me too. This school, along with the others, aren't meant to be just us talking to you. We can all learn from each other, and while it's true there's certain things that I will teach you, you will also be able to teach each other. Just there you had a primer - first hoof - on one of Kása's first industries. Thank you, Ostra.""

luakasa.8.t:0 "A Thoughtful Break"
luakasa.8.d:0 "Amendua sat down on the bench with a heavy sigh, wiping his forehead. Things really were picking up these days, and judging from how more and more constructions projects opened up each week, it was going to keep picking up. He looked to the side, seeing his cousin having picked up his water bottle and wordlessly holding out his hoof, asking to have some.\n\n"Well one thing is for sure," he commented after getting the bottle. He took a swig of water, sighing in pleasure before handing it back. "We'll have work for years to come if this continues.\n\n"Did you see the newspapers?" Strubon asked, "They're expanding the harbor, all the way over there," Strubon pointed towards the edge of the bay. Amendua whistled in surprise.\n\n"Work work," he commented. "Ostra won't be happy though..." he grimaced. "She always fished pearls in that area."\n\n"Yeah..." Strubon grimaced. "You know what we should do?" he said suddenly. "We should buy her a boat."\n\n"What?" Amendua asked, "What are you imagining now?"\n\n"I mean that she's not going to be able to keep up the pearl fishing, not like before. She's old, and she's only gonna get older... but remember that weird griffon that came here a whole ago. The... you know, he talked all  'a-bipara-boo-papa' something?" \n\n"Wingbardy?" Amendua asked, unable to stop a snerk of laughter.\n\n"Yeah, he was fascinated with the pearl fishing... and Ostra's a good teacher. She helped us both to learn how to swim. She could start taking tourists out to the water, show them the oysters and how to find pearls, right? I earned three days' wages just taking that one bird around town. And if Ostra has a proper boat, maybe she'd consider it?"\n\n"How can you be so dumb and yet so smart at the same time?" Amendua asked, Strubon responding by pouring the last water in the bottle over him."

luakasa.9.t:0 "To Care for the Poor"
luakasa.9.d:0 "Lûa Ramedi knew he was considered a boring zebra. He had long since given up on attempting to challenge that perception of him, and instead he chose to simply embrace it. Still, as he signed the document in front of him, he thought to himself that anyone who did not feel the thrill of something like this was missing out. The cameras flashed in front of him as he ran the pen over the dotted line, and as he put the pen down he held it up, smiling for the journalists. It was bit of a show, but the three hundred page document that lay on his table was a bit too stodgy for most creatures to get through.\n\n"With this, Kása will finally be given a welfare system fit for the new age." A very generalized claim, a quite hollow one too, but it was still true. His main concern was that he might appear as though he was talking down the achievements of his predecessor. That would not do. \n\n"Building on the work of those who came before us, we can now make sure that those suffering hunger or poverty will be guaranteed help in a timely manner." The devil of course was in the details; the main thrust of the new law concerned government support, accountability and regular evaluation to make all the various charitable organisations in the country pull in the same direction, but that was not very stirring.\n\n"The spirit of Kásan charity and kindness has carried our people far, and I am proud to make sure that this spirit is supplemented by action, and to say to those who have dedicated themselves to help feed and clothe their fellow creatures that they do not stand alone any longer." Technically they never had, Mansu Erba especially had always been there for them, but as with so many things, all it would take was a single unsuited leader, and it all would have collapsed. Helping the people was a too important role to just surrender to the state, but that didn't mean that laws couldn't help secure it. Details, details, details. It bored the common creature, but he adored them."

luakasa.10.t:0 "The First Minister"
luakasa.10.d:0 "The council chamber had been pretty much completely cleaned out over the last weeks, and the old layout had been replaced with a new setup, much more akin to the types of parliamentary chambers used elsewhere. The speaker sat in the front and the council members sat in the rows of benches that circled around in front of the speaker. The rafters above were filled with creatures, all watching what was going on below, where Lûa Ramedi stood by the speaker's pulpit.\n\n"When I rose to the position of First Commander, I was given immense power, power that has served Kása for a long time. Yet the Kása of today is not the Kása of a hundred years ago, and during my campaign, I had the honor of standing by several good and capable candidates, who each would have become splendid leaders in their own right. My predecessor knew this. Indeed it was her keeping her advisors so close that let Kása have so many options. She gave us a gift in this, and this gift was Kása's first breath of democracy. Instead of slowly letting this breath vanish, and claim to know better than her, it is my honor to put into law what she put into principle."\n\n"Each of the representatives here, chosen and trusted by their constituents, shall from now on have a voice equal to mine, and I will stand down if I am found wanting in my duties. I will serve not as a commander, but as a minister, and my role will be to help this assembly reach a conclusion, not come to it myself. My fellow councilmembers, it is my honor to welcome you here, to serve alongside me, and I hope that you will all continue with me on the road that our Avo laid down before us. Thank you."\n\nApplause rung through the council chamber as Lua Ramedi bowed his head, feeling the weight slowly lift from his shoulders. Seeing something in the corner of his eyes, he realized to his surprise that a young filly had come up to him, holding out a flower boquette to him, and he accepted it awkwardly, hearing how the Kasan national anthem began to play. Feeling his cheeks redden, he joined in as the entire council began to sing, together, as it was meant to be."

luakasa.11.t:0 "To Defend Harmony" 
luakasa.11.d:0 ""...and in this capacity, you are sworn to, above all else, fight to uphold harmony and democracy and to safeguard its values." Lûa Ramedi was speaking before a large formation of soldiers, hoof-picked from the Kásan military. They wore dark grey uniforms, seemingly made to blend in with the stone walls of the First Commander's residence. "In this, your appointment is political, for you are entrusted with not merely obedience, but to fight for the principles that have guided Kása since its inception. As the Guardians of the Republic, you are sworn to no creature, and no creature can call upon you for this purpose." The battalion cheered as he finished, saluting them, and Lûa Ramedi felt a small prick of anxiousness. Yet, he had committed himself to this course of action, and therefore spoke up when they were finished.\n\n "As your first order," he told them "I must hereby declare martial law, and order you to arrest the council on charges of treason. I have evidence they are threatening democracy, and you must seize them, now."\n\nThe entire ground fell silent, with three hundred pairs of eyes staring at him. The joy was gone, uncertainty taking its place, and he noticed a couple of soldiers in the back taking a half step away, as if they wondered if they were to obey. In the end, their commanding officer stepped up to him, placing a hoof on his shoulder.\n\n"No," she said plainly, and Lûa Ramedi let out a visible sigh of relief. It had worked after all. Of course it would have worked, it would have been strange if it didn't, and the colonel was a sensible zebra. But if it hadn't... he felt vertigo at the idea.\n\n"Take after your commander's example, soldiers," he said, feeling as though he needed to sit down. "Tyranny springs so easily from misguided zeal to preserve liberty. You are no-one's thugs. Remember this." As much as he tried to keep himself calm, his voice quivered a bit at the end there.\n\n"Yes, First Commander!" the entire unit bellowed in response, Lûa Ramedi seeing how they seemed as relieved as him and he smiled, saluting them. Now they understood."

luakasa.12.t:0 "The First President"
luakasa.12.d:0 "The entire courtyard was packed with onlookers, all the way up to the fence separating them from the rows of soldiers that flanked the path up to the podium. Cameras flashed as Lûa Ramedi walked between them, his head held high. He made sure to keep a dignified bearing and a confident appearance, yet inwardly he found himself still fretting. All was in place, he was sure of it. The constitution had been approved, and the councilmembers had agreed to it. Were there objectors? Certainly, yet the power of the First Commander let him overrule them. They couldn't do much about it other than object, at least not until today. Reaching the stage, he stopped before the judge that awaited him. The old stallion held a book of laws out towards him, and Lûa Ramedi placed his hoof on it.\n\n"Lûa Ramedi," the old stallion said. "The People of the Free State have trusted you with the position of President of the Kása Free State. You will inherit a legacy centuries old, and you will serve as the foremost champion for the values our founders laid down for us. Lûa Ramedi, will you serve the Republic as the duties of the office demands?"\n\n"I, Lûa Ramedi do solemnly swear to serve the Republic as my duty demands." Lûa Ramedi replied, "I swear to safeguard and uphold the values on which she was founded and to never allow tyranny or slavery to torment her people again. I swear to respect and protect her institutions, her laws and her people against enemies foreign and domestic."\n\nHe had written and vetted the oath himself, and yet it struck like a sledgehammer, making it all final for him. It was done, he had taken the step and changed the position of First Commander into President, and unless something drastic happened, this was forever.\n\nHe turned around to face the crowd, raising one hoof as the cheers filled the air. He smiled, if stiffly, and heard the gun salute echo through the air. The Guardians of the Republic turned all to face him, saluting him and greeting him with a thunderous 'Hail to the President!' as the cameras almost blinded him. That weight on his shoulders was still there, heavier than ever. Yet, it was his to bear, the role he had been entrusted with, and he would carry it to the end."

luakasa.13.d:0 "The massive dam stretched for over half a kilometer across the river, having created a giant lake to their right that gleamed in the sun, and Lua Ramedi looked out across it in awe. It was splendid, and he couldn't help but smile as he looked out across the crowd.\n\nTens of thousands of workers had come together for this, and the infrastructure needed had been a challenge in and of itself, the investments staggering, and merely making sure it all ran smoothly had by all accounts been a headache. And yet, it had all worked out, and now they stood atop the great Akeeku dam. Maybe it was presumptuous to think it, but he'd like to imagine that this was a better monument to their founder than any statue or plaza.\n\n"It is my honor to stand here with you all today," he said, looking around at the crowd surrounding him. "Today we are all bearing witness to an achievement as worthy of celebration as the greatest of Kása's triumphs. So much of our history has been written in pain and blood by those heroes who were ready to give it all, and yet so much of our security and happiness has come from creatures like the ones who worked here. Creatures like Stratos, who dove down to catch a falling worker at the edge of the dam during the collapse six months ago, and who everyone who worked here insists 'worked for three'. Like the architect Beam Compass, who spotted a design flaw and ceaselessly pleaded with his superiors until they listened. Like Amendua and Strubon, who came here from the Ilhas Rosca to work, and who have not taken a single day off in the six months they worked here - and if those two are listening, I will discuss this with your supervisor regarding how he could have allowed that." A chuckle spread among the crowd and Lûa Ramedi smiled widely.\n\n"Everyone, we have built this wonder together, from my office down to the regular laborer, and we may have worked with hammers instead of spears, but we have nevertheless struggled together, and through this, we have given each other a gift that will stand the test of time, a monument to our harmony and our friendship." With that, he cut the red ribbon to inaugurate the dam, smiling joyously as the thunderous applause, stomping of hooves and cheering rose to the sky."

Under these two leaders, Kása has become a strong enough presence in the far east that they can no longer be ignored.\n\nA dispatch has arrived from Seguro - the Kásan capitol, where they are formally requesting for Kása to be allowed into the Concordat.

Appealing to Asterion had been the right course of action, and they had given their promise that they'd champion Kása's accession to the Concordat of Free Nations. That meant Kása no longer stood alone, and that in the battle to protect themselves they would be able rely on not just themselves but other nations as well. The River Coalition was too volatile, the Equestrians on the other side of the planet, the empire out of the question for so many ways. Yet, the Concordat had been as good a possible alliance as he could have hoped for, and while it meant Kása would have foreign entanglements from now on, Lûa Ramedi knew that friendship was a two way road, and if they had to go to war, fighting for their friends was as good a reason as he could have asked for."

Sadly, politics weren't always a rational affair, and it seemed Kása would stand on her own in the future as well. She had done it before, and she could do it again.

"And I do not wish to express anything but my most sincere admiration for your efforts, but I do not see how the Kása Free State could become a member of the River Federation at this time."\n\n"I am aware of the reservations you might have," River Swirl said, "but that is part of why I wanted to extend the offer. The Federation is colourful, but as you see there are harmonic forces within it, strong such, and even if we disregard the economic advantages and the mutual defence, Kása would be a positive force within it."\n\n"That is just the problem," Lûa Ramedi said, shaking his head. "Kása was founded by rebellious slaves seeking freedom, and yet the Federation stands back to back with slavers and tyrants. You may wrap it in diplomatic terms, but my people won't. Thousands among us fled from Wittenland and the pentarchy, and if Wittenland wishes to maintain that Barrad was still part of them, the atrocities there are still theirs to answer for. And that is not to mention the fact that we might well be called to defend these tyrants, slavers and murderers. Tolerance is a wonderful thing - at times - but I can count the Kásans who'd willingly rally to fight for some of your member states on my hooves."\n\n"Are you willing to entertain less drastic commitments, then?" River Swirl asked, dropping the topic and setting her sights lower. "The Federation has nothing to worry about when it comes to you, and I hope you'd be willing to accept a pact to make sure that Kása, whatever happens, won't have anything to fear from us either."\n\n"That much I can accept," Lûa Ramedi nodded.

But even he felt an unease static in his guts, like a crawling insect, as he sat still and looked down at his notes. His speech. A mic hung just before his muzzle, while technical staff sat on the sides by their equipment.\n\n"A minute, sir," an aide told Lûa and offered the zebra a water glass. One he eagerly accepted. It eased his mood a bit and he took a deep breath. There was rapid movement, as the radio operators activated their equipment, readying it all for the broadcast. At last, a crackle shimmered from the mic before his eyes and from the side he heard the fateful announcement: "This is Radio Seguro, here to deliver the address from Lûa Ramedi."\n\nThe silence was dominant as soon as the announcer's voice died down. For a moment, Lûa feared he could not even speak. But as he looked down upon his notes and saw the words, a force in his mind pushed him to act. She deserved it.\n\n"When the death of our beloved Avo was announced, a deep blow struck all of us. A somber chord, that made us cease our daily lives and still the rattles of the modern world. From Seguro to Fyrport, from Ilha Rosca to Retorno, we all paused to realize the news. To understand the sorrow that has overwhelmed us.\n\n"Mansu Erba was greatly loved by Kása, for her kindness and selfless services throughout her life. The late First Commander never grew up expecting or yearning to lead. For her, the leadership was given at a perilous time likes of which this nation had not seen in a generation. Challenges that required hard choices and direct actions. Our Avo took upon this great burden to serve us all. To protect our democracy and way of life against dark forces.\n\n"What can we say about her reign then? We thought of her as a wise ruler, one who wished to ail our ills. We have heard her speak about kindness that vanquishes the evil fears that grip us. We saw her tour the land and see all those who came to meet her. We have thought of her as our grandmother, who we trust implicitly, for we know she means only well to us, her people."

But her firmness to duty was resolute and her wisdom saw a truth we were yet to realize; that a nation cannot rely simply upon one creature.\n\n"I have been asked many times in my life what I thought of the late Mansu Erba. To them I have responded with this: kindness. Kindness, that is born from a generous soul that thinks not of self but of others. Kindness, that guides one to do the best. Kindness, that outshines any evil thoughts. It is this kindness that, in this humble secretary's eyes, was her greatest virtue. For where in many other nations despots rule at whims of emotions or tyrants resolved to fulfilling self-centered ideals, our Avo did the one thing that none of these other rulers could ever hope to do; resign. Out of her kindness, she with this final act embodied the ideals that are the foundations of our nation. Rule of the people, for the people, by the people. To not let the powers granted to rulers by the people to be used for naught but in service to them. Such kindness gives us hope and guidance in a world that can often seem so bleak.\n\nFinally, the feeling in his eyes was too much and Lûa wiped them with his hoof.\n\n"When the death finally came, it was not a painful or feared event. Instead, our Avo recognized what was coming and, after a happy, joyful day spent surrounded by her loving family, she fell asleep, to join those who had come before her. To join the ranks of Akeeku and Sinóra, whom overlook us in the plains ethereal. Hers was a life one can only hope to replicate in its fullness, and to be as deserving of universal love.\n\n"It is in this time I wish to extend mine and entire nation's compassion to our Avo's family, to her faithful husband and their children. In this grief, our hearts stand united with you. May our support in this aid and give them strength to bear this sorrow.\n\n"To all of you in Kása, I bid you to take this time to reflect upon yourself at this loss. To see in our late Avo ideals an example to follow. Kindness, that is doable by us all to one another, that lays the foundations of a better world to live in.""

luakasa.20.t:0 "A Talk with Yrmthu"
luakasa.20.d:0 "Have you considered my offer?" Lûa Ramedi asked Yrmthu in front of him. The mare sighed in response as she sank into her chair.\n\n"I know I should be saying yes," she told him, "but I still have my reservations."\n\n"Please tell me them," Lûa Ramedi asked her, "I invited you to discuss it after all."\n\n"You're a good zebra," Yrmthu told him "and while we have our differences... well, at least I know Kása is in competent hooves. I just don't trust the system you're building up. It's more of the same, more of the top-down rule of an establishment far away from the refugees and those living far away from the cities. If we continue like that, more and more, what happens in the end? Not under you, of course, but two First Commanders down the line? Or four?"\n\n"It is still that Kása who has worked tirelessly to try to provide for the refugees, and which has given them a voice," Lûa Ramedi pointed out. "As long as that voice remains, Kása will be obligated to do something."\n\n"Will it?" Yrmthu asked. "Power remains locked in Seguro, and while Mansu Erba and you might listen, that ear can be taken away."\n\n"Not if the people's voice is written into law," Lûa Ramedi replied. "Mansu Erba's strength was that she listened, and I don't want to waste the voice she gave others. I will bring democracy to Kása, in one form or another, and I will give up whatever power I need to ensure that this happens."\n\n"A democracy concerned with Seguro, or with every town and village of Kása?" Yrmthu asked gently, with Lûa Ramedi smiling.\n\n"A democracy concerned with every creature, no matter where they live," he told her."
luakasa.20.a:0 "Good enough, I'm in."

luakasa.21.t:0 "Listening to Pasarinha"
luakasa.21.d:0 "...and in the end, proper investments will pay for themselves, wouldn't you agree?" Pasarinha said cheerfully, balancing a glass of liquor on his hoof as he spoke. Lûa Ramedi had chosen to not partake, being content with just some tea, and he listened calmly as the words just kept flowing from Pasarinha. "This is why it'll benefit Kása the most if we lose any pretenses of protectionism. After all, we built Kása on cooperation with other nations, right? I have associates in Macawia, should I perhaps arrange a dinner with them? You'd be surprised how much can be achieved over some fine dining, and you might make some good contacts as well."\n\n"Yes, yes and no," Lûa Ramedi said, smiling a little. "Thanks for your offer, but I keep my work life separate from my private life. Secondly, I will say this now, and as many time as you need to hear it: I am interested in transparent leadership and Kásan self-governance, and I cannot compromise on these things. The more radical notions you have championed will not come to pass. Call me conservative if you please, but that is the brick wall you'll be running into from now on."\n\n"You know, you really aren't making the best case for keeping me around," Pasarinha commented as he knocked back his drink and poured himself another. "Are you sure you don't want any? A small drop would go great with your tea."\n\n"No thank you, I don't partake at all." Lûa Ramedi replied. "But while I'm not seeking to emulate your programmes, I do plan to listen to them. You are right in that there are worthy things to be found abroad, and Kása does need to listen to what the world has to offer.\n\n"Things like griffon republicanism?" Pasarinha asked pointedly, Lûa raising an eyebrow.\n\n"Well that was a pointed question." He commented, with Pasarinha only grinning. "Are you getting intoxicated?"\n\n"Not for several glasses yet," Pasarinha chuckled happily. "But thanks for your answer, even if it wasn't quite one."

### Pasarinha events

pasakasa.1.t:0 "Pipe and Brandy" #Event where Pasarinha meets with two old time friends; a harpy male and an unicorn mare, both native Kásans. Essentially Pasarinha hires them to aid him in rebuilding Kása, adding them as advisors. Should have semi-romantic undertones between Pasarinha and the pony for the later event.
pasakasa.1.d:0 "Rising as usual at around 05:00, Pasarinha began his day as he usually would. With a cup of black coffee and a newspaper, before the reality set in again. This wasn't his villa in Ilha Rosca, this was the First Commander's residence above the council chambers. And so he remembered the tasks set before him, and got to work. At 05:13, he entered the room of his sleeping secretary, causing quite the rude awakening, "Send a letter to Bicoafi Bolsa, tell him I'd like to see him as soon as he can meet." Pasarinha moved to leave the room as his secretary, still in a nightgown, scribbled down the name and went to send the message.. But before Pasarinha left, he turned back, "Also, see if Eala Seda has time, I'll need both of them for what I have planned." The still half asleep zebra assistant nodded, and began to write a telegram\n\nPasarinha had received a response by 08:30 in the form of a knock at his office door, and through it came a tall harpy dressed in a khaki suit, with a thick white mustache, "My friend!" the harpy exclaimed, "It has been too long!" Pasarinha smiled, comforted by his old friend's presence, "It's been a week, Bico." The harpy laughed, "Well, then that is too long! Now, what do you need my help with?" Pasarinha spread out papers as Bicoafi took a seat in front of him, "I have big plans for this nation, and having people like you helping me with it would be a great asset. You've done business in Kása your entire life, and your experience would be invaluable. I'd like to ask you to become an official advisor and help me guide this nation to prosperity."\n\nBicoafi scratched his chin, "I don't know, my wife says I'm already working too much." Pasarinha frowned, but his friend continued, "But, I am sure she would be fine with it if she knew who it was for. You've helped us out many times in the past, and there isn't anything I wouldn't do for you." Pasarinha smiled widely, "Thank you, Bico. It means a ton." They shook, hoof joined with claw before Bicoafi spoke again, more slyly this time, "So, when is Eala going to be here?" Pasarinha drew back, "How did you know I invited her as well?"\n\nBefore Bicoafi could respond, the door opened again, revealing a unicorn mare in a suit jacket and tie, "Sorry I'm late, Mr. First Commander. I didn't expect a telegram so early, I hope you got my response?" Bicoafi smirked at Pasarinha, but didn't get to say anything before Pasarinha himself began to speak, "You're right on time Eala, and yes, I got it. I'm glad you are on board with helping me as well." Bicoafi piped in, "What a dynamic duo the two of you make, I'm sure it will be fun to see what you two come up with." Pasarinha sputtered a bit before Eala spoke up, "I'm sure all three of us will have a lot to do in the near future. Now Pasarinha, do you happen to have any liquor, I know it's the morning, but I think we're going to have a lot to work through today." Delighted to get down to business, Pasarinha nodded and opened a cabinet, taking out a full bottle of Kásan made brandy.\n\nThe bottle was empty by the end of the day."
pasakasa.1.a:0 "Friendship is valuable."

pasakasa.2.t:0 "A Question Answered" #At the council meeting, a councillor asks Pasarinha what are his plans. The zebra then, very punctually, explains his vision of an urbanized Kása, centered around being a tradelink between Griffonia and Northern Zebrica, particularly with the River Federation in mind. This should draw ire from many councillors, who call out him on seeking profits over proper ideals. But Pasarinha would just ignore the calls, cleaning his pipe until the yelling dies down and then continues to a new topic.
pasakasa.2.d:0 "Pasarinha sighed and closed his notebook. He had a meeting of the council to attend to. His vision of a modern urban Kása had drawn the ire of many, especially those who romanticized the nation's past. But Pasarinha didn't care for them, his vision looked to the future.\n\nBeing within the council chambers was still an eerie feeling, it felt like not long ago that Mansu Erba had made her retirement speech, and here he was. Sitting where she had before. Seated before the council, he prepared to receive their judgment. And receive it he would. After sitting in silence for a moment, another zebra spoke up, a councilor from Bymnonia, and asked, "So First Commander, we've read the documents you've sent us, all many many pages of them. But could you please explain to us in your own words what you wish Kása to become?"\n\nPasarinha nodded, "Very well, councilor." Placing down his papers, Pasarinha walked to the corner of the room where a globe sat. Spinning it around and pointing to Kása, he began; "Kása as a state has neither the population, the resources, the industrial might nor the technological prowess compared to almost any nation in our corner of the world. This is something not easily changed, and so instead of fighting back against our state, we must adapt to it. My vision of Kása is that of a new modern nation, cities acting as centers of commerce dealing in goods and services coming from as far away as the shores of Zebrica where I once served. We can act as the artery that runs between the north and south, profiting from that connection and growing because of it. Holding on to archaic notions that decry this kind of commerce can only hold us back. For Kása's destiny must be aimed forward, not back."\n\nAs silence settles upon the room, Pasarinha tenses up. He knows what is coming.\n\nThe Bymnonian councilor shoots up with unmatched anger, "You would decry our nation's past!? Sell us out to the rich and greedy of the Federation and Gryphus!?" Another creature chimed in, this time an earth pony hailing from north of Fyrport, "You will make us slaves to those who control the markets! Choking out those who merely work to survive!" Bringing up slavery was one step too far for the First Commander, and he moved to respond, but was cut off by the councilor again, "Your vision is one of prosperity for the rich and eternal labor for the poor! Where corporations control the state as they do throughout the rest of the southern seas!" The tirade of insults continued from there, with even more councilors joining in. And for once, Pasarinha was glad his hearing wasn't quite what it used to be. Returning to his seat, he simply took out his pipe and some tobacco, and slowly dragged on it until the councilors were all well and done.\n\n"Are you finished? If so, we can continue the meeting.""
pasakasa.2.a:0 "For good or bad, he has a clear vision."

pasakasa.3.t:0 "Jolly Evening Gathering" #Event where Pasarinha hosts a social gathering for the most influential business owners in Kása. There, he holds a speech where he, initially, thanks them all for their recent efforts to aid the refugees. But he then would, slowly, start to chide key individuals present for trying to offer him bribes or who hold their money in Macawian accounts to avoid inspection by Kásan authorities. Pasarinha should showcase how things are faring in Skyfall, where the Iron Chancellor rules with a firm hoof over an oligarchy of the rich and criminals, where greed has left the common people starving. He then asks from those present if they wish to see such happen in Kása. Slowly, all present swear to never let greed cloud their vision.
pasakasa.3.d:0 "So far, the dinner party in Seguro's council hall had been a success. Pasarinha's guests enjoyed the fine dining and listening to the music played by an orchestra. Many hours had already passed but the time had finally come. Pasarinha motioned to an aide. Soon, the music stopped and the attendants returned to the sides. The gathered guests, well versed in these events, knew what was to come and all eyes turned to Pasarinha, who stood up from his seat. "I thank you all for attending this gathering tonight. I know many of you have come from afar to join me here in the capital that I now call my home." Eager cheers rang out until the zebra raised his hoof. "Thank you, thank you. Yes, I am now your First Commander. As that of entire Kása. Due to this, I too wish to extend my hoof to you. Many of you have arisen to my calls to aid the Xatisa refugees in their blight by charities and joining in the job programs.\n\nAgain, he was met with cheers and shared congratulations. All had done their part. But Pasarinha knew one affair had to be addressed. He once again raised his hoof. "I again thank you all. I know many of you well, and others far more than they deserve." Silence was the answer. In the corner of his eye, Pasarinha saw one particular zebra mare freeze in horror. "Such as you, Fatela" Pasarinha continued, "I have an interesting letter in my pocket here. One that offers a considerably sum of money for aid in judicial procedures. Much like a bribe, wouldn't you say?" His eyes drilled into the mare, who just couldn't respond in her state. But he was not done. Next, he looked to a pony named Tsánta. "And you, good sir. I have a report of clandestine activities in Oferclif that are linked to a company under your name. Care to comment on that?" The pony did not answer.\n\nPasarinha looked throughout the room and sighed. "This is why I have called you all here. To not simply congratulate you but to also warn you. Do not expect me to be bribable or to let you abuse the system. Don't take this warning as a challenge, however. My message is the opposite. I wish to protect your rights. But my oath binds me to protect Kása. Uncontrollable wealth leads to uncontrollable power. Such as in Skyfall. Do you wish to see Kása turned into a playden for the few and powerful? Where the common creature lives bleak lives, unable to change their destinies?" He paused for breath and, again, looked at his guests. "Only by safeguarding our democracy can we survive, for cronyism will only lead to our downfall. What kind of Kása do you wish to live in?"\n\nTheir answer was silence. Though, only for a moment; of all present, of the all present, it was Tsánta who broke it by stomping his hooves in approval. Others joined him, including Fatela. Some went farther, and declared to stand behind Pasarinha. An odd warmth overtook the zebra and he smiled."
pasakasa.3.a:0 "Tyranny of money will never be allowed in Kása."

pasakasa.4.t:0 "Unconventional Decision" #Event where, another brandy and pipe filled everning, Pasarinha listens to his two friends argue over how to deal with the rising organisation within the workers. Harpy thinks they should form national unions so government can overseen them whereas the unicorn thinks the companies need to be enforced to take care of their workers. Pasarinha cuts off the argument by proposing a two-pronged approach; unions will be legalized as free entities as long as they vow to abide by democracy and the government will act as negotiator between the unions and companies to reach agreements at an annual basis.
pasakasa.4.d:0 ""I'm telling you! The unions can be dangerous!" the harpy exclaimed.\n\n"And I'm telling you that unions are only as dangerous as the businesses they work against. Prevent the abuses, prevent the reprisals." Eala groaned.\n\nPasarinha shook his head, these two had been at it forever now. They agreed on most things, and even on things they didn't, they could come to terms. But unions? Unions were a different story.\n\nBoth felt strongly about what they believed, Bicoafi believed that independent unions were inherently subversive and that even the best unions could become breeding grounds for communist elements. While Eala believes that while they may have their flaws, the independence of unions must be preserved in order to protect the rights of workers from predatory business practices.\n\n"Alright, alright," Pasarinha said, "I've heard you go back and forth now for so long that I think either my brain is going to melt, or I'll come up with a solution. So let's try this." Both other creatures leaned in, awaiting their friend's resolution. "I agree with the inherent value of unions, but I can also recognize their possible danger. So let's place a restriction on their ideology, unions must forswear violent and extreme ideologies and must work within our democratic system." Both creatures nodded in agreement.\n\n"Also, as a way to enforce this and encourage productive labour bargaining, the government shall facilitate agreements between corporations and unions once a year."\n\nBicoafi began to chuckle, "Well, there you have it again. Another complicated but effective solution to one of modern society's great conundrums." Bicoafi took a whiskey shot that had been sitting in front of him, "Once again, you impress me."\n\nPasarinha smiled smugly, "I try.""
pasakasa.4.a:0 "Compromise is the best medicine."

pasakasa.5.t:0 "Rethinking the Model" #Event where Pasarinha is silently inspecting his notes at while smoking a pipe. The unicorn would enter and question him about the plans. Pasarinha would then meticulously explain how he imagines Kása's economy as three distinct sectors, build to not compete for quality workers nor in the internal market but orientated to provide good quality products for the international markets. Should carry over the same romantic tones from event 1.
pasakasa.5.d:0 "The office of the First Commander is a surprisingly peaceful place for how much work goes on inside its walls. The room is mildly smokey, with Pasarinha taking long drags on his pipe and small sips of liquor while leafing through paperwork. A record player hums with sounds imported from far away Equestria. As Pasarinha is looking over new documents sent to him by the Commerce Chamber, he hears his door open slowly.\n\n"Who's there?" he asks, and the door opens the rest of the way to reveal Eala standing behind it, in her black suit jacket and scarlet red tie as always, "Sorry, First Commander, I didn't want to disrupt your important work." Pasarinha placed his pipe down and sighed, "You know titles aren't needed, Eala. We knew each other as friends long before I got this job." Eala turns her head, "Is that how you see this? Just a job?" The zebra lowered his papers at this, "I don't think of it as just a job, but I have to run this nation as I always tried to run my business. A boss has a duty to make his business prosper and to try to help his employees, so too does a leader to his nation." Eala circled the desk at which Pasarinha sat, and began to loosen her tie, "So then Mr. Businesszeebra, how do you plan to run this nation going forward? Also, give me a lighter, I've been needing a smoke."\n\nPasarinha passes the unicorn a pocket lighter as she takes a long cigarette holder from her suit, "Well, you see, I've been trying to think about how I can "optimize" Kása's economy, and I think I have a base plan down." Pasarinha gestures for Eala to come closer, and she leans over his shoulder to look at the papers before him, "I see an economy divided into three parts, First, the primary sector, the industry of the earth and what resources come from it, the secondary sector, what can be refined from those resources into industrial products and the tertiary sector, any other intangible things that a nation can exploit for its own gain." Eala stood puzzled, "That's quite a generalization, don't you think? And why bother dividing it up in the first place?" Pasarinha tapped his hoof on the desk, "These industries are naturally built off of one another, competition within the sectors builds economic growth, but disturbances between sectors causes stagnation. It's my, or rather the government's job to optimize the nation to make this cooperation possible."\n\nEala stood upright and began to snicker, "You are your optimization, always trying to make things flow the best they can. You work so hard at it sometimes, I fear you are failing to optimize your own life." Eala took a drag from her cigarette, "What is your end goal anyway? For yourself, I mean." Pasarinha stopped at this question, downed the rest of his shot, and said, "I guess I do need to settle down someday. Find something to dedicate myself to when I am done with government. Or someone, I guess."\n\nEala stared out a window and smiled, "Or someone you say...""
pasakasa.5.a:0 "Now back to economics"

pasakasa.6.t:0 "The Essence of Kása" #Event where Pasarinha holds a speech in the Advisory Council. He speaks about how life has improved and the economical growth that has occured so far. But also says it is not enough yet. He shares his vision of Kása interlocked in the global market and vibrant trade cities where goods between the continents flow through. This time, unlike before, no one yells back at him. At the end, he vows that this Kása will be build
pasakasa.6.d:0 "Two and a half centuries ago," Pasarinha began, "our ancestors reclaimed their destiny and led our people to freedom. They gave their blood, sweat, and tears to sow the seeds of a brighter, more prosperous future. A future where Kása serves as the shining beacon of liberty and progress. Two and a half centuries later, we gather here in these chambers. Outside, Kása flourishes, all thanks to the wonders of the free market." A few councilors rolled their eyes and shook their heads, but the chamber remained quiet, and for the most part, respectful.\n\n"Kása is undergoing rapid modernization. Our cities, the heart and soul of our nation, grow more prosperous by the day, as we reform rundown ghettos and slums into thriving neighborhoods. The unemployment rate is at a record low as the youth of our nation now have well-paying jobs available to them. Our continued investment into the port city of Ilha Rosca continues to bear fruit as we export the finest goods Kása has to offer to new trading partners." His hooves gripped each side of the podium. The councilors in the room looked on, seemingly hanging onto each of the First Commander's words. Some even silently nodded in approval. It seems like it was just yesterday he was shouted down and chastised for his vision of a freer, more prosperous Kása.\n\n"Despite our progress thus far, we are only afforded a brief moment of respite, for our work is far from complete. Many of our people, be they Kása born or Barradian refugees who have risked everything in search of a better future, still live in abject poverty. They're uneducated and unskilled laborers, and it is our duty to provide them with an affordable education and equal opportunity in the workforce."\n\n"We have come a long way, but we must finish what we started, and secure Kása's place in the world as the leading exemplar of democracy and freedom. Thank you, and good evening." Raucous applause and stomping of hooves filled the room, many councilors even rising to their feet and cheering in appreciation of the First Commander's speech. Pasarinha finds it hard not to smile to himself. At last, vindication."
pasakasa.6.a:0 "Onwards, Kása!"

pasakasa.7.t:0 "Old Friends" #Event where Pasarinha and the Macawian ambassador Tómas Riachuelo hold a public meeting by the marooned D'Vash, where they jointly declare the continued friendship and cooperation between the two nations, citing the shared past and love for democracy. This will start with a fresh shipment of arms and artillery to Kása.
pasakasa.7.d:0 ""Kása and Macawia have enjoyed a friendship that have endured for centuries, and will continue to endure for centuries to come," Pasarinha began his speech in the city of Ilha Rosca before a mixed crowd of government officials and members of the press from both Kása and Macawia. "When Akeeku led our ancestors to freedom aboard this ship," he said as he stepped to the side and motioned to the D'Vash behind them, the well-maintained slave ship that now serves as a key heritage site of Kása, "it was the Macawians that rendered aid and stood beside us as we fought off tyranny and would-be conquerors." Gentle applause came from the audience, several in the crowd nodding. "Over the years, our two nations have bled together, cried together, and mourned together. We have also accomplished much together; with Kása's triumphs being Macawia's, just like how Macawia's is Kása's."\n\nThe Macawian diplomat, Tómas Riachuelo, smiled and waited for the applause to subside before speaking. "Just over a century ago, Kása and Macawia signed a treaty that officially declared the cooperation between our governments. In a world rife with tyranny and oppression, Kása and Macawia stand together as true champions of freedom and liberty. None shall ever drive a wedge between our two great nations. As a token of our friendship, over the next few days, Macawia's armed forces and industry will continue to, as they always have, help equip and prepare Kása's brave soldiers. Let it be known that for as long as our two nations continue to stand by one another's side, democracy and liberty will always triumph over tyranny." The audience broke into applause as Pasarinha and Riachuelo concluded their joint speech and shook hoof and claw, ushering in the continued friendship between nations."

pasakasa.8.t:0 "Three Rooms"
pasakasa.8.d:0 ""...and if you need anything, you can tell us tomorrow," the aged Zebra said as the small family looked around themselves at the apartment. The two foals had already found the window overlooking the sea, and were standing in front of it, pointing at the ships coming out of the harbor in awe, while their parents stood awkwardly in front of the mare that had greeted them upon their arrival here in Fyrport.\n\nThe last few weeks had felt like an eternity. After the death of their youngest had made Ohtríp and Tigele risk everything, even their remaining children, to flee the terrors of Barrad, they had set out south, hoping to reach that supposed paradise far away. After what had felt like a lifetime they had stumbled, starving and sick, out of the mountains, only to be met by soldiers. While Tigele had feared the worst and grabbed a rock, ready to fight, they had turned out to be their saviors.\n\nSpiriting them south, the Zebras had given them food and medicine, even carrying Ohtríp when she was too weak to walk, and in the end they had come here, to Fyrport, where they now were shown around the place where they were meant to stay by a zebra who had introduced herself as Karidadi.\n\n"Will we meet the others soon?" Othríp asked after a while, Karidadi nodding with a smile.\n\n"The others? Well certainly, there's meets every evening down in the town square there," she pointed out of the window to show them, "When you feel ready, please come down there, I'm sure you'll get along well with the others."\n\n"No ma'am," Othríp clarified awkwardly, "the others who will live here. There's three rooms, where are the other two families?" Neither Tigele nor Ohtríp  were arrogant enough to be presumptious. They could only remember their tiny hovel back in Barrad, where they slept together on the floor. Only the beds available was a dream come true, and they were mainly hoping to find out if their fellow inhabitants were good ponies. They could not have hoped to imagine the answer they were given."" 
pasakasa.8.a:0 ""There are no other families. All of this is yours."

pasakasa.9.t:0 "The Second Room"
pasakasa.9.d:0 ""But please, how has things gone for you here? Is everything to your satisfaction?" If it was one thing that they had learned while living here, it was that Karidadi was persistent. She came by once a week, without fault, and while they had long since realized that they were only one of many families they checked in on, she never ever seemed bothered or stressed for time. Watching her sip the tea they had prepared for her, Ohtríp and Tigele both wondered if they had done it correctly. They had long since realized she would not throw them out for a minor infraction, but old habits die hard. They still wanted to please her, thinking of her as their savior and their lord, and all the reassurances in the world did not easily shake that.\n\n"Everything is good." Tigelu reassured her. "We are still not sure how we were so blessed, and everypony has been so kind."\n\n"That's great to hear, but I must ask..." Karidadi said, leaning in. "You haven't used two of the rooms here in the apartment. I am not trying to judge you. I really do mean that, if you don't find a use for it, that's fine, I promise... but have you thought of a use for it?"\n\n"Well... I mean no..." Ohtríp admitted, shamefully lowering her head. "We have the kitchen, and it's such a blessing to have a room just for cooking, but we all sleep together, and we don't know what to use the other rooms for."\n\"Have you thought of making it a lounge?" Karidadi asked. "Make it a room where you can entertain guests." Neither of them really knew what to think of the idea, and Karidadi continued. "This is your home. You don't just survive here, you are able to make something good, something to be proud of. If someone comes by to visit you can take them there, and show them the best you have. You are going to build more than just survival here, so why not show off your accomplishments? Does that make sense to you?"
pasakasa.9.a:0 "I mean... I guess?"

pasakasa.10.t:0 "The Third Room"
pasakasa.10.d:0 "The first time you did something new was always awkward, but they were proud of the tableware set they had managed to get hold of. The entire notion had been alien to them at first, but they had felt like kings the first time they had invited some of their new friends over and been able to serve them tea and snacks from a matching set of cups and plates. They had pride in themselves, they had built something through their hard work. They had been able to go into the store of a fellow pony, speak with her as an equal and walked away with a beautiful set of porcelain. The set has cost them a lot, but when Karidadi came by and they could greet her in their new lounge, serving her tea from fine tableware, they both felt not just relived, but proud. They had something to show her, they had taken the chance given and truly delivered.\n\n"It is just... gorgeous!" Karidadi commented, "Is it a Fika Bon set? Or a Fixola? How much did it cost? Are you still able to eat properly?" she asked, smiling a little. "It's Fixola," Tigelu said proudly, glancing at his wife, who giggled.\n\n"We discussed it for three days. He really wanted to get Fika Bon, but well... that was just a bit too expensive.\n\n"You're right, I got myself a Fixola set myself. Fika Bon is lovely... but so is regular meals," Karidadi commented, sharing a laugh with them. "Also... I'm being silly now, but have you thought of anything for the last room?"\n\n"We're going to make it a room for the foals," Tigelu replied.\n\n"We thought of it when we were buying the set. If we're making all this for us, we want to give our foals something too. We managed to get a couple of beds for them off one of the neighbors. That way, we won't have to stumble over their toys, and if they want to have their toys everywhere... well, why not, as long as they can clean it up... are you okay?" Ohtríp asked, seeing the strange look on Karidadi's face.\n\n"Forgive me but..." Karidadi said, leaning in with an impish look on her face, "but might it be the case that you hoped for some privacy? Maybe a chance to give them a younger sibling?" she asked, leaving them both to blush furiously."

pasakasa.11.t:0 "Trip to the Gallery" #Flavour event about Pasarinha and his harpy friend travelling on a car to an event celebrating modern Kásan architecture. Should showcase just how far Kása has come in development and industrial progress before the car arrives to the event.
pasakasa.11.d:0 "As the motorcade streamed down Seguro's Mansu Erba Boulevard, Pasarinha stared out the window, admiring how far the city had come. It was a modern place, full of industry and commerce, but it had maintained it's old flair, and it was a city where children could still play in the streets without being worried for their safety.\n\n"We've come pretty far, haven't we, Bico?" Pasarinha turned to his friend Bicoafi, who was reading the morning news in the seat next to him. "Kása's changed a lot in the years since Erba retired." Bicoafi nodded, "And it's all thanks to you." Pasarinha scowled, "One creature can not be given credit for everything, I did not build these buildings with my hooves, it has been the work of all Kása." Bicoafi nodded and returned to his paper.\n\nAfter a minute in silence, Pasarinha spoke up again, "Say now, Bico, where are you taking me?" The harpy said nothing, "You said it was another architecture exhibition, but you refused to tell me what it was related to." Bicoafi sighed and set down the paper, "Always nosey you are, but okay. We're almost there so I'll tell you now. The Rosewood house is finished, and the architect asked if you could be there for the opening."\n\nPasarinha had heard of this building before, designed to be a new history museum in the heart of Seguro, it was a joint effort between an architect from Ilha Rosca and one from far off Wingbardy. Pulling up to the building, it really was a sight. Made of a rose-colored wood grown near Fyrport, it meshed both Wingbardian and Kásan architectural styles into a truly unique design.\n\nPasarinha smiled, now this was something he could be proud of helping to create. An effort of a modern nation, headed towards the future."

pasakasa.12.t:0 "The Rattle of Iron"
pasakasa.12.d:0 "Liza bounced down the stairs, swearing to herself. Of all the issues in life, she really hadn't expected the new bed to be one of them. It was a good bed, great even, but she hadn't counted on it being soft enough that she had actually overslept! Stupid soft bed and stupid warm coltfriend! Barreling out into the street, she dodged past the construction workers, yelling a 'sorry' to them after she nerely bowled one of them over. They really were working nonstop, weren't they? Then again it wasn't like she was going to complain, not after the new indoor toilets they just had installed.\n\nThe tram was just about to leave, and she yelled after them to wait, tossing herself onto the cart just before it departed. The conductor gave her a sour look as she patted her jacket down, trying to find the ticket.\n\n"You know I'm on a timetable these days, right?" he asked her, Liza bowing her head repeatedly to him. "You're a hero like Akeeku and Sinora Pon combined! Thank you so much for your understanding!" She managed to find the ticket in the end, giving it to him before she sunk down onto one of the seats. Stupid mornings...\n\nLeaning towards the window, she looked out across the city as it rolled by. This was her brief moment of respite before work, and she always counted the buildings outside. The old tram, pulled by ponies, had kept to a regular speed, but this new electrified one was way too fast. She didn't want to get to work that fast! Adding to that, all the new construction projects kinda made her disoriented. She'd usually been able to clearly tell how far away she was by seeing how run-down the apartments were, but now they all seemed all shiny and fresh, and she had to find real points of reference.\n\nHearing the bell ding, she realized she had arrived at her destination and shook herself awake, leaping off the tram and rushing towards the factory. Foremare her flank, she could barely supervise herself! And judging from the dry look the boss gave her as she galloped in through the door right as the bell rang, he probably agreed. Time to smile real nicely at him, maybe he'd even agree to let her go back to welding."

pasakasa.13.t:0 "Interesting Proposition" #Event where Pasarinha is presented with a tourism plan by the harpy. Target would be middle-class Macawian tourists initially and then potentially ponies from the River Coalition areas or even far-away Equestria. Pasarinha should be bit weirded of the plan but should be convinced when the unicorn chips in and points out how Kása is littered with ruined castles and untouched rural lands, perfect places to market.
pasakasa.13.d:0 "Pasarinha flipped around the set of papers in his hoof, it showed pictures of Seguro's long boulevards along with the beaches of Ilhas Lagosta and the mountains of the Fireshore. All painted with slogans about affordability and leisure wrapped into a three-page pamphlet.\n\n"So... what's the goal here?" Pasarinha asked, "I mean, I understand it in theory, bring in Macawian tourists to spice up the economy, it brings in more credit, boosts economic growth, etcetera. But you really think this is what the country needs?"\n\nPasarinha tilted his head to the side with a slight grimace and looked at the harpy next to him. Bicoafi nodded, "Kása is a land of raw beauty, both natural and creature made. It would be a waste not to use that beauty to strengthen our economic position, there are many Macawians, and even creatures from the coalition lands or Griffonia proper that would love to come to a place like this. In their minds, we are still a relic of the past, an artifact to be preserved regardless of our modernization. But we can exploit that perception to bring in even more business."\n\nPasarinha scowled, "This feels unethical. We're a new modern nation state, not a nature reserve for others to enjoy." Bicoafi nodded in agreement, "That's entirely true, but if we let them believe what they want to believe, what's the harm done? We have everything they could want for a vacation." At this, Eala spoke up, "We could even make use of some of those old Castles in the northlands, let them live like nobles for a little while. After all, isn't vacation meant to be like a fantasy?"\n\nPasarinha rubbed his chin, "Okay then. I'll bite, you can have your tourism plan. But remember, Kása must be proud to be Kása. Not a playground for foreigners."\n\nBicoafi smiled, "I would never disgrace my homeland like that.""

pasakasa.14.t:0 "Sunniest Seguro"
pasakasa.14.d:0 ""Mãe, Mãe, look over there!"\n\nThe dainty harpy girl exclaimed excitedly with a squeal, pointing her claw at the majestic statue that towered over all of the nearby buildings, proudly standing on its pedestal as it pointed towards the sea.\n\n"Yes Carlota, I can see it," her mother would reply nonchalantly, glancing up at the colossus before diving her beak back into the brochure that she clutched in between her claws.\n\nSo this was the statue of Sinóra Pon, she thought to herself before raising her head to look around. The ocean liner voyage had been rather stormy from Macawia to here, but to the family's surprise, it was as sunny as it could be here in Seguro. Now, as she patiently waited in the middle of this bustling plaza with her daughter for her husband and son to be done with scouring the marketplace for local delicacies, she quietly pondered on where to go next.\n\nThey had arrived barely a day ago, and there was already so much to see! They hadn't even begun trekking along the widest boulevards she had ever seen in her life when an old friendly zebra had given her this handy booklet, blowing her mind as she learned not only about Seguro's chic sights, but about the rocky verdant hills, crowned by the olden fairytale Wittenlandic castles, of Bymnonia. Oh they would see them all, she thought as she spotted her husband and his son Barcelos making a return, loaded with all sorts of delicious goodies.\n\n"Now boys, who's ready for a family picture in front of the statue?" she said enthusiastically as she traded her booklet for her travel camera, her two kids jumping in joy at the idea."

pasakasa.15.t:0 "Usual Work Day" #Narrative final event for Pasarinha's usual workday is interrupted when he is cordially invited to a dinner by his unicorn friend. He would protest a bit that he is far too busy and has an important meeting at the Chamber of Commerce that same day but his speech would be interrupted by a kiss from the mare. After she's left, he would buzz an aide and inform that today's meetings are postponed due to a cold.
pasakasa.15.d:0 "The record player sang in Pasarinha's office. New music this time, a genre born of Ilha Rosca's streets where he grew up. He liked the sound, it made his pen flow easier, he thought. More paperwork swamped his desk as the day ran short outside. Everyone had gone home by now, he could have probably passed this work off on an aide, but he enjoyed seeing them plan their evening activities free of the worries of their careers. He could shoulder this burden, alone, as he always had.\n\nPlacing some more tobacco in his pipe, he walked over to the window. The council building was once an anomaly, one of the largest buildings in its part of Seguro, but that wasn't the case anymore. Buildings taller than any Seguro had known a decade ago rose high into the sky, the signs of modern progress, the symptoms of Pasarinha's success. Looking down, he could see the lights of the bars and the restaurants that dotted the streets. Many of the creatures who worked for him were probably there now. His life wasn't a boring one by any means, he had volunteered for this, of course, but sometimes he wished for something... a little more.\n\nAmid his musing, Pasarinha was shocked into focus by a knock at his office door. Who could it be? No one should be here at this hour, he had always been alone at this time.\n\n"Come in." Pasarinha said with a stern voice and turned around to see who it was. As the door crept open, Eala entered, tonight she wore a bright red blazer with a black tie, she had clearly been somewhere important before coming here.\n\n"Eala? What a surprise to see you!" Eala smiled back at the zebra, "Should it be though? This is my office as well, is it not?" Pasarinha placed his pipe down, "That it is. So what's the occasion for you coming back to your office, hours after you left it already, in an entirely different set of clothes?"\n\nEala pulled back, surprised at Pasarinha's impunity. "Well, I got a new bottle of Whiskey from Fyrport this morning, and I was planning to go out on the town, find a nice restaurant, and down it. And I was maybe looking for someone to come with me?" Pasarinha, stern as ever, shuffled through some papers on his desk and replied, "Sorry Eala, I have a meeting with the chamber of commerce early tomorrow morning, and while you know I can hold down my alcohol quite well, it wouldn't be good to show up to the meeting with a hangover. And plus-"\n\nPasarinha was cut short by the feeling of Eala hanging over his right shoulder, unsure of what was going on, Pasarinha nearly froze up when the mare planted a single kiss on his cheek.\n\n"I'm not taking no for an answer. I'll be in my car outside, come and join me. Preferably soon."\n\nThe mare exited the room, leaving the shocked first commander with his smoldering pipe. When he finally broke the spell put on him, Pasarinha rushed to his personal residence in the building, threw on his nicest suit, and began to canter outside. But he paused as he passed the room of his secretary, knocking quickly he spoke to the young zebra in a hushed and raspy tone, "Tell the chamber I can't make the meeting tomorrow. I have uhh... a cold, yeah."\n\nAnd as Pasarinha lept into the car with Eala, this young secretary looked out his own window and chuckled, "I guess Pasarinha finally found a life for himself. Good on you.""

pasakasa.16.d:0 "The Kása Free State has always been an odd nation. Situated beyond the Free Towns of Gryphus, it has been home to various escaped slaves and serfs, and to most it has been largely irrelevant, at least historically. In recent times though, it has grown rapidly under the leadership of two figures; Mansu Erba and later on Pasarinha. Under these two leaders, Kása has become a strong enough presence in the far east that they can no longer be ignored.\n\nA dispatch has arrived from Seguro - the Kásan capitol, where they are formally requesting for Kása to be allowed into the Concordat. They are no strangers to war, and have beaten back both crusades and Austurlander raids before."

With each passing day the amount of documents, requests and notes that landed upon his desk seemed to grow ever larger. But when the letter from Asterion had arrived, he had decided to put it all aside for a day once he'd read its contents: Kása had been formally approved into the Concordat. This news was wonderful. Not only did it secure Kása's position militarily, it also opened wholly new markets for Kásan companies. The letter also invited him for future meetings with the minotaur officials regarding further treaties and miltiary cooperations.\n\nHis officer door slammed open with a crash, followed by hearty laughter as Bicoafi entered. "Truly wonderful, Pasarinha! This will be a boon for us all!"\n\n"And how did you catch these news," Pasarinha questioned with a solemn look. He hadn't made an official announcement yet. But the harpy waved his claws and huffed. "My friend, you don't cancell meetings without a reason. Not a hard guess for a bird like me."\n\n "For once, Bicoafi's boast isn't just sweet words," said Eala, also entering into the room. But she came carrying a gift; a tray with three glasses of sparkling wine. Soon, they all clang glasses together with smiles."
pasakasa.17.a:0 "To a valuable partnership!"

pasakasa.18.d:0 "Pasarinha could only stare the letter upon his desk, head hunched and his teeth gnawing the pipe in his mouth. His mood was foul, and it gnawed him deeply. A rejection. This had not been part of his calculations. Asterion had no reason to deny his overtures. None whatsoever. By all estimations both sides would've benefitted from Kása's entry into the Concordat.\n\nSo why did they reject them, then?\n\nThe clock on his desk rang; he didn't need to look to know he had a meeting to attend. So, Pasarinha stood up and grabbed the letter. As he walked towards the door, he passed by the fireplace in his office. Some embers in it still shone with warmth. The zebra crumbled the letter and tossed it at the coals before leaving. He didn't look back to see the letter catch fire and burn to ashes."

### Yrmthu events

yrmkasa.1.t:0 "Our Harmony"
yrmkasa.1.d:0 "As Yrmthu took her place in front of the Advisory Council, she felt as if the floor would collapse under her. The high of the campaign had worn off and she was now feeling the burden of her office. Did Mansu feel that way too? She didn't ponder on this. There was a speech to be made. Probably one of the most important of her career.\n\n"Dear Councillors\n\nOne of the great beauty of the Free State is that we do not rule according to precedent. When the First Village was founded, there was no old monarchy. No ancient tradition to follow. Rather, we had to innovate, to think over the way we do everything and dare I say, we are a regime of humble philosophy, in its most pure and simple form. We answered those initial dilemmas with an ideal of a communal spirit, one of a shared burden to safeguard individual liberties in a bleak world.\n\nSadly, this ideal has waned. Faced with crisis, we answered with urgency. Mansu Erba, our dearest Avo, answered the call and so, the tragedy of the Xatisa was mitigated. But as the Pentarchy refused to end their horrific abuse, mitigation, pragmatism and crisis management ceased to be an exceptional response. They became the norm. The fences of the refugee camps became walls. Go to Oferclif-Retorno and you'll see it. The border separating so-called "refugees" and "Oferclifians", dividing, nurturing conflict and grievances. These calcified artificial borders weren't planned but they produce hardship without end regardless. And in such a divided society, we have become more selfish and greedy.\n\nI wish for the next years to be about abolishing these borders, abolishing these divisions. Not by decree but by the communal spirit which gave meaning to Kása. Not from the top but from all corners of society in understanding that there is no unique answer. Only together, as friends, can we hope to succeed.""

yrmkasa.2.t:0 "Who Has the Power?"
yrmkasa.2.d:0 "Today, the Advisory Council voted a new bill. While it was heavily debated upon and it seemed at first that it wouldn't pass, First Commander Yrmthu personally involved herself in pushing it through the legislature.\n\nThe law's main aim was to empower local township assemblies. However, while such actions are nothing out of the ordinary in Kása, the significant change is that the transfer of power was not done through deconcentration but through devolution. The law envisioned no administrative oversight and no national-level method to overrule the decisions passed in the local townships. It was even more surprising in that it ran counter the centripetal trend that had occurred under Mansu Erba. One amendment in particular puzzled many in Seguro which would set up a commission to study possible redistricting of major cities to divide them into parishes acting as independent political units.\n\nWhile some grumbled openly or under the cover of anonymity, the law was lauded by councillors hailing from smaller villages and remote townships."
yrmkasa.2.a:0 "The people must be able to decide on their own local matters."

yrmkasa.3.t:0 "The House in the Dirt Field"
yrmkasa.3.d:0 "For years now, Fyrportians had to walk to the city center only to have to go through a vast field of dirt, now filled with trash and broken bottles. In the middle of it was a lonely house belonging to Old Eutímio. Way back, he had defied a real estate firm from Seguro who wanted to build a new fancy neighborhood. He was the only one who didn't sell and so, the company broke ground, filling the streets of his youth with debris. In the end, it was all for naught. The company went bankrupt and nozebra bought back the project. And now, it was just him and the dirt fields.\n\nSo when he heard that the city council had opened a new town hall where citizens could freely put up motions to debate, he dusted up his fanciest suit and joined. The town hall was quite lively with topics ranging from market organization to policing and daycare management. He quietly waited for his turn and finally suggested that the field be transformed into a park. He didn't expect much but the attendees and councillors picked up on the idea as the land was available. Not a whole lot of funds were on hoof however so the public suggested volunteers to at least start clearing the debris. Eutímio was a bit miffed, thinking it would be the end of that.\n\nAnd then, it all happened very quickly. The city made a call for volunteers and rather than the expected dozen, more than a hundred came to help with the works. Old Eutímio wasn't the only one to hate the eyesore dirt fields. Soon, the fields were cleared and began to spring up. There a lot more meetings to discuss a fountain, a picnic area, a gazebo or even an open-air amphitheater.\n\nNow, Old Eutímio's house was still the only one around but rather than only seeing the few depressed commuters, there were families enjoying themselves, couples going for a walk and the usual obnoxious youngsters finding ways to rebel amongst the trees. Lonely, he was not anymore."

yrmkasa.4.d:0 "Leofsige stopped on the side of the road to catch his breath and wipe his forehead. The weather had been awful, with the heat and humidity of those times before a storm. Yet, as he looked on he saw the blizzard being on its way. Spirits forbid, they would get a heatwave the next day. He remembered the tales of his mother, about how the weather hadn't always been like this, that there was such a thing as seasons back when the Five didn't rule yet. Maybe. But what was the point of thinking about that? He still had to go out to gather roots in case the meager crops failed again.\n\nAfter a small moment of rest, he was nearing Stánincel when a cloaked pony ran into him, sending both of them tumbling down the dirt path. He cursed and turned towards the idiot. He let out a small gasp when he saw the face revealed by the cloak. That of a tattooed unicorn, one with a strange thing that resembled a gem over his eye. When he opened his eyes, the gem lit up, looking like an eye. Believing he had ran into a Pentarchy officer, Leofsige threw himself to the ground, letting out a litany of unintelligible apologies. But then, the unicorn simply looked around and seemed embarrassed to have scattered the content of his root bag.\n\n"I'm sorry. I don't have time to help you with that. I need to... Oh and after all Tartarus with that!"\n\nHis horn lit up and he magically put all the roots back in the bag.\n\n"There!"\n\nNot adding anything, the unicorn ran down the hill. It took a moment for Leofsige to react. That was the last thing he had expected to happen. Then some guards arrived, angrily asking if he had seen anypony. Leofsige, in a reflex he didn't quite understand himself, pointed towards another direction, sending them in a rush. He collected his bag and fled towards the village.\n\nThere, there was much agitation as a slave of the Pentarchy was trying to remove posters while the crowd was pushing him around to better see what he was trying to put away. The posters were signed with what they said was the Kásan emblem: the white sun on a black field. The poster was warning of liberation and the end of the Pentarchy's tyranny. "Be brave. Be ready. Have hope. We are coming.""

yrmkasa.5.d:0 "As she took her seat in the Advisory Council, Yrmthu could sense the tension in the air. As she looked at the councillors, she could notice the outrage in some of their eyes. She recognized the feeling. That gnawing feeling of being ignored in matters that concern you, of being bypassed in favor of others and fearing to have any power slipping from your hooves. The only difference with the forgotten Kásans and refugees was that they weren't ignored. They were just representatives. What mattered was who they represented. But to truly go forward, it needed to happen in good faith, not in petty revenge.\n\nAll of that, she explained as well as all the choices she had made in previous months. She explained the success of the local assemblies in the new tasks that were given to them and how she wished to expand upon them. Change was on its way in Kása\n\n"What I am saying, honored councillors, is that I believe that we need to have a dialogue, not one restricted to the confines of this room but a frank and open discussion between all Kásans. I am no Queen and it is time that we address the similarities between my office and that of a monarch. We need to go back to the spirit of Kása, that of a communal and decentralized democracy. This is why I hereby announce my intention to call upon a Congress of Kása, composed of you and representatives from all communities. Its task shall be to revise our fundamental laws and reform the way the local assemblies, the Advisory Council and the office of the First Commander share their power. In the meantime, I will issue a decree to clarify the management of current affairs by all three institutions. Our laws give me broad authority in this matter so when the Congress is finally called, do make sure to take back some of it from me!""

yrmkasa.6.t:0 "Sunshine Over The Mountains"
yrmkasa.6.d:0 "It was cold in Dunburh. Yet, Leofsige felt so happy he could have cried. When the posters began to appear, he had chosen to believe. And now, even as that Kásan flag flew over the old castle, he had trouble believing it. And yet, it may have been the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. But he had to hurry. The messenger had told them all back in Stánincel that there would be something important happening in Dunburh today. The Kásan leader would speak there and he knew he would have to be there.\n\nAs he arrived to the city, he saw the entrance being guarded by a group of soldiers clad in simple dark green uniforms and caps. A curious bunch. Griffons, harpies, zebras, ponies and even a deer. As a reflex, he tried to keep a low profile as he neared them. Then, he held his breath as one of the soldier hailed a group of fillies but he only proceeded to give out some candy and chocolate. As he stared, the deer offered him a bar which he took without a word, too dumbstruck to thank them. And he walked in\n\nIn the city proper, he walked the streets. There was a buzz in the air as the locals were throwing out anything that reminded them of the Pentarchy's rule. Images, flags and the rest. All left in the dirt. As he made his way towards the center, he began to unwrap the chocolate. The first bite caused him to stop. It was so good he wondered how anyone could ever eat anything else. He kept savouring the bar so much he had failed to notice rioters angrily tearing down a gallow.\n\nFinally, he got to the city center. There was a stage. He remembered it as the place where the rulers would speak. He had not come alone. The place was absolutely crowded. There were soldiers maintaining a line around the stage but without shouts or violence. Then, she came and for a brief moment, Leofsige felt as he could fall in love. The Kásan leader wasn't a zebra, or a griffon or a monster as the Pentarchy had told them but one of them. A simple pony. She even had the same facial tattoo that they all had.\n\nThen, she spoke.\n\n"Barradians. Brothers and sisters.""

Of course, it didn't mean the end of every problem. The mountains were near uninhabitable and no refugees would be able to move back to their ancestral land for a long time. Others were still arriving.\n\nAnd yet, it was indeed over. And while to some it seemed like an anticlimactic end, an unsatisfying last page of a long book, now they could turn the page on that chapter of Kásan history. There was still much to do in this world."

yrmkasa.8.t:0 "The Opening Ceremony"
yrmkasa.8.d:0 "The Congress. At last. Yrmthu couldn't help but feel giddy since she got up in the morning. She had dreamed of this all of these years and now, it was finally happening. As she entered the room, she felt strange. They had to rent the whole Seguro opera house and neighbouring academy of music to house the general assembly and the committees. Rather than walking in the austere walls of the Council Hall, she found herself walking the planks of a scene. She liked the idea that the Kásan democracy would be reinvigorated in such a place of beauty.\n\n"Dear Kásans,\n\nIt is with pleasure that I wish you all welcome in Seguro. Even if we have yet to write a single sentence of our new constitution, today is in a historic day. It is difficult to describe how long of a journey this has been for so many of us, for Kása as a whole. Could anypony imagine just five years ago when the greatest issue on the table was a budgetary adjustment on the bread dole in the camps of Oferclif-Retorno that we would convene in this beautiful opera to transform our country? But I digress.\n\nEach and everyone of you today is tasked with a great responsibility. Through crisis and misery, Kása has been forced to shelve many of its ideals, to wait just a little bit for the clouds to go away. Today, we stop this. In the next months, we will discuss and review how best to restore the communal spirit of Kása and from it shall emerge a truer democracy, one in which everypony has a place and a say, in which the smallest town of Bymnonia is equal to Seguro or Ilha Rosca, united in friendship rather than under a central authority. This is will be difficult but I trust you all to make us proud.\n\nI hereby declare the Congress of Seguro open.""

Among the methods used by the Guild was a contract with local assemblies to provide rent-controlled housing for families and colocation deals for younger ponies, free public transportation passes, language lessons, mentorship programs and, with personal participation of some donors, a program of lending suits for job interviews.\n\nMeanwhile the Oferclif-Retorno local assembly is happy to report that for the first time in decades, the population of the refugees camps has neither rose or stagnated but actually diminishing."

yrmkasa.10.t:0 "To Make a Home"
yrmkasa.10.d:0 "For a long time, northwestern Bymnonia had been a marshy region but that was all somewhat kept in check. When the Barrad crisis occured, many Kásans fled south, fearing the corruption of the Pentarchy spreading southwards. And sure enough, much of the abandoned land became marsh again, though scientists dispute that the swampification was magic-induced.\n\nWith the help of the Oferclif assembly, other communities and the Guild of Charity, many refugees but also destitute Kásans were given the opportunity to resettle those lands. The effort has proven both successful and popular. In a much shorter time than expected, marsh clearings camps made way to crops and houses being built. The participation of the Guild of Charity also helped in unexpected ways, creating contacts and networks to help the settlers finding buyers for their products beyond the borders of the Oferclif community.\n\nAnd now, there are talks of recognizing some of these new communities as townships in their own right."

The Congress of Seguro had succeeded in drafting a new constitution and she couldn't have been prouder. The congresscreatures had truly followed her vision, that of a free and decentralized confederation. When she saw the first draft, it was hard to realize that that simple document contained such an immense step forward for Kása but it was all in there. The Advisory Council and the office of First Commander would devolve powers to the local assemblies, empowered to decide on the majority of issues while the First Commander would be tasked with foreign affairs and military matters. For its part, the Advisory Council would become a forum for discussion between local assemblies and the link between the First Commander and the local level. The only the caveat in the document was that of article 101 that stipulated that should the confederation be in vital danger, the First Commander could step in with approval of the Advisory Council to enact emergency changes. The Committee for that chapter of the constitution had called it the "Avo Rule" in honor of Mansu Erba's salvatory leadership. But that was anecdotal. It truly was a Coltpernical revolution.\n\nBut it was finally time to speak and conclude the Congress.\n\n"Esteemed congresscreatures,\n\nOut of the darkness of the Xatisa, we have finally emerged and what a sight. It is morning in Kása. In harmony and friendship, you have written a marvelous document. One that will change the course of our history. Not since the days of the First Village did we ever change the rules we live by in such a dramatic way. You have honored the Kásan spirit and I could never congratulate you enough for this. I wish there was more I could say but in a way, I feel I have spoken enough. It is time for others to speak up.""

She didn't even know how she had gotten so angry. Or rather, it was difficult to pin down a reason when there were so many.\n\nFor a while, she had thought to have been happy. Her ideological program had been adopted. The constitution had been embraced. But it became increasingly clear that it was adopted in its letter. Not its spirit. She wanted localism to be intertwined with a spirit of community beyond borders and friendship. Instead, the local assemblies were building walls. Walls of pettiness and revenge. The smaller communities rather than be freed and enjoying their new powers were being bullied by larger towns in exchange for advantageous deals and city-centric infrastructure plans. In Fyrport and the western communities, fear and concern over the Gryphussian exiles and the situation on the other side of the border had led to the dismantlement of civil liberties. In Oferclif, the local assembly was evermore divided over the damn question of the name of the city, with the older population being bitterly opposed to motions of renaming the city to Retorno. Bickering. Dissatisfaction. Division. But no friendship in sight. \n\nField Marshall Lobu was warning her of a danger of violent clashes in some places. She was trying to pour water on it all but the fire wasn't showing any sign of stopping to burn. Finally, at one o'clock in the morning, exhausted, she finally came to terms with what could be needed. The Avo Rule. Not even five years in. She would try, one last time to solve it another way but she feared that there was no alternative. Or rather, there were. Many bloody ones.\n\nAs she left in the middle of the night, Ymrthu once again passed in front of the large painting of her predecessor. She turned to it. She shamefully remembered that she had gloated in front of it when she had returned from the Congress of Seguro. But this time, there was no gloating. Only silence and the grave motherly stare of Mansu Erba. And this time, all of the stress of these last few weeks came rushing to her."

Diplomatic cables from Macawia had stacked ever since the upstart mountain mare had been elected into office. Many were afraid of the new Kásan leader's agenda but some of the demands he was getting were more than a little bit ridiculous. Silera Medu had eased him a bit, assuring him that no, the election hadn't been stolen by a Wittenlandic plot. But still, even discarding some of the most alarmist fantasies of his boss, there was room for concern over how little. In the end, he opted for confronting her.\n\n"Allow me to be blunt, First Commander. To many in my country, it feels that the way you are conducting the country is to pursue endless fantasies while we foot the bill. You must understand that few in Macawia enjoy the idea of paying for your army and investing in your countries only for you to shut the door in our beaks."\n\nSilera tried to intervene, suggesting some options for reconciliation but the First Commander shushed him and smiled to the ambassador.\n\n"It is far from this. I do understand the concerns of your countryharpies, I can assure you that there is no malice in this. In fact, part of my reasoning for these policies is over making sure that our partnership remains sustainable. You have to understand how much the Xatisa has burdened the Kásans. Local economies were hit and destabilized. Taxes had to be raised while we were forced to seek to survive rather than simply live. I think you may have noticed that while imports for Macawian goods did increase, there has been less demand for goods with higher added value. The reason is, we cannot afford them. We need sometime to rebuild our economy and make sure that we can provide for ourselves. It is a shock therapy but one that will render us able to actually keep trading with you. Otherwise, you'll be stuck with a partner only interested in raw goods. We want trade, not charity. And I believe your business sector would rather be paid by customers rather than thanked by charity beneficiaries and trust my personal experience in this, so do we.

Name calling became the order of the day with some councillors coming to blows and being escorted out of the Council Hall.

There is only one word fitting for this occasion: shame. Shame on you. Shame on those who bullied others. Shame on those who used their newfound powers to settle scores and oppress others. Shame on all of us. You have failed Kása, you have failed your communities and you have failed yourselves."\n\nThe outburst caused many to freeze and stare in silence. Yrmthu seized on that moment of silence.\n\n"We were supposed to collaborate, to find common grounds despite our freedom to do things our own way, in a spirit of friendship. Yet, I have in my offices reports of violent group being ready to settle some scores between communities through force. What kind of friendship is that? What kind of communities can be built on that? We need to fix this. To learn to become a community again. This is why, in face of this vital danger to our democracy, I have decided to activate article 101 of our confederal constitution."\n\nThere was an immediate cry of outrage from many councillors. Some who she even called friends lobbed insults of "tyrant" to her. She didn't back down. She knew that in their heart, they knew too. She turned towards the senior councillor.\n\n"Speaker!

yrmkasa.15.d:0 "As plans for the future Horsford School of Spellcraft and Alchemy moved forward, the government was finally faced with a major dilemma: who would run the school? Considering the importance and stakes of such a project, it was important to find a creature who would both be able to appropriately teach and oversee the cursus and be above any suspicion. After much consideration, four names were selected.\n\nThe first option was Obsidian Shine. The Barrad-born veteran was a member of the Skapatoria Program and personally responsible for helping many refugees escape the madness of the Pentarchy. A unicorn himself, he advocated for a discipline-based approach who would see magic users be taught to dominate themselves first and foremost.\n\nNext on the list was Tendazi, a Fyrport-born zebra, and a well-known fixture of the charity works in the region. In an opposite vision to that of Obsidian Shine, she would see the students be raised in a culture of magic use that would foster natural restrain, altruism and mental balance. The fundamental problem of magic, she argued was the culture of unethical competitiveness and elitism that plagued Wittenland.\n\nNext up was Fahim Alhifaz, a foreign expert from Maretania. The stallion envisioned the school cursus through a completely different paradigm. To him magic wasn't to be viewed as an integral part of unicorns and other magic users but rather a force to be treated through a scientific lense. He would focus the cursus on safe use and a strict safety-based methodology.\n\nFinally, the last name was that of Lígia Ramedi, cousin of the former First Commander candidate and an academic. A sociologist by trade, Lígia was no magic user herself but was a renowned expert of the socio-cultural aspects of magic use. Despite her credentials, the main argument for her nomination would be that of the need for proper "mundane" oversight over magic users."

yrmkasa.16.d:0 "Back when Yrmthu envisioned the idea of the School of Spellcraft and Alchemy, much thought was given to a proper location. In the end, the committee tasked with ironing out the project settled for Horsford, an old Wittenlandic castle located near the Barradian border. It was abandoned entirely during the Barrad crisis and became a symbol of separation between safe Kásan territory and Barrad afterwards. It was seen as a good symbol for the new school. Transcending the Wittenlandic legacy in a true Kásan fashion, in an idyllic scenery and yet close to where the Pentarchy committed its crimes. It was perfect.\n\nThe castle was refurbished to have modern accommodations for the students. The Wittenlandic past of the castle proved useful as several rooms were already available and ready for magic use in different forms though they were modernized too with input from Fahim Alhifaz. The main court of the castle was demilitarized and made into a recreation area and a memorial dedicated to the victims of the Xatisa and the Pentarchy as a constant reminder of the consequences of magic at its worst. A vast garden and carefully designed magical forest reservation were created around it. However, all strategic plants and magical entities were restricted to a magical greenhouse designed by Tendazi and other Kásan alchemists. An old collapsed mine was also transformed under supervision of a Diamond Dog team to reveal crystal deposits and serve as a study ground for crystal-based forms of magic.\n\nUnder advice from Obsidian Shine, an interdiction zone was established around them to isolate the school from the local population. However to prevent any disruption in the region, the Ramedi cousins were sent in to the nearby village and in-depth contracts were signed with nearby communities to ensure smooth cooperation and jobs."

His parents had been a bit afraid to hear about him going to school so close to their old homeland but what happened there was over and school was mandatory. The young unicorn sat back in his carriage to watch his travelling companions. The zebra Amílcar and the griffoness Lucyna were in a deep discussion over their book of alchemy and they didn't pay much attention to him. Meanwhile, on his side was Godiva who looked uneasy. Of all of them, she was the only one not born from Kása and to her, it seemed as if going to that school was a punishment. He wondered if his parents felt the same way when they were settled in Retorno. He decided he would help her once they were there.\n\nFinally the carriage arrived at the castle. Leofdaeg was in awe. Everything was so beautiful! It felt like one of those castles out of those fairy tales! As they entered, they saw as stacks of papers and books flew around the place. Their guide explained to them jokingly that it was last-minute paperwork which caused Lucyna to pout. "Doesn't feel all that magical now", she quipped while Amílcar kept staring the magical bureaucratic process as if he was going to burst from excitement. As they walked across the courtyard, they passed by a monument all in black obsidian. The Barrad memorial. Leofdaeg noticed who Godiva was terrified by it so he took her hood and smiled to her: "It's alright. You're with friends!". She relaxed a bit and smiled back, albeit slightly.\n\nFinally, they were brought to a magnificent dining hall filled with. The four of them were seated on a table with two other students. One was a deer much older than them, Ingvar as they would learn, with a sour look on his face. No wonder. Leofdaeg had read about creatures like him. Older magic users mandated to go back to this school to get a magic license. The other was a cheerful looking zebra mare named Cássia who was wasting no time to devour the plentiful dinner they had been served. And it was indeed delicious.\n\nThen, silence fell on the hall as the teachers entered the stage in front of them."

I'm sure you will find it very agreeable and you will have all evening to enjoy yourself much. However, before all those pleasantries and delicious treat can begin, I will ask you all to listen very carefully.\n\nChildren, and older creatures of course, there is evil in this world. Now, sure, there is the usual suspect. The slavers, the big bad dragons, the knights of Opinicus. There are thieves and tyrants. But this is not the evil I'm talking about because that evil is here. In this very room. Within you. Within me. It is the dark seed within our heart that leads us all to the worst paths out there. In most creatures around the world, the seed can prompt you to murder, to steal, to lie. But to us, it is different. For we have a magical talent. A magical talent that allows us to do much but also allows that seed to fester and grow to what some call unimaginable horrors. But they are very imaginable. Right outside these walls, there are black stones on which are written the names of those who saw those horrors and were killed by it. One could sulk about it but we're not here to do that.\n\nUnder my tutelage, you will learn magic but most of all, you will learn to suppress that seed. You will learn to control it, to never for even a moment become a slave to it. If you learn that lesson, your life will be as normal as that of the worker. The only reward is knowing that nopony will have to add any new names to those black stones out there.\n\nEnjoy your meal.""

Now drink that up or I'll have to put on a cask on this leg and that would be simply too ghastly!"\n\nThe griffonness held the pony down to prevent him from squirming as he drank the potion. She wasn't exactly honoring what one would imagine to be the traditional motherly and caring attitude of the nurse. But she had to admit that it sometimes got in the way of helping some creatures getting out of their own way to heal.\n\nThe change was surreal. She remembered Lucyna back when she entered the Horsford school of spellcraft and alchemy. The griffonness had no interest whatsoever in any form of magic that didn't feel, well magical. Despite her lack of abilities to cast spells, she wanted magic to make things happen in fantastical way. Then, she started to learn about alchemy and how it could do things that were certainly more subtle but could nonetheless change a creature's life.

Few incidents are to be reported and many testimonies of alumnis show satisfaction with the school.\n\nSecond point is the security evaluation. Ramedi identifies few points of concern. Expected tensions between students of the new and old territories have been lower than expected. Ramedi points to military-related matters as a major cause of fights among students and recommends against any military-oriented change in the curriculum.\n\nThird point is the relationship between magic users and non magic users. Despite some initial issues and distrust between some students and school staff, particularly Ramedi herself, incidents have become rarer occurrences. Ramedi particularly details the numerous myths invented by skeptical students regarding herself, pointing out that many students identified her as a villainous character analogous to novel antagonists. The non-occurrence of any villainous storyline involving the school director seems to have caused a gradual warming of relations.\n\nFinally, the report includes a lengthy analysis of the burgeoning ties between the Horsford alumnis and teacher and the Kásan economic sector. Reports have shown that with the move away from the traditional magic practices of Barrad, Wittenland, Austurland and Kása, students have become more innovative and focused on practical matters. Such innovation have caught the interest of teachers and non-Horsford civilians. The school has become involved in helping these so-called "spin-off" partnerships.

yrmkasa.27.d:0 ""Councillors. Thank you. With this document being signed into law, we can begin the healing process of society. In our quest for freedom, we forgot that true freedom cannot be bestowed upon. It needs to be achieved."\n\nThey murmured in agreement but the moment didn't feel triumphant. It was all needed but fixing mistakes rarely feels as triumphant as brashly committing them. There is much less adrenaline in this.\n\nAfter some further discussion, the clerk took the document to go and registering it. The Councillors followed and soon, Yrmthu was alone in that small meeting room in the Council Hall. She got up and went to the window to look at Seguro. It was a beautiful day. A bit too much, almost as if the nature was nagging her over it all. She sighed and pondered.\n\nThe document was solid. This time she was sure of it. The local assemblies would maintain their status and mandate to safeguard local and direct democracy but their affairs would be regulated by laws and decrees voted on by the Advisory Council and First Commander, tasked as they would be with maintaining peace and harmony. This Second Free Confederacy of Kása was perhaps not as idealistic as she had hoped for but it would work and it would open the way for a truly harmonious society, one where Kásans would learn to be friends anew.\n\nShe turned to the table to put back her documents in her briefcase and noticed some newspaper. One of them with a picture of her. She picked it up and stared at it for a moment. Then, she erupted in laughter, one uncontrollable and frank laughter. As she laughed and laughed, Yrmthu dropped the newspaper to the floor, its front page and title clear for anyone to see."

yrmkasa.28.d:0 "As she stepped on the front of her family house, Yrmthu couldn't help but feel a little bit nervous. Not only was that house not the place she grew up in but she hadn't seen the family since election day, swamped with work as she had been. Then, the door opened and her mother rushed to greet her.\n\n"By the spirits, Yrmthu! How good it is to see you! Come in, come in!"\n\nBefore Yrmthu could utter a word, she was inside with her mother fixing her mane and asking her if they were feeding her well enough at the Council Hall.\n\n"Mom..."\n\nEventually, their mother settled down and after some long discussion and a good bottle of wine, the family gathered for dinner. But she noticed how her sister's seat was still empty. She knew that the mare was shy and didn't join family gatherings before dinner.\n\n"Where is Wulfrun? I thought she would be here."\n\nYrmthu's father seemed a bit embarrassed.\n\n"She left for Barrad a few weeks ago. She told us she'd visit you in Seguro in a few months but yes, she left."\n\nYrmthu seemed surprised.\n\n"Why didn't she say anything? It's dangerous! Even with the work being done, that place is still filled with monsters and freak storm! She should have told me! I'd have arranged for something. I can't believe it."\n\n"I think that's why, dear. She said she wanted to visit the old country like her ancestors would have. We tried to talk it out of her but she made up her mind. You know how she never felt like she belonged here. She always felt the five monsters had stolen something from her. So she went to get it back."\n\nYrmthu sat back, feeling wrong. She had worked so hard to make a home for themselves. Yet, she couldn't make one for her little sister.\n\n"She's proud of you, you know that right? She listened to all of your speeches and she was grateful of how you helping giving her back what she lost."\n\n"What about you? Are you also going to leave?"\n\nYrmthu's parents and siblings looked at each other. Then her mother spoke.\n\n"No. There's nothing for us back there. Your sister felt like she was. But that's something we've all learned and that we know you have too. It's there, in all of your speeches, in all of what you did.""

As hard as the studies were, he couldn't be happier with his choice - it beat a dreadful life as a serf under the Pentarchy a thousand times, and his enthusiasm for a new path in life paid off. Today, he was the top graduate in all of Horsford.\n\nA mere few hours after the ceremonies, the unicorn was suited up and made his way towards the forbidden third floor in the East Wing for a meeting he was invited to right before graduation, an invitation which surprised him greatly - and he gasped in surprise once again when he arrived.\n\n"Professor Alhifaz?"\n\nThe Maretanian horse was alone in the office and the eager attitude his students knew him for was gone, replaced by a calm exterior.\n\n"Take a seat, young stallion," Alhifaz stated. "I will be brief. Maretania, the nation I come from, has a need for talented mages like you, and it is why you are here." He placed his amulet onto the table - which his students always saw him wear despite not knowing what it meant.\n\n"I work for the Containment and Security Initiative. It is a worldwide operation of trained mages, based in Mareib, tasked to defend creaturekind from danger, often without their knowledge. I'm sure you remember all I've taught you about the safe use of magic - but, alas, not everyone follows the same creed. Artifacts and magical items left unattended are a source of great danger, and there are many across the world who seek to wield them for nefarious gain. This is where we come in, and intervene to set things right."\n\nHuddled on the chair, shocked and baffled, Lightning Strike barely managed to mutter a question. "And... what would I do..?"\n\nAlhifaz broke his feigned coldness briefly, striking a smile. "Not be afraid, I hope - you'd serve with creatures just like you. Travel across the world to find magical artifacts, secure them in time, figure out exactly what makes them tick... What do you say?""
yrmkasa.34.a:0 "That sounds... really cool!"

### Áltu Kexa events

altukasa.1.t:0 "The Visionary Madgriff"
altukasa.1.d:0 "Áltu Kexa had long pondered about what that meeting would look like. In her fight for freedom, she would need allies beyond the usual calls for Macawian help and Jan Brązowy was among such potential allies. But was he capable? She was gambling a lot on such a meeting.\n\nWhen the griff known as Jan Brązowy entered the room, Áltu's doubts dissipated. She could not take her eyes off him. The griff was tall but made thin by a harsh life. She appreciated the finer details of his person. The mess of his feathers. The calluses on his claws. The dirtiness of his clothes. And yet, the burning determination shining through his tired eyes. To the average onlooker, Jan could pass for a mangy beggar, a very dangerous mangy beggar. But a poet knows to look further and what she had in front of him was a walking tale of legend.\n\nAfter he sat, she discovered that Jan was a griff of few words. After a small exchange, he bluntly got to the point.\n\n"There are only one reason someone of authority would ask to see me. They want something and it's usually to arrest or kill me. Your guards didn't take my sword so I guess it's a third option. So. What do you want?"\n\nShe usually didn't enjoy the most laconic people but there was something about that griff.\n\n"You and I see the world in the same fashion. As a place in which tyrants rule and in which there is a need for creatures with enough courage to cure them of their gout by the proved medicine of execution. Until now, Kása was a place for the mild abolitionist but now that a new era has begun, I need creatures like you to give us an edge. I will get you weapons, supplies, training for your younger recruits. Enough to make the proudest knight of Opinicus sweat. What do you say?"\n\nThe griff didn't answer immediately and scratched himself nonchalantly."
altukasa.1.a:0 "One thing. What took you so long?"

altukasa.2.t:0 "Liberation"
altukasa.2.d:0 "Aethelwine walked through his field outside of Dunburh. He sighed as he stepped through the black barrad dirt. A cannon shot thundered in the distance. He turned back. Dunburh Castle was on fire. He had heard someone back in town complain about it but really, could it happen any other way? For decades, this castle had been the source of all that had gone wrong. So why not burn it? It's just stones and mortar. And sure enough, when the Kásans came, when the Pentarchy died, the serfs rushed to loot it and set it on fire. And the Kásan artillery had been happy to contribute. Another cannon shot.\n\nBut Aethelwine wasn't sure if he could join in on the fun. Why celebrate when you had already been robbed of everything? The Pentarchy had stolen his crops, his money, his family, even her cousin when they tried and fled to Kása.\n\nCannon shot.\n\nHe looked on to his field and the other ones in the distance. All black or gray. Even as the music and laughter resonated in the distance, the sight of those fields was overwhelming him. How long would it take to clean the evil magic from these lands? To purge the air of everything that polluted it?\n\nCannon shot.\n\nAs he looked on, he noticed a ragged Pentarchy banner, stuck on a bunch of rubbles, flying pathetically in the cold wind before finally snapping and flying in the distance. He thought about tomorrow. What hope was there that things would just go back to normal in an instant? How could so much hardship be erased? What if it couldn't?\n\nCannon shot. A castle collapsed followed by thunderous stomping of hooves.\n\nAethelwine dismissed those thoughts and sat in the dirt, taking a bottle of wine out of his bag. Today the Pentarchy was dead. Today, the source of their suffering was gone. Today, they were free. And that was enough to celebrate."
altukasa.2.a:0 "If only for today."

altukasa.3.t:0 "One Quiet Day"
altukasa.3.d:0 "Áltu adjusted her coat as she walked along the dirt path. The wind was cold and incisive so far north in Barrad. She had been joined by Field Marshall Solano Lobu and Jan Brązowy. Neither were talking. Despite the victory, there was no mood to laugh or chat when it came to such. They passed upon oak upon oak as they climbed up the hill. In each of them, a servant of the Pentarchy was hanging, gently pushed around by the wind. There was no other sentence for those who helped the five monsters blighting Barrad for years to come. Aside from the soldiers, the three of them were alone in the hill. No cries nor angry yells for the sentenced. They died alone and in silence. Finally, they reached the top and saw the hill chosen for the group execution. Áltu then spoke. Quietly.\n\nNorthern trees bear a strange fruit\nBlood on the leaves and blood at the root\nBlack bodies swinging in the Northern breeze\nStrange fruit hanging from the oak trees\nPastoral scene of the Destitute North\nThe ruined land and the blighted earth\nScent of lonely daffodils sweet and fresh\nThen the sudden smell of burning flesh\nHere is a fruit for the crows to pluck\nFor the rain to gather\nFor the wind to suck\nFor the sun to rot\nFor the tree to drop\nHere is a strange and bitter crop"

altukasa.4.t:0 "Nóbu Livru Programa"
altukasa.4.d:0 "While Mansu Erba had many flaws, she had many achievements that were commendable. Among them was the Livru Program which had put books in many hooves throughout Kása and helped improve literacy. As a poetess, Áltu understood the importance of literacy. How much the spoken word could affect and even change lives.\n\nHer whole life had been affected by it. She still remembered fondly of how it exposed the flaws of the Wealthy, how it got her in jail, how she convinced her jailor to support her and how, well after she got out of jail, the two of them fell in love. Even after the well-known, the written word helped her husband to grow as an individual, leading him to get into academia and even to become a university teacher, despite his late awakening.\n\nHer life was proof of how a brutish jailor and a simple farm filly could grow to become leaders and erudites. If there was one thing that Kása's civilian government ought to do, it was that."
altukasa.4.a:0 "Let us read!"

altukasa.5.t:0 "Áltu Reads"
altukasa.5.d:0 "To celebrate the success of the Nóbu Livru Programa that had seen so much success, Áltu travelled to Fyrport to go and read a book in a local elementary school. She didn't care much for that kind of feel-good public relations events but still, she went.\n\nAs she entered the classroom, she stopped for a moment, admiring the room. It was all so different from the life back on her village of the Ilhas Lagostas. She had never gotten the chance to learn in an actual school. Instead, her parents taught her how to read to the best of their abilities. The rest, she had to learn on her own. All those little ones would never have to know the struggle. And that. That brought tears in her eyes.\n\nBut enough daydreaming. She had a book in her hooves and the little foals and fillies around her were waiting on her to start reading. She smiled and indulged them.\n\n"Upon the open oceans so vast,\ndid the vessel ride called D'Vash.""
altukasa.5.a:0 "May there never been another filly robbed of the joy of reading."

altukasa.6.t:0 "Ignorance is the Building Block of Tyranny"
altukasa.6.d:0 "During her numerous talks with Jan Brazówy and other foreign volunteers, something that had struck Áltu was how frequently the ruling elites had used ignorance to help entrench their own power. Then, when the Advisory Council debated a matter of literacy in Kása in her presence, she couldn't help but wonder. Of course, Kása was no tyranny but could it be made into one should the written word go on as a luxury? This question haunted many of her nights.\n\nAnd so, after long consideration, she asked her administration to draft an extensive plan to root out illiteracy in Kása forevermore. The plan would include an extensive program of mandatory readings that included the history of Kása, accounts of victims of oppression in Barrad, Austurland and Gryphus and philosophical works on the ideal of liberty."

altukasa.7.t:0 "The Kexa Contest"
altukasa.7.d:0 ""You made this happen, you know? I'm proud of you."\n\nÁltu's husband smiled to her, causing her to melt in addition to blushing in front of many Kásan officials. The goof always knew what to say but the clapping and stomping of hooves began just before she could answer. She turned to the stage to see a wide range of little students making their way to the front.\n\nOne by one, they began to read their poems on the thematic of freedom and liberation. Some had chosen to focus on the war of Barrad. Others had chosen more personal or abstract takes on the topic. Then one read a poem that turned out to be an ode to her and how the student was looking up to her. While Áltu had often heard praise, to hear them in such a form from a filly like her felt strange but also incredibly flattering. But it was the last one that really touched her. It was written from a little chick whose parents had brought her from Brodfled, fleeing the civil war and the famine. How much she loved Kása but felt ashamed to enjoy its beauty while she knew that her cousin and grandmother were still there, where every day was a hardship. She wanted to share her freedom but couldn't put it in an envelope. And for that alone, it made the whole fight to create this poetry contest worthwhile. To put words on the struggle and suffering, the importance of their fight, that made all the difference.\n\n"You may be proud, my love. But I'm prouder of these little ones.""
altukasa.7.a:0 "Even if their rhymes are atrocious."

altukasa.8.t:0 "To Bury the Hatchet"
altukasa.8.d:0 "Áltu was waiting in the meeting room next to her office. She felt nervous. The last time that they had seen each other, it hadn't gone well. There was something about Yrmthu that just felt wrong. But now. Now, Barrad had fallen and Áltu couldn't help but feel that Yrmthu had been right. She had rushed into this and many suffered as a result. She didn't regret anything but she felt that yes, she could have done better. She could see what Mansu Erba in her times had seen in the Wittenlandic mare. And maybe that was something she needed too.\n\nFinally, Yrmthu arrived. The reception was cool but she sat down. There was a bit of polite small talk but they quickly got to the heart of the matter.\n\n"I guess I should thank or congratulate you. For breaking the Pentarchy."\n\n"Thank you Yrmthu. It was my honour."\n\n"It's not about your honour. It never was. It's not a performance, First Commander!"\n\n"It wasn't an act. I am no slave to public relations!"\n\n"That's not what I mean by the spirits!", Yrmthu sighed, trying to regain her composure.\n\n"It is about what came next. What you should have planned for. The Xatisa. It happened once, of course it happened again. What, you thought that guns and cannons end things? They are only the beginning. You don't know how hard it was down there in the camps. But I know. I saw it. I sweated through it. If it hadn't been for Tendazi and I, it would have been worse!"\n\nÁltu sighed and lowered her voice: "I know. And for this, I apologize. You were right. I now know as much."\n\nThe response silenced Yrmthu who stared at her dumbfounded.\n\n"I failed in this. And I need your help to make it better. So tell me Yrmthu, what should the First Commander do?"\n\nShe quickly recovered, her anger gone.\n\n"The camps are swamped and the fact they stayed there were already part of the problem. We need to resettle those people. Help them create communities. We have so much unused land. We should start there. The cities just can't expand housing fast enough. They'll need help. Equipment. And a cooperative effort. No government commissioner. Either refugees or private leaders."\n\n"Then let's do it.""
altukasa.8.a:0 "Together."

altukasa.9.t:0 "The Little House in the Swamp"
altukasa.9.d:0 "The visit in the new community wasn't very easy. The road to the new refugee community in northern Bymnonia. The location had been chosen by the local assembly of Oferclif with Yrmthu's input. It was one of those lands that was known to be farmable but that had been abandoned in the early years of the Xatisa. Too much fear over a possible attack had caused many to flee. Once thriving lands devolved back to swamps but armed with state-provided equipment and sheer commitment, groups of refugees and Kásans were colonizing back these lands.\n\nThe visit didn't go as planned at all. The community didn't look like the plans and Áltu who had insisted on a small scale visit had to resort to asking around with her aides. In the end, they were brought to a place where "Mother Tendazi" lived. As they walked through the camp, Áltu couldn't help but notice how inspiring it all was. The creatures here were happy despite the hardship. Perhaps there actually was something to Yrmthu's wild campaign ideals. One other thing that was sure was how popular "Mother Tendazi" was. People kept asking them to transmit her thanks for this or that, usually about the "box of biscuits" or the "infusion".\n\nThen, they finally got to it. Tendazi's home and a small wooden house in a swamp. It was all a very picturesque place. In front of the small home, there was a group of locals, young and old chatting and playing cards. The door was open so they simply entered. Inside was a true small living room that resembled more that of a comfy cottage than an emergency infirmary. Then, the old zebra mare known as Tendazi appeared.\n\n"Oh dear! Madam Kexa! We thought you weren't coming till tomorrow. I'm so sorry. We have nothing prepared!"\n\n"That's quite alright, miss Tendazi. I'd rather have you focus on your commynity than on my comfort. You have quite an assortment of goods here. It almost feels like a store."\n\n"It is true, madam Kexa. I know about your opinions regarding material wealth but it helps. Creatures don't just need to be healed and fed. They also need the small things. The little pleasures. A small tea. A biscuit. The occasional bar of chocolate. A comfy chair. If you don't treat the morale of the locals here, making them feel at home, they might as well have stayed in the emergency housing of Oferclif."\n\nÁltu was a bit miffed at the slight but the mood in the camp was showing that the mare may have a point. So she smiled back at Tendazi who relaxed a bit, showing the fatigue in her eyes. She asked: "Would you maybe like a cup of tea?""
altukasa.9.a:0 "I would."

altukasa.10.t:0 "Nóbu Retorno"
altukasa.10.d:0 "As she walked to the neat little red ribbon, Áltu looked around. How much the little swamp village had changed. She still remembered her last visit where it was nothing but a sea of tents and wooden sheds. But now, it felt like a true small town. She couldn't believe it took so little time, as if it all happened in a book written by a laconic writer who cared little for filler chapter.\n\nThere were several delegation who had helped the project since the early days. Yrmthu and her friends. Mother Tendazi who had overseen the construction and management of the colony. War veterans, representatives from the Barrad communities and from the Oferclif city council. And many others. She couldn't help but smile. This. This all felt right. But it also felt like it wasn't just her moment. No, it was more. Áltu smiled and waved Tendazi and Yrmthu to come and join her. They both hesitated but eventually joined her and together, they cut the ribbon, causing a raucous applause and stomping of hooves.\n\n"With this, I declare the official entry of Nóbu Retorno among the recognized townships of Kása! May it live a long and joyful life!""
altukasa.10.a:0 "Hurrah!"

altukasa.11.t:0 "Meaning of Wealth"
altukasa.11.d:0 "It hadn't been easy between the wealthy elites of Kása and Áltu Kexa. She had never liked them and few had in return. Of course there had been times of hypocritical cooperation but it had always been with clenched teeth. And sometimes, it got vicious with some even accusing her of being a closeted Prywhenian agent, dedicated to Marksist-Stallionism.\n\nAnd yet, somehow, they had adapted. Rather than continuing to flee to Macawia, the Riverlands or elsewhere in increasingly ridiculous ways, most had stayed and started to contribute to the Cause. Donations had been up, especially towards the war refugees.\n\nThe newspaper had even reported something impressive. A zebra mare named Fatela had announced her creation of a charitable foundation dedicated to vaccination and disease eradication. It already seemed like the new organization could have some real leverage too with the roaster of foreign experts joining it, including Griffonian figures such as a Katernian former knight and several Yale universities alumni.\n\nIn a more surprising move, Fatela had announced her intention to change her will so that upon her death, most of her fortune would be distributed to various charities. She vowed that her children would only get a tenth of her current fortune, which by all accounts would already be a comfortable sum."

altukasa.12.t:0 "New Worker"
altukasa.12.d:0 "Anastacía made her way into the factory. There was a lot of work to be done today but for once, she didn't feel all that worried about it. It would go fine and there wouldn't be "voluntary" overtime. Really, the days of the strike were well behind them at the Wingalac factory. She still remembered those days. How they fought for basic things and how they had managed to catch the attention of the candidates. There had been quite a bit of disappointment back then. But in the end, it worked out.\n\nThe mare stretched herself after the current load had finished passing through her on the assembly line and waved at her union representative. She smiled. There was a good mood in the air which made her think. The recent reforms and collective bargaining had changed things. The bosses were already thinking twice about tightening pay or demanding extra work since the election but as Crazy Kexa went on, they had gotten scared and began to implement changes spontaneously. A break room appeared. Then a factory mess hall that actually served palatable food. And some other things. And when Crazy Kexa began to make deals with the unions and even organized the worker-soldier battalions, well, the bosses made sure to not cause problem. It was probably in their best interest really. When faced with a moody mare, you don't turn your back on her and you make sure she doesn't notice you. And it works whether she has a knife or the full might of an entire state apparatus in her hooves."

altukasa.13.d:0 "Aethelwine took a long breath. Oferclif's market was buzzing with activity and he loved every bit of it. Back in Barrad, even when the insane weather was somewhat clear, few dared to just go about their lives without a care in the world. Not with the Pentarchy's goons out and about to collect or press some into servitude. But that was all over. The Pentarchy was gone. Barrad was far away and now, he was in Kása. It was decades but he finally did it. \n\nHe still remembered the first attempt to flee Barrad alongside his cousin, years ago. Wassa had told him tales of Kása and they had finally gathered the supplies and will to try and cross the border. They had made good progress but then, it all went to Tartarus. The storm. The patrol. The collapse of the bridge. He still remembered Wassa falling, calling for him. He never found her body. But now, as the Kásans had finally brought an end to their misery, he had decided to go and see that place that her cousin died to see.\n\nHe was looking around when he heard a faint cry from the crowd.\n\n"Aethelwine?"\n\nThe pony turned and froze. He had seen a face he didn't see in a long time. It was his cousin. It was her. She had changed. Got older and had a scar all across her forehead. She dropped her groceries, pale as she had seen a ghost. Then, as tears came to her eyes, she yelled:\n\n"He's alive! By the spirits, he's alive!"\n\nThey rushed towards each other and hugged, incapable to let go as some were turning to look at the scene."

altukasa.14.t:0 "Unjust Revenge"
altukasa.14.d:0 "Áltu Kexa was resting in her room at the Hórnavik Cape Hotel, the dreadful document waiting for her on the desk. She looked down to the city. Now that she was there, she had to admit that it was all quite pretty. Peaceful even. When a bunch of cheerful little fawns playing in the streets passed below her window, she let out a painful sigh. Why, she wondered. Why did the world have to be this way? Why was so much beauty built on suffering? Why did righting those wrong had to be this bloody? Why did it rest upon the shoulders of the freeminded creatures to wage war, revolution and destruction to bring about a better world? Perhaps it was a trick from those who benefited from oppression to entrench themselves? To make peaceful reform impossible. To make their downfall so painful that those who would seek it would be brought down to their level, enough to make them think twice.\n\nShe turned back towards the desk and the papers on it. They told of a bitter story. Of how freed thralls had struck out from their relief camps, sought the hold of their oppressors, burning it down and killing the noble family and their remaining servants. And the details. The horrid little details. It was hard to conceive yet spoke much of the pain and misery that had been inflicted on them. How many horrid little details did they had to endure that went without reports?\n\nAnd yet.\n\nShe took the document and signed it. This was Kása and in the land of freedom, one does not ascribe to the rule of the angry mob. One does not condone extrajudicial killing. A society that would allow wanton murder, even as a revenge from grave offences, was not free society. And so, even in these terrible circumstances, they ought to be punished for their barbarism so justice may emerge in these lands."

Her husband was off to Macawia in an academic trip and her children were all away to study or work. The days felt long out here alone. She couldn't write. The inspiration had gone. Too much worry in her head. As for sleeping. Well.\n\nShe continued and made her way to the front garden, sitting there on her wicker chair. Unlike that of the First Commander, it was much more comfortable. She closed her eyes and inhales the pure air of the isles. She listened as the crickets and the birds chirped, how the gentle breeze blew. She sighed. Why couldn't all be as simple and gentle as this?\n\nEven here, in the most happy of places, she had trouble lifting this burden on her shoulders. With every news coming, with every soldier or Skapatoria agent dying, with every refugee rescue operation failing or succeeding with some loss, it became harder. Was there ever an end? To the bloodshed? To the suffering? To the oppression? The nightmares and sweats late at night? The anger?\n\nShe was tired of being angry, of carrying the torch forward. Yet, she had to. This was hard to bear but to bear others still living in slavery and misery was harder still. He whole life she had denounced the hypocrisy of those who would give out a little to the cause and yet lived in luxury. If she stopped it all, what would it mean?\n\nBut that wasn't the worst part. What was worse was the anger of others. Of those tired to fight. Of those who complained that Kása was losing its ways in its crusade for freedom. Of those who still went on and on about the need to pause and finally solve the refugee crisis that seemed neverending. But at least, they had someone to blame. Someone to shift their burden to. But they too were free because Sinora and Akeeku listened not to the meek. Rather, they thought so that their descendants may afford to forget and fool around like entitled foals.\n\nShe remembered her mother back when she was writing those rhymes that threw her in jail. How she worried about her daughter sacrificing her future and chance at living a comfortable life. "What about it, Áltu? How will you gain money?", she said again and again.\n\nÁltu opened her eyes."
altukasa.15.a:0 "I don't do this for money, mother."

altukasa.16.t:0 "Quiet Commemoration"
altukasa.16.d:0 "It was a strangely beautiful day, Áltu thought as the procession made its way to the center of the memorial. Her husband was helping her carry the wreath of flowers. She watched left and right. Rows upon rows of slabs carved from white marble. Upon each of them, name, rank, dates and places carved in the stone and highlighted with sand. She liked that. Even if Kása fell. Even if the war was forgotten, these would still be there and a simple wash followed by some sand would reveal what these stood for. Yet, it felt only like a balm on a still aching wound. There were so many of them...\n\nThey finally arrived to the monument. An obelisk, made from stones from each region of Kása, each liberated land for which Kásan blood had to be shed. And surrounding it, a field of gravel, grounded from the same marble as the funerary slabs, symbolising those who died from oppression or died to fight it in anonymity. They placed the wreath at the base of the obelisk. Then, the families followed while Áltu took place on the side.\n\nFinally, it was time for her to speak.\n\n"My fellow Kásans,\n\nOurs is not a happy fight. There is no laughter in the roar of cannons and the screams of guns. There is no glory in bloodshed nor is there in the last words one utters in the bloody dirt. I wish I could say those we lost died with a smile but there is no truth in this and truth we owe them.\n\nWhat is true is the duty. The duty whose call we all answered, loyally and to the best of our abilities. For we did not vow ourselves to our cause for the promise of loot or grace of kings but so other may laugh or cry, play or toil, not as slaves or preys but as free creatures with the same rights as their neighbours and leaders.\n\nThis is why they took arms, carried their bags days and nights and charged through the field of duty against bullets, hexes and shells.\n\nWe may honor them today with marble and flowers but more than these mere temples, each breath a freed slave takes is its own monument to their sacrifice. And they will do so for centuries to come.""
altukasa.16.a:0 "They are still with us in spirit."

altukasa.17.t:0 "Tea Break"
altukasa.17.d:0 "Áltu put down her pen and stretched herself. The cicadas cheerfully chirped in the grassy plains near Ilha Rosca. She smiled and looked on to see her husband reading in his chair while the children played hoofball in the garden. She had missed those moments. There was joy in such simplicity, away from the buzz and worries of the city.\n\nBut there was more than that. So many times, she had left the city to find refuge here only to be unable to write or rest. So often did the chains of ruling slittered their way even here. But now, things were better. The camps in Oferclif were slowly dismantled as ponies found their way to other cities. Literacy had improved. Poverty had diminished. And so many other things.\n\nThere were still fights to be fought of course but it seemed as if Kása was finally back on tracks. It felt as if history had turned in this part of Griffonia, no longer simply the home of ever increasing oppression.\n\nShe grabbed her cup of tea, blowing on it to cool it down. She slowly inhaled, savouring the smell of tea and the gentle sea breeze. Then, she smiled. Finally, for a beautiful afternoon, it felt right to step back from it all and enjoy a moment with one's family."
altukasa.17.a:0 "Kása will be alright."

altukasa.18.t:0 "Change of Pace"
altukasa.18.d:0 "Almost overnight, like a change in the wind, the Pentarchy of Barrad fell. With them ends one of the greatest burden that laid on Kása's shoulders. And while we may rejoice, there is still a bitterness. A sense of failure in that once again, we are forced out of our part in our future while the decisions of others decide our fate. Yet, we can hope that this was for the best, that maybe it is a change of direction in eastern Griffonia, one towards a greater liberty rather than more oppression.\n\nDespite this, we have still more to do. The mountains remain uninhabitable for the most part and our duty to the refugees does not change for we will never force them out. And while this is a victory, much remains to secure freedom and peace for all creatures in this part of the world."
altukasa.18.a:0 "Our duty for harmony must continue on."

altukasa.19.t:0 "Of Vocal Chords"
altukasa.19.d:0 "Áltu was resting on the porch of her home, looking at the distance. Her throat was still sore from yesterday's speech. She knew that it was important to give it but it didn't make the pain go away any easier. Her husband interrupted her internal grumbling by bringing her a platter with some cantor syrup, a few biscuits and a thyme infusion. He then sat next to her with a slight mischievous smile on his face.\n\n"What?"\n\n"Didn't say anything, dear."\n\nShe cleared her throat before grabbing the cup and snapped back: "Cut it out. I know you and you never smile like that if you're not hiding something."\n\nHe chuckled as she coughed and started sipping her infusion.\n\n"Alright then. I've hired someone. A flutist."\n\n"Did you now. I didn't know the university needed background music.", she said wanting to laugh but trying not to.\n\n"No, though I will take that idea to the rector. It's for you."\n\nShe stared at him, puzzled. Why on earth did he think she like the flute so badly as to have a private flutist, now?\n\nHe continued: "I've seen your speeches. And, dear, I say this with all the love in the world but the way you whip yourself into a frenzy, well, it makes for powerful speeches, sure, and I know it's all from the heart but you're making mistakes when you're angry and worse, you're hurting yourself. You have some tells. So I've hired that flutist to stay on the sideline during your speeches so he can play a few notes when you lose yourself so you know when to pause and collect yourself."\n\nAltu was taken a back for a moment. She tried to answer but didn't. Puzzled, she simply finished her tea. She pondered for a moment while he crumbled a biscuit to throw some pieces at the bird. After a few seconds, Áltu smiled and started giggling. It made her throat hurt but she didn't mind.\n\n"You know. This is why I love you.""
altukasa.19.a:0 "You're the only who ever manages to shut me up."

altukasa.20.t:0 "The Tartarus of Fundraising"
altukasa.20.d:0 "Áltu sighed before downing a glass of the finest sparkly Westkeep. She used to enjoy those Aquileian beverage. In good company that is. But there she was, at the opera house of Seguro, surrounded by the wealthy elite of Kása, trying to get donations from them. Oh, she knew how to handle it of course. Fundraising and dealing with socialites was part of a famous artist's life and she was no average artist but she loathed every second of it. She had brought an assistant, one of Pasarinha's old aides, who knew the Kásan business world quite well.\n\nThe assistant brought her to meet a couple of wealthy factory owners. One could think they would make something interesting but no. They made boxes. A lot of them. And they were doing quite well for themselves, enough to be able to fund several Xatisa programs or new equipment for the Barrad campaign. But much to Áltu's dismay, they were even more plain and empty than the boxes they shipped. The wife had been talking about the proper choice of new chairs in her Asterionese winter residence while the husband explained that he enjoyed collecting rare books as an investment but cared little for reading. Finally, as she contemplated smashing her own head with the nearest bottle of Westkeep, the Aquileian wine got the better of her and she laughed to a "joke" before telling the couple: \n\n"You know. I feel we all ought to take inspiration in you, darlings. To be uncluttered in one's mind. Such simplicity can only allow us to filter so much things out."\n\nÁltu's assistant glared at her like he was about to die from apoplexia but Áltu simply smiled and waited. After a few seconds, the businesspony simply giggled and agreed, making her unsure if she should enjoy the display or scream out of frustration. Her assistant quickly pointed to some other zebra and quickly rushed her away from the couple before Áltu could get a chance to tell them off. He proceeded to then try and give her a rundown of whatshisname's line of work."

altukasa.21.t:0 "Like Stealing Candies From a Chick"
altukasa.21.d:0 "It was very early in the morning in the Seguro harbour but it was anything but quiet. After First Commander Kexa had announced her intention to forcefully extract funding from the wealthy elites to fund her liberation campaign, fear spread among the rich like wildfire. Of course, the administration had anticipated so and had immediately froze any transfer of capital away from Kása. In preparation of the inevitable attempts from some to evade taxation, the customs administration of Seguro had called Iwan Celnik from Fyrport to oversee the reinforced controls.\n\nIwan took a long puff on his cigarette as he watched his griffs and zebras controlling the luggage of those who tried to get aboard ships. Here and there, some fools were trying to sneak aboard but you could tell that few. He smirked, thinking how much easier it was than trying to control the Gryps-Süd GmbH goons from smuggling banned goods in Fyrport.\n\nThen, he noticed an altercation near a ship and decided to get down there to see what it was all about. He arrived to see a couple of sharply dressed zebras trying to move obviously heavy luggages\n\n"What seems to be the problem here?"\n\nIwan's subordinate explained that the pair said that they had nothing to report and were refusing inspection of their luggages. The zebra intervened and rambled on, saying something about how the laws of Kása guaranteed them privacy and he would not be bullied by government goons. And if they tried touching them, they would hear from his lawyers. He then took out a Macawian passport, arguing that he had rights as a Macawian citizen too. Then, after the rich zebra said his piece, smugly looking right at Iwan, he tried to grab his suitcase and lift it. The heavy suitcase rose very easily though with a very audible rip. The bottom had given up, revealing a neat little pile of gold bars.\n\nIwan took another puff from his cigarette as he looked at the zebra, then down at the gold pile and then back up at him."

altukasa.22.t:0 "A Vacation in Lavýrinthos"
altukasa.22.d:0 "As he made his way towards the little cottage, Silera Meru wiped his forehead with his hankerchief. Oh how he hated the Asterionese climate. Always so dreadful, even off-season. But thankfully, he wouldn't have to dillydally here for too long.\n\nWhen he neared the cottage, he was welcomed by a small crew of unfriendly looking creatures. Strangely diverse too. A few zebras, some ponies, a pair of griffons and even a yeti. As he talked with their leader and introduced himself, he exchanged a long look with the yeti. How far from home he was too.\n\nWhen he entered the cottage, he was welcomed by a trio of creatures. Two griffons and a minotaur. His contact, Alexandrescu, smiled to him and offered him a seat. The conversation was rather open. Alexandrescu explained that he had acquired several Storm Empire leftover guns from his employer in Tobuck and that his friend, introduced as Arrreola, would complete the delivery with Sicameonese guns though he wouldn't say their exact origin. The minotaur didn't introduce himself, simply pointing out that he was there to ensure that no funny business would happen, lest Asterion would be forced to prevent the trade from occurring in their national waters. There was little appetite in the minotaur isles for distraction from Cyanolisia after all and Kásan wars certainly counted as that.\n\nDespite their reassurance, Silera felt uneasy. If the press back home ever caught wind of the dealings, it would cause a national scandal, nevermind the suspicion of a Gryps-Süd GmbH connexion that would arise later on. But, they needed the guns. So he agreed. He got up and took the phone, calling a third party to signal: "How clumsy from me. It must be the rum from yesterday. Wrong number!" and hung up.\n\n"The transfer has been made to the Fezeran account."\n\n"Excellent!" beamed Alexandrescu. "Time for some refreshment. It is quite hot today, yes?"\n\nA servant approached with a tray of cold beverages wet with condensation. Silera rushed to grab a glass and down his cold lemonade."

altukasa.23.t:0 "All The Little Hooves"
altukasa.23.d:0 "The collection of guns from the population went well, better than expected even. Of course, what came out of it was less than uniformed. Some were hunting rifles or simple leizure small arms. Others were ancient. The more modern ones were usually offered by Brodfeldian and Gryphussian exiles or former thralls who stole them on their escape with the help of Skapatoria agents.\n\nOthers. Others were special. One elderly zebra in Ilha Rosca brought a special package to the collection office of the city. Inside was a sword of Griffonian style, still embedded with an oath of loyalty to the Groverian emperors albeit crossed out and more recently engraved with the word Liberdadi. The old mare proceeded to explain to the officer that it had been a trophy taken by her ancestor at the battle of Ebyron Hill. Their family then used the sword in every war Kása fought since, almost losing them during the Austurlandic invasion. And now, she felt like it was better the sword went back to the fight, even if it meant the last time.\n\nÁltu had been informed of the donation and immediately asked to see it. Holding it, she was overwhelmed. Even if she felt a bit strange in feeling the same sentiment told by books about reactionary knights and their oath sword, she did understand the powerful symbol this was. And so, she awarded it to Field Marshall Lobu in replacement of his service sword."

altukasa.24.d:0 "If there was one figure that vexed her, it was the head of the civil service, that tedious little stallion that was Lûa Ramedi. From the very start, he had annoyed her. It was not a good start for him when he had challenged her, preaching his hollow status quo policy before the people of Kása. To think their positions might have been reversed... staring him down as he stood before her, as unperturbed as a rock, even as she could see the wheels spinning inside that shrivelled little head of his.\n\n"You don't like me," she told him. It was easy enough to figure out. He only raised an eyebrow in response, asking what she meant. Áltu Kexa felt a twinge of anger at the display. "Drop the act, Ramedi," she snapped. "I know what you're playing at. You've stymied me from the very beginning. You bury my administration in minutiae, you tie up effort in meaningless quibbles and you keep playing your game as if Mansu Erba is still there. I get it, the fact that I beat you must sting, but the people chose me, no matter whether she groomed you to replace me or not. My question to you is whether you really are going to keep undermining me, even when you pretend to be so professional.\n\nLûa Ramedi slowly sighed, removing his glasses and rubbing the bridge of his muzzle. It was the first time Áltu Kexa had seen him react, but she had not expected what followed.\n\n"With all due respect ma'am..." he asked, as calm as before, but with a voice like ice. "I am head of the civil service, and that 'minutiae' you talk about is my job. You carried the election, yes, but will fire and brimstone create roofs over the citizenry's heads? Will angry rhetoric put bullets in your soldiers' rifles? I have not undermined your administration at any point, unless you consider bruising your ego when you fail to provide proper leadership 'undermining'. Those 'meaningless quibbles' is how you keep Kása running, something your predecessor saw. That is why she strengthened the civil service like she did, and if you wish to change that, then fire me, make this my Night of Fire, and replace me with a sycophant who will value your ego above the nation's well-being. Otherwise, please allow me to go back to work and provide more than merely style in your leadership."

He used the monster's threat to catch a breath but soon it was back on him. There was no counter-attack this time. He focused and generated a shield, focusing all the power of his horn. It stopped the monster but didn't deter it. It pressed. Obsidian had to put a hoof down. Monster was not giving up. For Spirits' sake! Why couldn't they get more cowardly the more corrupted they got!\n\nThen, in the distance, a shape with wings appeared, flying straight towards them. Great. That pesky beast had a friend. He braced, ready for impact. Perhaps he could still teleport away? No. He didn't have it in him anymore.\n\nThen, the newly arrived creature struck. But he felt nothing except relief. He opened his eye, watching the monster hiss, scratch and struggle while a griffon with messy feathers was hacking away in its back with a broadsword. It was his chance. Obsidian dropped the shield and struck the beast at the neck. It shrieked one last time and fell.\n\nHe had to stop a moment to catch his breath then turned to the griffon who had saved his life. He recognized him from that newspaper article from a while back. Jan Brazówi, the madgriff.

Now, the influx of new refugees is causing shortages and overcrowding. However, there are already private and local initiatives to mitigate the damages. Among them is the newly created Barrad Relief Fund, a charitable organization under the leadership of former candidate Yrmthu and Tendazi, a leading figure in public health and charity works in Fyrport.

kasa.30.d:0 "We have been approached by Kása with a quite interesting offer. Though our history has been somewhat fraught, the Kásans have suggested that since neither of us hold much in the way of imperialistic or expansionist ambitions, maybe it would be mutually beneficial to ensure each other's security, and be ready to come to each other's defence if needed.

### General flavour and political events

kasa.38.t:0 "The Pequenos Príncipes Grumble" ##triggers at start of election process
kasa.38.d:0 "In the days following Mansu Erba's resignation, many took the news with sadness but some quietly lashed out behind closed doors. These critics saw the whole idea of resignation as poor form and bad precedent. To them, it is essential for a First Commander to act until their death and anything less would be short of dereliction of duty. Some even worried of the consequences of the coexistence of two first commanders.\n\nAmong those critics are the Pequenos Principes. Those families descendant of former tribal nobility sold into slavery became a fixture of Kásan society. Early on, those freed slaves swore to relinquish any claim to power or privilege. Instead, they turned to cultural work, acting as archivists, historians and particularly funeral directors. Since the creation of the role of First Commander, they played an important ceremonial role in the transfer of power as the funerals of the previous First Commander traditionally coincided with the nomination with their successor. Therefore, a cynical rebuttal of their critics would be that Mansu's resignation effectively meant that the Pequenos Principes would have no participation in the ceremonies.\n\nThose complains have failed to gain any popularity however. After all, everyone in Kása knows that Mansu Erba's venerable age means that her death is near anyway."
kasa.38.a:0 "Let her enjoy her twilight years."

kasa.39.t:0 "A Light On The Lakeside" ##Mansu Erba's death in 1010.9.16
kasa.39.d:0 "Mansu Erba's death prompted many in Kása to call for countrywide mourning and a great funeral, but those calls were quickly silenced. It was announced that in her final wishes, she requested to not be buried with national honors but rather have a small private funeral. She was to go on a pyre outside of Segura, by her family country home next to a small lake.\n\nWhen the day came, the Pequenos Principes had prepared everything to make sure that the pyre would be well-prepared. All of Mansu's family had come to assist. However, when the time came for the pyre to be lit, a stream of creatures slowly made their way towards the home. The family quickly recognized a lot of them. They were Mansu Erba's "netos", the freed slaves who Mansu had saved during her days as a Skapatoria agent and their families. The Pequenos Principes directing the funeral scrambled to try and prevent the newly arrived from disturbing the ceremony and upsetting the mourning family. However, as one of them turned to the husband of Mansu, he simply gestured to let them come. And so, one by one, they came to put flowers next to the unlit pyre to say goodbye to the zebra they owed their freedom too. Zebras, ponies, griffons, deers and so many others. Soon, it became clear that the Netos did not come alone. Many more had heard the rumor and came too. Refugees from Barrad and Gryphus but also simple citizens. Those others Kásans however did not join Mansu's Netos. Instead, they remained on the shore of the lake opposed to the lake and put their flowers in the water, gently pushing them away.\n\nIt took a long time for the procession to end and the night was falling when the pyre could at last be lit. Mansu's widow was supposed to lit the fire but, overwhelmed as he was, he couldn't and so, her children took his place. When the flames of the pyre started to rise, all could see on the hills nearby small lights appearing. First some and them hundreds and hundreds of little lights in the night, hundreds who came to accompany the Avo di Kása, their grandmother in her final journey."

Hasek obeyed, instantly dropping down and beginning to do his pushups, not stopping - though he did look up - when he heard the sergeant yell. "General!" Looking to the side, he saw how none other than General Solano Lobu had approached, the sergeant stiffly saluting him.\n\n"So tell me sergeant, were fifth company's machineguns sabotaged?" The general asked.\n\n"Sir, yes, sir!" The sergeant replied. "Private Hasek was on maintenance duty, and he removed the firing pins from the weapons!" \n\n"Interesting... now tell me, were the troops informed this was a live fire exercise, that for all intents and purposes should be treated as war?"\n\n"Sir yes sir!"\n\n"I see..." the general pursed his lips and looked down to Hasek, who saluted him with one hoof before going back to his pushups."Come with me, private. I have some questions."\n\n"Sir yes sir I will be with you the moment the sergeant says I am done here!" Hasek replied enthusiastically, leaving General Lobo to raise an eyebrow and the sergeant to facehoof in silence behind him."

kasa.41.t:0 "Of Public Squares" ## Of Public Squares
kasa.41.d:0 "Since the early days, Kasa had long dedicated itself to democracy and robust open square debates. Even when it was a small village of runaway slaves, Seguro's main square acted as a public forum in election times, where citizens could freely interact with their would-be leaders.\n\nBut what allowed Kasan democracy to thrive in the early days aged poorly as the population grew and territory was gained. Whereas a Suguroan could simply walk to the city's main square to attend a public debate, those living on the Fireshore or elsewhere in the inner lands could hardly be expected to travel all the way to the capital for a political discussion. The fear of seeing Kasa's democracy a strictly Seguro-centric affair had been an increasingly pressing headache throughout Mansu Erba's term.\n\nThe candidates to succeed Mansu Erba met and agreed to find some way to resolve the issue. Their solution was twofold. First, they would travel together to all the greatest cities of Kasa to hold various debates in those cities as well. As to make sure that none of them could be held back on the tricky Kasan roads, they would travel together. Secondly, they would be followed by a press corps of journalists whose newspaper agreed to transcript the whole debate in their newspaper. It was an expensive solution but one that would have to do, even if it wouldn't do much good to illiterate and rural Kasan, of which there was plenty."
kasa.41.a:0 "That will have to do for now."

kasa.42.d:0 "A cold ocean breeze was blowing on the Ilha Rosca harbour as the candidates and the press corps made their way to the ship that had been selected to transport them between the coastal cities of Kása. A lot of them were in foul mood as it was early in the morning. Nothing strange there as there had to be little fanfare about the embarkment. After all, there was a security risk. The whole project felt strange to be honest. All hauled together like foals on a school trip. But at least, it would ensure that the debates could happen in a fair manner and be as inclusive as possible.\n\nAs the ship captain was going through some administrative papers, the four candidates waited quietly. Lûa Ramedi was sitting on his single suitcase, casually reading a book that he had covered with a blank paper. Those who were used to him knew he didn't enjoy the inevitable comments over what he read and all the chit chat that would follow. Pasarinha, for his part, had lit up his smoking pipe and was leisurely wandering around, inspecting the various ships in the port. He was the only one in attendance to feel somewhat guiddy. Yrmthu on the contrary seemed a little bit queasy and was nervously walking around the ship. At some point, she gently tapped it, almost as if she was checking if the heavy steel ship wasn't going to fall apart. However, if there was one who looked to be in a foul mood, it was Áltu Kexa. Bound to a wheelchair dutifully operated by a dull but bulky looking zebra, she was angrily bossing around the ship's crew who were embarking the usual cart she was using to walk around, asking them to be more careful with it.\n\nFinally, it was time to go."

kasa.67.d:0 "With the electoral campaign in full swing, few continued to worry about the participation in the most remote or illiterate communities. They had done their best with what meager means they had. However, one journalist decided to one day travel to some of those communities to see how they fared in this election. He was very surprised upon arriving at the scene that many citizens were not only aware of some of the issue discussed at the electoral debates but were voicing their own opinions on the most recent controversies just like their urban and literate compatriots. Perhaps even somewhat more so.\n\nIt was only when he settled at the local bar for his meal that he understood what had happened. During his meal, he noticed a zebra entering the bar with a copy of his own newspaper. Upon his entry, he saluted the patrons and sat down while the bar went quiet. He then proceeded to read the entire electoral debate and other news to the patrons who all listened attentively. Some creatures even entered the bar specifically to listen to the newspaper only to leave afterwards."

kasa.68.d:0 "It was always drafty in the mountain monasteries of Pónaidhean, but the views were well worth the cold. The locations were simply magnificent, each one crowning a mountain top, granting even the relatively simple structures the majesty of any palace. It was in one of these structures that Própri Kaneta was given the highest honour to teach. Apparently, the monk orders who acted both as teachers and defenders of the Pónaidhean tribes had deemed her worthy. Later, the zebra would find out that the First Commander of Pónaidhean herself, or the Taoiseach as it was called locally, had personally delivered work of Kása's most famous professors to the monks, for them to pick out a worthy candidate. There was never a word about why Própri Kaneta was deemed worthy.\n\nFirstly, the Kásan teacher called the entire endeavor madness. Why build a school so far away from... from everything! It took time for Kaneta to appreciate the Pónaidhean way of teaching, serene and calm, treating almost every lesson as if it were a holy rite. It took some getting used to, and the ponies certainly had to get used to her! Eventually, she could start answering questions about the world that the monks could not. Gaining the respect of the Pónaidhean monks was a slow process, but she was not the only zebra working on it. Modern scientific instruments and books from far away were regularly delivered, there were even computing machines!\n\nAll that was months ago, and this was the final day for Própri Kaneta in the monastery. But, as she descended down the steep steps and felt the wind howling through her mane, she looked back not only at her home away from home, but also at a dozen bright foals, who would follow their favourite teacher to Kása, determined to return home with the knowledge to make their land, their free land, a better place."

kasa.69.d:0 "During the decades of the Pentarchy's horrid reign over Barrad, the monks of Pónaidhean were among those who tried and help prevent the situation from spiraling out of control. In that, we owe them a debt of gratitude and so it was only natural that after relations were eased between Kása and them that they could play a role in the Horsford School of Spellcraft and Alchemy.\n\nWell today, the monks have finally agreed on a response. After many negotiations between our administration and their order, we were able to convince them of the need and importance of the school. A monk named Mairwen was selected to join the ranks of the Horsford teachers. The School director told us that she would be given the task to teach their students about proper methods in dealing with monsters and strange creatures."

Despite some initial acts of resistance and the distrust of many of the former nobility, reports show that the occupation is going exceptionally well. At first, our troops were coldly welcomed by many of the most remote rural populations where serfs and thralls had little understanding of what Kása stood for. Then, those who had collaborated with the Skapatoria came forward and the change of legislation caused its effects. Slowly, troops were no longer welcomed with fear or coldness but with flowers being thrown at them and cold mead being offered.\n\nFreed thralls enrolled in the military or happily offered help to our forces. Those who were employed in our companies even refused at first to take breaks, either from the force of habit or to show their happiness. That was quickly shut down by Kásan workers not wanting their own breaks and benefits being put in jeopardy. Commondeers and free deers were no different as the enforcement of new land rights, labour laws and the end of outrageous rent by the nobility allowed them to thrive. Some even began to hang the portrait of First Commander [ZES.GetLeader] in their homes.\n\nIt was really only in Hornavík that those who benefitted from the old system were resisting and even then, cooler heads seemed to be prevailing."

kasa.74.d:0 "By all accounts, Hornavík is a very beautiful city, even if a bit obsolete in many of its public works. However, there is more to it than fancy little streets and traditional deer architecture. It is a city founded through the wealth of the vikingar raid and the slave trade. Every fancy stone, every painted piece of wood, every golden leaf is only there thanks to the systemic oppression of thousands. Streets are named after famed murderers and statues have been erected to overseers of exploitation. This must change.\n\nNow of course, we stand not for bloodbath nor are we Griffonian emperors so burning down this city or looting it is out of the question. However, we can find better ways to showcase the tragic legacy of this city. Streets shall be renamed. Statues will be either replaced, removed or given plaques explaining the crimes committed by those they represent. A museum shall be open and dedicated to the history of thralldom and the viking atrocities. Finally, the city itself shall be renamed so that all may understand that the vikingar age is well and truly over."

Their stated goal is the protection of the language of Austurland and the protection of their national culture and traditions. From what we know, they are not an intrinsically violent group, nor do they seek to restore Austurland's independence through the force of arms.\n\nSo far, their biggest actions have been to paint the name Hornavík on as well as filing various complaints about the use of language and proper spelling on administrative documents. While some of their actions have some merits, a lot of them are inane or plain wrong even by their own cultural standards, which seems to indicate that the movement is mostly amateuristic."

Sadly, this has changed since the integration of Austurland.\n\nA prominent former vikingar moved in Seguro after the annexation and died last month. In his final requests, he asked to be buried in the vikingar fashioned, going away in a burning boat with all the military equipment of a traditional vikingar. While the late deer didn't go so far as to request the ritual sacrifices that were in fashion in ancient Austurland and had the money to pay for all expenses, the request still caused outrage among the Principes. They argued that considering many Kásans had fallen to vikingar raids, practicing such funeral rites would be a crime against their memory. The issue has been reported by the press and became quite a topic of controversy in both Seguro and Austurland."

However, not all did and some had an open mind about our rule and ideals. This was of course nothing new to Kása. Back in the days, when we were just a few villages in the Ilhas Lagostas, our ancestors had to come up with innovative ways to convince the many pirates of the time to lay down their weapons and embrace civilian life. We had success then and we will again.\n\nAdmiral Chane Haoniyao, a former zebrican pirate himself, was heavily involved in reaching out to his former "colleagues" in Austurland and worked to convince them of the benefits of reforming."

According to him, many of them have been willing to go back to civilian life and turn on their old lives. However, there was more to the meetings than just this. Some of the vikingar had kept in touch with the defecting vikingar who had sailed away and after some careful contacts, a bargain was offered.\n\nIf an amnesty is passed, some of the defecting vikingars would surrender themselves and give their ships to Kásan command. In exchange, they would not be prosecuted and would continue to serve in the navy. In addition, they would be able to serve under the name of "new vikingars" and dedicate themselves to active anti-piracy actions. Chane Haoniyao explains their motive as a desire of maintaining their families' legacy in some form. However, some in the administration fear that such a move would cause outrage among the victims of their old piracy raids."

Proper checks were made to prevent any of the old war criminals of Austurland from joining on the sly but no such cases were noticed. With no great recruitment campaign being underway, it left some puzzled.\n\nThen, an article came out in the press interviewing some recruits and a retired naval officer who had been a freed thrall, one of Mansu Erba's. In the article, he spoke extensively about how he had met Pasarinha during his early time as a sailor. For a long time, he had forgotten about it but during the electoral campaign, he had the chance to read about Pasarinha's vision of the navy as a place where one can reinvent themselves. And so, when Austurland was integrated into Kása, he was inspired to go back to his native land. There, he met with families of vikingars with the help of Admiral Chane Haoniyao. He understood that the great social changes there would leave them with a lack of purpose and a hard time finding their place in the world, now that they were. And so, he would tell them the story of Pasarinha as well as his own. Though, rather humbly, he would put more emphasis on the First Commander's life story. Many of those young deers were then inspired to join the army and some of them shared their story to the journalist."

kasa.80.t:0 "The Legend of Tęczowit" ## event after election about Gryphus myth
kasa.80.d:0 "This week, a new novel hits the shelves in Kása's bookshops. Alicja Szamińska, an exiled Gryphussian poetess living in Fyrport, tells the tale of Tęczowit, a griffon cossack living during the era of the founding of the free cities.\n\nThe opening of the book reads like a series of short stories about Tęczowit's daring adventures, the meetings of a whole gallery of plucky characters and ties into some Gryphussian folktales. The stories do build up to something greater as the threat of an alliance between a Gryphian warlord and the prince of Sydia looms. The final short story climax as during a flying race, Tęczowit badly loses but finally finds the strength to make one last push. Speeding up exponentially, he final hits a critical speed, causing an explosion of light and projecting a rainbow ring over Tiefbrunnen. The rainbow wave, was able to be seen from all corners of Gryphus.\n\nSzamińska continues the story as a more serious political tale but still full of humor as Tęczowit finds himself the unlikely leader of the free cities in their struggle against the prince of Sydia and his Gryphian goons. Eventually, he overcomes them, defeat them at a decisive battle in Camafeu. The warlord is vanquished but the prince of Sydia flees. Tęczowit chases him right to Salt Island where he finally catches the evil prince to promptly give his bottom a good literal kicking!\n\nThe novel ends on a sad but hopeful note. It explained that the old Tęczowit died happily with his friends and that as soon as he died, the spirit of alliance among the Free Cities quickly died. Yet, his spirit lived on as his friends promised one another that he would remain in their heart, just as the spirit of friendship would endure in the heart of the Gryphussians. Only once that spirit triumphed, would Gryphus be truly free and peaceful again.\n\nThe book is already a smash hit despite some criticism over its historicity and plot points being borrowed from well-known tale, such as his flying maneuver. Yet, the Gryphussian exiles absolutely adore it considering how rarely native figures are mentioned in any media, let alone focusing on them."
kasa.80.a:0 "An entertaining read!"

kasa.81.t:0 "The Legend of Tęczowit" ## the Gryphus event for Gryphus itself too
kasa.81.d:0 "Last month, a novel was published in Kása, penned by the exiled griffoness Alicja Szamińska. It tells the tale of a semi-legendary figure named Tęczowit who was a cossack in pre-Groverian Gryphus.\n\nThe novel is written in largely humoristic style until Tęczowit somehow unites Gryphus after performing what some have pointed to look like the famed Equestrian "sonic rainboom". The next part of the book tales the tale of a war between the cities of Gryphus under Tęczowit and the prince of Sydia, allied to a Gryphian warlord. Eventually, the Gryphussian hero defeats and humiliates them. The novel ends on a hopeful note about the Tęczowit's spirit of friendship enduring and being foretold as the herald of freedom and peace in Gryphus.\n\nThe book angered quite a few citizens among the sympathizers of Brodfeld, the Gryps-Süd GmbH and the Order of Opinicus with calls to ban it or burn any found copies. However, many literate natives have already put their claws on it and it circulates widely with many identifying with the protagonist, despite the ludicrous storytelling. Overall, it seems that the exile has achieved exactly what she had hoped for: rousing the natives. But it takes more than a nice story from an exile to make things happen."

kasa.82.t:0 "The Degriffonianization Issue" ## after Gryphus conquest is triggered
kasa.82.d:0 "After the liberation of Gryphus, many Gryphussian exiles came forward to propose an ambitious plan. They argued that Gryphus had fallen prey to intense colonization after the Groverian conquests. Because of this, many places were renamed to Herzlandian or Sicameonese with little care to the history and dignity of Gryphus. So, they argue that the liberation of Gryphus won't ever be complete without a significant revision of the names. They also request funds for the creation of memorials, museums and various charities dedicated to help the impoverished Gryphussian reclaim their cultural heritage and lost prosperity.\n\nHowever, despite the claims of some of the most enthusiastic exiles, not all of Gryphus is culturally homogenous and many parts of the region are not even majority-Gryphussian. Academics and some members of the administration argued that the extensive plan shouldn't be implemented but rather watered-down to take into account the various cultural sensitivities of the population, much like it was done with the Wittenlandic places integrated into Kása."

kasa.83.d:0 "A new company was recently registered in Riaportu under the name of Gara Sórti Incorporated. Despite appearing out of thin air, it immediately acquired a great deal of smaller businesses and announced many projects. After some investigations, it appeared that it is primarily backed by wealthy Sicameonese-Gryphussian families. While their names don't appear on the records of those who directly participated in the management of the Gryphusische Südkontinent-Gesellschaft, there are strong suspicions that these families directly or indirectly benefited from their business. Our financial advisors also claim that many deals made by the new company point to a resurgence of the old Gryps-Süd GmbH network of relations and might be a front for some families currently under greater scrutiny.\n\nOverall, some think that the Gara Sórti pose an internal threat to the economic stability and fairness of Kása while also depriving native Gryphussian of economic prosperity. Overall, it would mean that the war of liberation may have been for naught as the old elite just remain in power by whitewashing themselves as Kásan. On the other hoof, some within the administration argue that the Kásan civil code would prevent Gara Sórti from ever gaining the kind of power the old Gryps-Süd GmbH had within the Free Towns. In addition, they would have to compete with Kásan and Macawian companies without any of the old advantages they had. Finally, unless these families were found guilty of crimes, we can't stop them from peacefully living their lives."

kasa.84.d:0 "This week a vast coordinated protest was organized by the Solidarity Movement and its leader Edward Piorowski against the Gara Sórti corporation. Edward Piorowski is a long-time fixture of the Gryphussian socialist opposition to the old regime. He was particularly involved in labour disputes against the unethical and brutal methods of the Gryphusische Südkontinent-Gesellschaft. It is therefore no wonder that when families with ties to the old corporation resurfaced to form the Gara Sórti corporation, he rallied his old comrades to denounce their attempt at maintaining their hold on the Gryphussian economy.\n\nWhile some feared that he may be attempting to take radical and violent action against his old foe, the protest was largely peaceful and seemed to be more about warning the corporation than staging any revolutionary action. Piorowski also took the occasion to call on the Kásan administration to strengthen the labour laws in Kása. He concluded his speech to the labour unions that should any unethical treatment of workers be resumed, strikes should be their immediate response."

Calling themselves the Society of the Groverian Oath, they seem to claim heritage of the Order of Opinicus and are determined to restore Griffonian-aligned rule over Gryphus. Little is known at this point about their exact resources.\n\nSeveral acts of vandalism and intimidation have been so far attributed to this group. But most heinous has been the murder of the Gryphussian poetess Alicja Szamińska who had returned from exile in Fyrport and was found shot in her new home in Riaportu. It wasn't hard as the murder was signed with the old Opinicus insignia being carved on her door. Some of their manifestos and propaganda posters call for a vast uprising against the "godless Kásan occupation"."

He had joined it out of loneliness and belief that it would stand for some traditional values he believed in. However, the murder of the poetess Alicja Szamińska was a step too far for him and he explained that he did not stand for terrorism. He then explained all that he knew about the Society.\n\nFrom his testimony, we now know that the organization is much smaller than suspected and mainly composed of disgruntled former knights and sympathizers. Their leaders turned out to be Albus Piscis, an old general of the Order of Opinicus but not among the inner circle of the order. The knight offered us names and locations of meetings. With this information, a vast police operation should allow us to nip this insurgency in the bud."
kasa.86.a:0 "They will be dealt with!"

kasa.87.t:0 "Operation Sinóra" ## after previous event
kasa.87.d:0 "Today, a massive police operation was launched throughout the Gryphussian territories. Hundreds of griffons were arrested for their participations in the Society of the Groverian Oath. A few managed to escape but all accused of having participated in the death of Alicja Szamińska have been captured. All the arrested will be trialed. Those who have proven themselves to be guilty of violent acts of terrorism will be sentenced to death or heavy prison sentences. We can hope that this will deter other nostalgics from joining such organizations in the near future.\n\nAlbus Piscis has been captured trying to cross the Evi river in Camafeu after having been tipped off by a friendly police officer. The old knight had already been sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against life and will soon be executed in Riaportu.\n\nOverall, this is the end of the Society of the Groverian Oath as we know it. Many will now sleep better."

kasa.88.d:0 "The organized nature of the Triarchic griffon faith has long been a point of contention, not only in Kása but in other parts of Griffonia neighbouring the old holdings of the Grover dynasty. While many of the Gryphussian, Prywhenian and other griffon minorities in Kása were happy to simply go about their lives, the situation in Gryphus was different.\n\nThe Order of Opinicus was a divisive partner for many of the griffon clergy, many of which believed in a more harmonic treatment of the Gryphussian minority. As for the Sicameonese minorities in coastal Gryphus, they had little love for the knight's increasing radicalism in recent decades. In the end, most of the clergy which did endorse the knights were the knighted clergy. And so, when the knights fled and its remnants dismantled, the griffon clergy in Gryphus had little reason to maintain the bare ties with the Triarchy in Griffenheim. And so, after a multitude of meetings with the Gryphussian national movement and Kásan griffons, the clergy has decided to reorganize itself into a reformed Temple of Gryphus, free of Griffonian influence and dedicated to purely spiritual matters.\n\nNow, however, they are requesting financial help to ensure that the transition goes smoothly and that the new Temple can establish itself. Some however fear that this may be the path to an organized state religion which would be hugely problematic to the Kásan conception of its role in religious affairs."

kasa.89.d:0 "The Reformed Temple has had a few difficulties in convincing the pious griffons of the Gryphus territories as well as congregations. However, its clergy did not give up and instead organized a conference with various group to find funding and common ground. Among the two groups that the Temple approached were the sicameonese-speaking minorities and the native Gryphussian exiles. In a surprising moment of compromise, they were able to win them over and not see the historically opposing group bicker and sabotage an agreement.\n\nWhile there were several finer details to the agreement, the most emblematic was the revision of the religious canon followed by the reformed Temple. Under the influence of the knights of Opinicus, the Gryphussian clergy had long enforced a strict adherence to a triarchic faith based on the sole worship of Boreas, Arcturius and Eyr. The limited canon was already unpopular but was officially discarded under the agreement. The Temple would officially recognise and condone the worship of Sycaecia, the ancient patron goddess of Sicaemon, Eviliana, goddess of the Evi River, and an entirely new divinity: Tęczowit. This last integration is perhaps the most surprising as Tęczowit was so far just a highly popular mythical figure of Gryphus. However, he has now been recognized as the God of freedom, cossacks and protector of Gryphus. There are still disagreements over the exact new canon but overall, it seems that the new changes are not causing any waves or strong reactions in the populace.\n\nNew officially recognized temples dedicated to the three gods are set to be built in Camafeu, Gryfów and Riaportu under the patronage of the returning Gryphussian exiles and families of Sicameonese descent."
kasa.89.a:0 "A surprising development."

kasa.91.t:0 "Dynamic Kása"
kasa.91.d:0 "Today, a zebra named Áqueda Cahillia demonstrated her new invention at the Seguro Music Academy: the dynamophone. The strange device resembling a piano surrounded by various electrical devices produced clear and pure tones resembling those of a piano but transcended.\n\nAfter the performance, Cahillia explained how her invention worked. Rather than producing sounds through the traditional methods of hitting wires as she described it, the dynamophone produced electrical signals. Those electrical signals were outputted by connecting ordinary telephone receivers to radio loudspeakers. The name of the instrument came from the large electric dynamos needed to produce the audio signals.\n\nA Macawian investor already showed interest in the project and a dynamophone concert has already been announced at the Seguro Opera House."
kasa.91.a:0 "Electric music? This must be a passing trend."

kasa.92.t:0 "The Raid"
kasa.92.d:0 "It was a foggy morning over the great strait. Captain Mascarenhas didn't like that but the client had been adamant. The shipment had to reach São Penário before the end of the week so there was no waiting for Admiral Haoniyao's convoy. So far, it had all gone well. No rain either. Then, he noticed something coming out of the fog. He took out his telescope and looked out. Could it already be the Macawian fleet? He froze.\n\nThe deer flag of Austurland.\n\nThe captain grabbed the intercom and yelled out: "Action stations! The Vikingars are here!" he dropped the intercom and grabbed on to his steering wheel. Spirits... Why couldn't they have waited for the convoy!\n\nAs the fog cleared, it became clear that the Austurlandic ship was alone. That was good, thought the captain but they were too. He took his telescope and watched the ship. Two guns. Bigger than theirs too. They would have to try and flee.\n\nOn the deck, the crew was busy trying to get the gun up but even so, the deer ship was placing itself behind them. They had no line of fire. But they did. The first shell hit quickly but they were gaining speed. Second shell hit the water, flooding the crew but leaving them unharmed. There was a chance! If the deers didn't learn how to fire, that is. But then, the fire alarm blared and the ship began to slow down. The first shell had damaged the engines. It was over. It didn't even take five minutes...\n\nThe vikingars approached and boarded the ship. Some crew members tried to resist but they were soon overwhelmed. After the last shot was fired, The deers gathered them on the main deck and began to empty the ship's cargo. They didn't pay much attention to them. Then, their captain arrived. Mascarenhas tried and appeal to him.\n\n"Please. Just take the cargo and let us go. With the engine busted, it'll take days to reach São Penário. You'll be long gone before we can do anything."\n\nThe vikingar approached him and kneeled towards him. He grinned.\n\n"Why just the cargo, lad?""
kasa.92.a:0 "Olaf! Bring out the chains!"

kasa.93.t:0 "The Loot"
kasa.93.d:0 "This morning, the vikingar ship Ukko's Rock came back in Hornavík's harbour from a successful raid. Captain Grettirsson paraded about the dock, showing off his loot. A whole shipment of luxury goods and two dozens of Kásan thralls of zebra and harpy origin. Asked about his targets, he did complain that he would have gotten a whole ship to boot if it hadn't started burning in the attack. The Kásans don't make sturdy ships. Still, every loot gained without a single lost vikingar was a celebration!"

While we were obviously not invited to this meeting, our Skapatario agents aided by local sympathizers among the Wittenlandic inhabitants of the city watched closely.\n\nFrom what we've gathered, two nations in the coalition seemed to be looking southwards. First was Ponaidhean who advocated for condemnation and actions against Barrad and Austurland though it was voted down in favor of condemnation of the atrocities committed in the west. However, they also tried - in vain - to put a rapprochement with us on the table. It is no surprise as the Free Ponies have little sway over the coalition's affairs. On the other hoof, the Nimbusian delegate, Pegicles, denounced the Skapatoria Program and defended their form of slavery as not qualifying as such.\n\nOf note were the fact that Bakara argued for a more moral coalition, Wittenland made little wave and focused on Gryphian cossack raids, Diamond Mountain's heiress to the throne Princess Molly made a splash for her charisma while her father endorsed continued use of slavery and finally, Lake City took a surprising stand in favor of democracy."

The powers of the River Republic and Wittenland made little wave while Diamond Mountain endorsed the continued use of slavery in their territory. The only silver lining beyond the Ponaidhean motion was Lake City's surprising endorsement of democracy and the introduction of the heiress to the throne of Diamond Mountain, Princess Molly who showed a less extreme face than her father."

jan_brazowy.1.d:0 "Today, a patrol led by knight Edelgard failed to report back to Grypsburg. While there were often delays, Edelgard was known to be a diligent griffoness. So at the end of the day, the komtur decided to prepare a small force to investigate the fate of the patrol. However, before they could depart, a few villagers arrived at the castle with a cart. They said they found it near the edge of the village.\n\nThe cart was heavily stained by blood. Inside it were helmets and broken Opinicus weapons and shields. However the worst was a spear on which the head of knight Edlegard had been planted with a note. The note said in native Gryphussian:\n\n"To whom it may concern,\n\nThese things were found on the bodies of trespassers on land that did not belong to them. As a courtesy, we send them back. Do forgive us for the lack of attention put in the transport. We would have made a more proper package but we didn't care much about it.\n\nSurrender your castle to your serfs, distribute your wealth, shatter your swords, shower yourself with dirt in sign of shame, leave Gryphus and never return. Or we'll make you.\n\nKind regards,\nJan Brązowy"\n\nThe Komtur yelled in anger. That Jan. Him again. That damned bandit had been fighting his little war in impunity for too many years. But there was no point in searching for him. Him and his band were already off to Gryphia, Kàsa or Barrad. They never stayed in place."

Allegedly.\n\nBrązowy is a well-known figure in Kàsa, a revolutionary figure in his native Gryphus and one of the staunchest abolitionists in the world. Though, he is also known for being slightly... overzealous about his cause. For years, he fought a guerilla war in his native country alongside a small band of followers, fighting for liberty and the right of self-determination of the native Gryphussians. His biggest enemy being the Order of Opinicus, he always found no shortage of friends and allies in our country. However, the government never acknowledged his presence as it could mean war otherwise. Despite this, it was a barely kept secret that the madgriff collaborates frequently with agents of the Skapatoria Program."

### Austurland negotiation events

austurlandkasa.1.t:0 "The Unlikely Chance" ##Peaceful proposition to Austurland
austurlandkasa.1.d:0 "There's little love lost between Kása and Austurland. Ever since the founding of Kása, the deer harrassed us and even slew Sinora Pon. Yet, the winds of change have swept our eastern neighbor, and the new Jarl has surpassed all our expectations. She has abolished thralldom, broken the power of the nobility and stated her intent to create a new Austurland, an Austurland that we have much in common with.\n\nMaybe this heralds a change for Austurland and Kása's relations? After decades of bloodshed, maybe the time has come for peace to reign between or two nations? Not just a lack of aggression either, but a formal and full declaration of peace and cooperation?\n\nIt is a brave notion, not the least considering our longstanding enmity, but the past is the past, and the future is the future. Jarl Ygritte is a First Commander in her own right, and she has much in common with our founders. Maybe the time has indeed come to reach out a hoof, and find common ground despite all that has been."
austurlandkasa.1.a:0 "We were enemies, but we could be kin."

austurlandkasa.2.t:0 "A Curious Offer" ##Event for Austurland about the treaty proposition
austurlandkasa.2.d:0 ""To the Most Noble [OLV.GetLeader] of Austurland.\n\nThe traditional enmity between our peoples is an inescapable fact, one that it would be foalish to attempt to downplay. Yet all the same, this does not mean that we are permitted to be blind to the changes that can strike a nation. Time, after all, can make hatred turn into forgiveness, bitterness into hope, and enemies into friends.\n\nOur founder, Akeeku, was a slave who seized the moment when he saw it, and rose up against his oppressors, overthrowing them and leading his people to freedom. We venerate him even today, and yet we would do his memory a disservice if we did not see those who exhibited the same virtues and the same victories as him. It might pain some of the more resentful citizens of our nation, but recent events has proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that our eastern neighbor has had the fortune to receive a leader of similar virtue and capacity.\n\nYou have turned your nation towards the light of freedom, breaking the chains of your people and embracing principles that align closely with our own. Adding to that, you have shown that you bow to neither noble nor tyrant, and this has raised a question for all of Kása: when the ruler of our eastern neighbor stand as tall and with moral fibre equal to any of our First Commanders, maybe it would behoove us to finally lay down arms, and let peace reign? When Austurland's new Jarl has guided them towards principles like our own, would not both our homelands benefit from looking across the border and see friends instead of enemies? Neither seeks the other's subjugation, and both are interested in protecting their people from tyranny.\n\nThis offer has never before been extended to Austurland, yet the character we have seen you show make us feel confident it will be weighed fairly.\n\nI hope to hear from you regarding this proposal, and that we will be able to at last find peace between our two nations.\n\nSincerely yours, [ZES.GetLeader]""
austurlandkasa.2.a:0 "The wars and raids are over, the Zebras are our friends."

austurlandkasa.3.t:0 "The Outstretched Hoof" ##Austurland has agreed to peace
austurlandkasa.3.d:0 "We have received a reply from the Jarl, and it is the best possible that we could have hoped for! She has - tentatively - agreed to our proposal, and the path to not only peace, but cooperation, lies open in front of us! A flurry of activity has begun throughout Kása, and [ZES.GetLeader] is leading a meeting at the border to finalize the treaty. With it, Kása and Austurland will be two nations as one, standing firm for harmony and freedom."
austurlandkasa.3.a:0 "Great news!"

austurlandkasa.4.t:0 "The Rejection"  ##Austurland has refused
austurlandkasa.4.d:0 "The Jarl rejected our outstretched hoof, and she did so vehemently. Her interest is Austurland, and Austurland only. This has not and will not ever change, not as long as she rules, she stated.\n\nSo it is then. If Austurland so blindly will refuse peace we will never be safe. We will never see the legacy of those who murdered Sinora Pon and who raided and enslaved us for over a century ended. How much more blood, then, shall be spilt? We do not know, but we do know that we will not silently wait for them to come at us. Austurland will be neutralized, whether by friendship or firepower.\n\nAs we did against the Slavers, the Pirates and the Knights, we now march to war against the deer."
austurlandkasa.4.a:0 "Damn you, Jarl."

austurlandkasa.5.t:0 "The Bloody East" ##No negotiation with oppressors
austurlandkasa.5.d:0 "Austurland has tormented us like few others, with their raiders harrying our shores and enslaving our people at many times. Though recent times saw peace, and we perhaps had reason to hope the new Jarl would change things, those hopes have been long since dashed. Jarl Ygritte turned out to be no better than any of her predecessors, and the only real thing her rise to power gave us was time, time to prepare ourselves.\n\nThe Deer are too much of a threat to be left alone. They already slew Sinora Pon and caused us untold grief once;  what happens when they come once more? We don't know, and we don't plan to find out, for there will not be a second time. Kása will go to war, a war so that the raiders will be broken, their thralls freed and the tyranny of these blood-soaked berserkers ended for good!"

austurlandkasa.6.t:0 "Naughty, Naughty" ##Cheater event

Thought we wouldn't notice, did you?\n\nNaturally, you play the game as you please, even if you want to be a little cheater who starts skipping around our carefully balanced timescale. But the thing is? That means we get to do as we please too. Please, do enjoy this debuff and have fun."

austurlandkasa.7.t:0 "Austurland has Fallen" ##Conquered Austurland
austurlandkasa.7.d:0 "The last stronghold of the deer has fallen, and Austurland is finally under our control. It is a difficult thing to fathom, yet we did it: we went on the offensive, and the tyrants and slavers that used to torment us have fallen before us. Yet, we stand as conquerors in a land not our own, and we look back to see the fire and death our invasion created. The price paid was not just our own, and many of those who now are citizens of Kása have much reason to despise us. All the same, the thralls whose chains are now broken have rallied to us, more than eager to escape bondage, and the old elites will no longer be able to use them. Kása always has done, she will rebuild, she will elevate the broken, and she will prosper once again."
austurlandkasa.7.a:0 "It was harsh, but it is done."

austurlandkasa.8.t:0 "The Kása-Austurlandic Treaty" ##Treaty from Austurland POV
austurlandkasa.8.d:0 "On the border of our two nations, [ZES.GetLeader] and [OLV.GetLeader] have formally signed a treaty of peace and cooperation between their two nations. The meeting was tense, but hopeful, and both sides brought their most sincere well-wishes as well as gifts for the other side. A century of blood and death has finally been laid to rest, and a century of peace and co-prosperity is dawning."
austurlandkasa.8.a:0 "To friendship and harmony!"

austurlandkasa.9.t:0 "The Stymied Raiders" ##If Austurland does not exist, is subject of Kása or is in same faction
austurlandkasa.9.d:0 "Austurland was a great threat to Kása for the longest time, and after [ZES.GetLeader] took over after Mansu Erba, it seemed inevitable that the Austurland question would come to a head. Whether by warfare or diplomacy, something needed to be done. As it turned out though, fate played its cards early, and the Austurland question has to be put to rest. No longer are the deer in the east threatening our epople, and Kása is left to breathe a sigh of relief."
austurlandkasa.9.a:0 "Fate twists and turns..."

### Austurland-Kása unification events

austurlandkasa.10.t:0 "The Unfication Proposal" ##Unification proposal from both POVs
austurlandkasa.10.d:0 "An audacious proposal has come up recently, one never before imagined. With the recent rapproachment between Austurland and the Kása Free State, our nations have found themselves bound closer together than either side had expected. Friendships have been formed, old wounds have begun to heal, and many have realized that there is a possibility not just for continued coexistence, but for unification.\n\nIt's a mad concept, but there is a legitimate backing for the creation of a two-nation federation, under which diplomatic and military questions would be handled by Kása and Austurland together. Their proximity and their size means that whatever threatens one of them can threaten both of them, and if there is a practical reason as well as popular support for the nation, maybe the time has come to take the step?"

austurlandkasa.12.t:0 "Kasa declines for now" ##U

### Military Events ###

kasam.1.t:0 "Wargames" ##Maneuvers event/Prátikas
kasam.1.d:0 "The results of the first Prátikas wargames have arrived and are mixed. The army was given a scenario of a surprise western invasion composed of vikingar troops lead by a rogue general nicknamed Ettirgy as well as intel of a possible Barradian incursion.\n\nDespite Field Marshall Lobu's best efforts, our militia performed less than stellarly, taking too long to properly mobilize to respond to the incursion. General Vispo and her legionaries saved the day by breaking the enemy offensive before they could overwhelm the still mobilising militia units. Colonel Wojtek also reorganized the Barradian border guard in a timely manner. Despite them, Fyrport has suffered enormous damages.\n\nOf course, this wall an exercise but should it ever occur in real life, it would mean thousands of Kásan deaths as well as possible intervention by foreign powers. Overall, we have still much to learn to be ready for external threats but our military staff is reportedly eager to improve and have taken a liking to the wargame."
kasam.1.a:0 "Growing pain. We'll get there."

kasam.2.t:0 "Blood Sisters" ##Macavian military coop
kasam.2.d:0 "For as long as Ilha Rosca stood in the days of Akeeku, the Kásans could always rely on their benefactor overseas. Some nations would have seen the young zebra nation as a puppet but to Macawia, Kása was more than that. It was her sister republic. And so that partnership grew.\n\nThere may have been disagreements on trade, on policy and on many others things. But when it came to defense and the protection of freedom, Macawians and Kásans were and would always be sister republics, ready to aid one another in their time of need.\n\nNow, as Kása readied herself to face the chaos and violence of modern Griffonia, it needed help. And Macawia was happy to oblige. The loose partnership would be expanded with exchanges of idea, doctrine, attaches and even common training."
kasam.2.a:0 "The two republics, together forever!"

kasam.3.t:0 "The Guest From Overseas" ##Invite offivers
kasam.3.d:0 "Come on, lad! That suitcase is light as a feather! There must be only six bottles in there!"\n\nAlfred let out a painful sigh as he struggled to follow general Pedro Vaz de Cabral who simply pranced away without a care in the world. The whole trip from São Penário had been like this and he just wanted it to end. Fortunately, they were now at the Military Academy and he would soon be freed for the day. He couldn't wait.\n\nAs they approached the Academy, Vaz de Cabral stopped, causing Alfred to bump into him. The harpy didn't mind, apparently fascinated by something he was seeing. Alfred dropped the suitcase and looked on. Just exiting the Academy was colonel Wojtek, probably leaving a staff meeting. Vaz de Cabral walked up to him.\n\n"Hey! You! Tell me! How hard can you maul a damn slaver, lad?"\n\nWojtek growled at him, likely enraged at the lack of military etiquette. General Vaz de Cabral didn't mind, simply wiping off the drop of spit the bear had put on his sunglasses.\n\n"I like this one! Take this lad, you smoke it after the rum tonight!"\n\nAlfred felt forced to intervene as the general put a cigar in the pocket of colonel Wojtek.\n\n"Colonel Wojtek is a highly respected member of our military. Sir! This harpy here is General Pedro Vaz de Cabral, the exchanged officer sent straight from São Penário."\n\nAfter Alfred laughed nervously, Wojtek left them, throwing away the cigar into the nearby bushes. Alfred hadn't even finished saluting the artillery officer that Vaz de Cabral was already off, towards the academy.\n\n"Where is the mess hall here? I'm starving!""
kasam.3.a:0 "My general! Please wait up!"

kasam.4.t:0 "The Guests From the North" ##Send soldiers abroad
kasam.4.d:0 "As Alfred and Katia made their way towards the military academy of São Penário, Katia couldn't help but marvel at the beauties of the cities. At every turned, she implored their driver to slow down so she could look up the buildings. It really was quite a place. Yet, they were not there for tourism but for military cooperation.\n\nTheir arrival at the Macawian Military Academy went splendidly. The harpies had all been quite friendly and their accomodation was much more comfortable than they would have expected. And so, they went to sleep eager to start their formation.\n\nThe next morning at five o'clock, they were suddenly woken up by a soldier playing the trumpet.\n\n"Get up, maggots!"\n\nKatia and Alfred, startled, jumped out of their beds to be faced with a large harpy, grinning from both sides of his beak and smoking a large cigar, flanked by the damn trumpetist. They tried to point out that they were officers, not common recruits but it was to no avail.\n\n"Nonsense! I don't know what kind of sheep's military training they give you up north but here, every officer should get up as early as possible and go for a run."\n\nAs they returned from their track rounds, an officer came running, asking them what on earth they were doing. After explaining themselves, the officer laughed.\n\n"Oh that was general Pedro Vaz de Cabral. He has his own sense of humor. You shouldn't pay attention to what he says outside of a classroom but you should run to your classes. He made you late I believe.""
kasam.4.a:0 "Run, Alfred, run!"

kasam.5.t:0 "No Strangers Anymore" ##Legion/Ramui Di Stranjerus
kasam.5.d:0 "Kása's Foreign Legion, officially known as the Ramui Di Stranherus had its origins when the young state was in a precarious position. Macawia, eager to protect her young sister republic, funded the training and foundation of a regiment made from veterans and mercenaries from across Griffonia.\n\nFor a long time, the legion remained a diverse corps but overtime, griffons exiled from the neighbouring Gryphus came and fought for Kása. To many of them, it was a way to fight for their desire for freedom without having to endure the orders of either the knights of Opinicus or the dreadful pay of the Gryps-Süd GmbH. It wasn't a free Gryphus but it felt like the closest they had. And soon, they became the core of the Kásan bulwark.\n\nNow it was time to change the Legion. No longer a leased regiment from Macawia but a jointly owned force, shared between Kása and Macawia."
kasam.5.a:0 "Together! For Freedom!"

kasam.6.t:0 "The New Legionaries"
kasam.6.d:0 "As she looked over the training camp of the Legion, Áltu couldn't help but feel pride. For all her reservations about these forces, she had to admit that there was something thrilling about seeing a whole army of volunteers dedicated to the cause of freedom. Amaltia Vispo next to her seemed to share her enthusiasm.\n\n"All these griffs, most of them out of Gryphus and Brodfeld will obey your orders, ready to die to defend democracy and harmony."\n\nThis made Áltu think about what Pasarinha had told her many nights ago. She turned towards the griffoness.\n\n"Who do they serve, general? Kása? Or Macawia?"\n\nThe griffoness seemed a bit shocked by the idea and frowned before answering.\n\n"My First Commander... They are not mercenaries. They are exiles, lost in a world that robbed them of a happy life in their homelands. They fight for the flag and what it represents. Not for who stocks the mess hall."\n\n"Good."\n\nThen it was time for the review of the troop. They formed a perfect line, a show that Áltu did enjoy. Finally, she stood and spoke.\n\n"Legionaries!\nNone of you were born under the sun-spangled flag. Who you were before and what you did then matters little. You have abandoned your old lives and decided to put them in service of Kása. What we do by duty of birth, you do out of your own free will.\nFor freedom!"\n\n"For freedom!" cried out the legionaries, throwing their hats in the wind. Áltu smiled.\n\n"Who's playing the fiddle now?""

kasam.7.d:0 "As Áltu took her place to the stage for her military address, she couldn't help but feel underwhelmed. Field Marshall Lobu had done his best to prepare a display of Kásan military force but it was all so... shoddy. The militia volunteers looked all eager as they waited for her to speak but their equipment was antiquated to say the least. Apart from the legionaries of the Ramui di Stranjerus, standing proudly behind Amaltia Vispo, few looked like actual military members. Where was the heavy equipment that she had seen during the Asterionese military parades during her trips? Where was the glory? Was it all that Kása had to offer in the quest for liberty? She sighed. There was work to do.\n\n"My fellow Kásans,\n\nThere are clouds in the horizons, the dark and looming clouds of tyranny and slavery. Clouds our ancestors escaped to build something great. But as we prospered, we got used to the clouds on the horizon. We got used to being surrounded by all matters of misery. We got content with the timid rays of sunshine peeking through them, shining upon us.\n\nKásans, all of you stand ready. I can see it in your eyes. The courage to fix bayonet and charge all those who would threaten us, to near death and face it without flinching. And for this courage, I command you. But this won't be enough. In the coming years, I will ask more of you. To be ready is not enough. To have one's heart in the good place is not enough. The bayonet is not enough. To finally lift those clouds and allow the whole world to see the sun at last, we will have to sacrifice much so we can be ready to rise to the challenge. There is but one question. Are you all willing? Are you up to the task of fighting for liberty in Barrad, in Austurland, in Gryphus, at home or elsewhere? What say you?"\n\nSilence fell on the field until a soldier rose his rifle and cried out: "Liberty!" Then another, and another until all in the field chanted the Kásan warcry."

kasam.8.t:0 "The Midnight Meeting"
kasam.8.d:0 "The storm rain was battering the window of Áltu's office. Áltu looked in the distance as a tree fell in the neighbouring park. She blew on her tea and drank a sip. The nightly storm was befitting her mood. So little was going her way. Earlier in the afternoon, they tried it again. Silera Medu and the Harpy Lobby as she began to call it had been out in full force, trying to convince her to increase cooperation with the Macawians. She had stormed out. Why was the Kásan establishment so Tartarus-bent on increasing reliance on Macawia rather than developing a true army of freedom. She understood the use of it but why expand it to such extents? The more power they have the harpies, the less Kása would be able to choose their own way to wage war. She even pondered. Was it to control her? Would Ramedi have to deal with such pressure? Thunder roared again in the distance as she took another sip.\n\nThen came the knock. For a moment, she hoped it was her husband but she knew he was away for a symposium in Fyrport. She sighed: "Come in, Silera."\n\nThe diplomat entered, followed by none other than Pasarinha. Áltu sneered: "What is he doing here? I don't recall hiring him."\n\nSilera interjected: "I took the liberty of inviting him. Sir Pasarinha is a well-known expert on Macawian relations after all. He has only been communicated what is public record of course."\n\n"Well, you get out then. I can listen to the expert without the help of your ears, Silera."\n\nSilera looked surprised but didn't object. He nodded respectfully, smiled or rather smirked and left. Was it what he had hoped for? Or was it just his usual shifty self? She didn't knew but at the very least, she would rather listen to the old accountant rather than him. She sat back, sipped her tea, and waved at him to start talking.\n\n"My First Commander. Miss Kexa. I'm afraid that you are getting played like a fiddle. No, no. Do not throw me out yet. What I mean is that Silera knows how to get under your skin which is why he invited me. But I'll tell you this. I know him. He's offering you a deliberately limited treaty, hoping you refuse it. Then, he'll use that to rally the Advisory Council into forcing you to sign a much more binding treaty. So play the part, sign and maneuver from there."\n\n"How do you know that and why are you telling me?"\n\n"He cheats at cards and thinks I don't notice. You don't play and I'd rather trust earnestness in military affairs.""

zes_candidates_info_screen_lua_text:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th March 972 in Seguro\n\n§YBiography§!:Lûa Ramedi's political career has been defined by his service and loyalty to Mansu Erba. The zebra stallion was born to the political elite of Seguro, coming from a long line and venerated lineage of councillors and bureaucrats. His ancestor had gained fame as Sínora Pon's camp-aide. Through his family, Lûa knew Mansu Erba from his childhood and, in turn, the First Commander found him to be a sharp-minded colt.\n\nAfter an education overseas in Macawia, Lûa attempted to pursue a career in the burgeoning civil service yet a single letter changed his life; an invitation from the First Commander to become her secretary. A position that he accepted at once. This led Lûa Ramedi to Kásan politics, aiding Mansu in drafting speeches and legislation amongst other tasks where his dutifulness didn't go unnoticed. Through Mansu, his name gained prominence amongst the councillors and as the old First Commander continued to rely on him more, the writing on the wall was clear — Lûa Ramedi was Mansu Erba's designated successor."
zes_candidates_info_screen_pasarinha_text:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd August 956 in Ilha Rosca\n\n§YBiography§!:To many in Kása, Pasarinha's life embodies the prospect of individual opportunity offered by the free society. Born in the poorer district of Ilha Rosca, not much is known about his early life. Only thing known for certain is that as just a colt, he worked on various ships as a deckhand until growing into a fully fledged sailor. While his early life was spent on board merchant and cargo ships, he soon was allured to serve in the expanding Kásan naval task force. Pasarinha has himself credits the navy for 'beating the worst out of him.' His naval career led him far away from the safe shores and trade routes to the high seas and shores of northern Zebrica in pursuit of pirates and slavers. Over time, he showed his prowess as a stallion capable of assessing situations calmly. He did rose to rank of terceiro-sargento in 981 and in an engagement in that same year would lead him to temporarily taking over as a captain of a destroyer. His excellent conduct and bravery in this emergency led him to be awarded. But even as he was given a chance to enroll into a naval academy, to everyone's surprise Pasarinha declined the honour and simply asked to be allowed to finish his tour.\n\nOnce decommissioned and back in Kása in the year 983, Pasarinha did not remain idle. Using his experience, past and few connections, he formed the South-North Corporation, a cargo company specialized upon transporting goods between Kása and Macawia. His iron-will and shrewd dealings allowed him to not just survive the competition against the well-established companies but thrive. It was also in then Pasarinha made his debut into the upper-echelons of Kásan society, where his direct manners and titular pipe made him a known figure. By the beginning of 990s, Pasarinha stood amongst the richest of Kása.\n\nAll this culminated in his election as the councillor of Ilha Rosca in the election of 991 by the backing of not just the local business magnates but also many common citizens. In the council he became a voice for modernisation of Kása. Culmination of this was the adoption of his program titled Prudutu Projektu by Mansu Erba in 1000, which saw construction of the first railway lines around Seguro."
zes_candidates_info_screen_yrmthu_text:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd July 979 in Oferclif, Bymnonia\n\n§YBiography§!:One cannot always tell a creature's fate based on their origins. Born to a family of Barrad refugees, Yrmthu's entire life has been shaped by events prior to her birth; while her family had been just simple serfs living in the Barrad valleys, the crisis caused by the Pentarchy's rise led to her parents only narrowingly escaping the chaos. Her childhood was spent growing up in Oferclif, where many refugees were settled by Kása. Although originally a Wittenlandic pony, speaking wittenlandic as her mother tongue, young Yrmthu learnt Kásan fast, enabling her to pursue rudimentary education in both languages. Despite showing prowess and intellect, she did not pursue higher education even when offered the chance. She instead began to aid her fellow refugees in anyway she could. Over the years her focus moved to coordinating the aid efforts and acting as a middle-mare between the government and camp representatives.\n\nIt was during her work that Yrmthu began to slowly develop an unique political philosophy. She adored Kása's harmonic values of individual liberty and the democratic institution that ensured equality of all. Yet she saw the value of local communities and disliked how political capital was entirely centered in Seguro, with municipalities having little say in affairs that concerned themselves. Her localist ideology gained some ground in the northern states and culminated in her election to councilor of Oferclif in 999. Despite her reservations, Yrmthu was a staunchly loyalist to Mansu Erba's policies and kept her criticisms to the parlay rooms for most part. Her biggest political victory was the passage of the Petition Act in 1002 which enable local communities to directly petition the First Commander."
zes_candidates_info_screen_altu_text:0 "§YBorn§!: 18th February 966 in Baixio, Ilhas Lagosta\n\n§YBiography§!:If a Kásan was asked to name a single poet they know, then with a great chance they would say Áltu Kexa. The zebra mare is well-known and admired for her succinct yet poignant language which has won her great fame despite her somewhat eccentric behaviour.\n\nYet her origins is far more tragic; born to poor farming family in Ilhas Lagosta, it was even a miracle that Áltu learned to read thanks to her attentive parents. Already in youth, her experience with hardships molded her to be strong in her convictions yet she never grew to resent the simple, poor way of life. Her evenings were filled by listening to her grandparents stories about the past, how her ancestors had been fought on D'Vash with Akeeku and how her great-grandmother had fought under Sinóra Pon against the crusaders. It was from these tales that Áltu, from an early age, yearned to be something more than just a farmer — she wished to be a soldier. Only for a polio outbreak to crush Áltu's dreams, leaving her with semi-crippled back legs and in need to use wheel-aids to walk.\n\nBut instead of falling to the wayside, Áltu Kexa found writing a way to vent her feelings. Even without any education, she consumed any literature, aided in this by her frequent visits to a medical facility in Seguro. Life in the capital gave her a chance to see a different side of Kása and it horrified her; where there had been compassion and friendship between others back home, there was only fights and crime in the industrial slums. It was this squalor that she attacked in her writing. Her breakthrough came, oddly enough, when an affluent pony hired her to recite her work at a party. What came to be known as 'The Night of Fire' the poet instead read poems that mocked her rich listeners for their decadent luxury. The ensuing newspaper drama and a lawsuit led to her imprisonment. But Áltu simply continued to write inside the prison, aided in her work by a friendly jailor. After her time, she walked out to a cheering crowd. Áltu Kexa became a successful poet, with her work published for free for all to read, earning her living from public recitals. But despite her wealth, the zebra continued to live at her ancestral farm where she married the jailor who'd aided her and the couple had twins."

ZES_heart:0 "Chosen Heart"
ZES_heart_desc:0 "Born in the Crystal Empire, Chosen Heart found herself in a world on the precipice of upheaval. A survivor of Sombra's reign, and student of psychology, she found herself enslaved by the Dark King until the intervention of the Equestrian Princesses. Yet even on the Empire's return, even once a new Crystal Princess sat upon the throne, not all was well. The year was 1000, and to the west an endless horde of changelings conspired, while a famine to the east led ponies to rebel against Equestria. All while her fellow crystal ponies refused to acknowledge the turmoil brewing around them. Survivors of tyranny, unwilling to prevent others from suffering as they had.\n\nTravelling first to Canterlot, she found the same willful ignorance despite the weekly crises that struck even small towns. Growing disillusioned with her fellow ponies, she chose to strike out on her own. She travelled east across the great Celestial Sea to New Mareland, finding a colony just as incapable of helping those outside their borders. Unwilling to stand by, and with no other options, she began to wander Griffonia. Facing discrimination for her hooves and dulled coat, she found safety alongside a griffoness by the name of Gerina. Together they worked to rescue and aid the downtrodden with words, food, and finally liberation. Their journey ended in a caravan with those they had liberated, travelling to a small nation known as Kása.\n\nThe year was 1002, and Chosen Heart found herself in a world on the precipice of upheaval. Discovering her friend Gerina was part of the Kásan Skapatoria Programa, she chose to become a full citizen of Kása. Joining the Skapatoria herself, and marrying Gerina along the way, she rose swiftly through the ranks thanks to her talent and creative application of her psychology studies. Finally having found a place she could make a difference, she dedicated herself entirely to the Skapatoria's purpose: liberation for all. By 1006 she would find herself standing at the shoulder of A avo di Kása, Mansu Erba. Whispering reports and findings from Operação Liberdade into the beloved Grandmother of Kása's ear, clad in the white robes of her station as head of the Skapatoria. As the Kásan Advisory Counsel of 1007 loomed, the Light of Kása burned bright once more, held in crystalline hooves."

mansu_erba_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 7th May 931 in Seguro\n\n§YBiography§!:Born second child to a farmer family, Mansu Erba grew in the vast farmlands just outside the capital Seguro, spending her youth exploring nature. Unlike her peers, she and her siblings received basic education from their parents, learning to read and write. As Mansu's elder brother would inherit the farm, she had to find life elsewhere and so Mansu left for the capital, to live and work at a shop owned by relatives. However, this life was not to be as she enlisted in 950 in a Macawian military program which she graduated from in 954. As a sub-teniente, her cleverness earned her the attention of the Skapatoria Programa.\n\nFor three years, she worked as an undercover agent in Austurland, Wittenland and Nimbusia, where she helped many escaping to freedom. Mansu proved herself to be a capable operative and in 957, she rose to fame for her actions in Austurland as she lead the escape of over a hundred thralls despite taking a musket ball to her gut. She received a hero's welcome at Seguro and an award for her self-sacrifice from the First Commander. Sadly, the musket ball that made her a hero also prevented her from ever working as an operative again. At the hospital, the recovering zebra would meet her future husband, a widowed doctor, and the two would be married two years later. In 960 the Advisory Council elections saw Mansu chosen as a councillor of Seguro.\n\nWhile Kása had continued to prosper, in 967 the Barrad Crisis erupted. As streams of refugees trickled into Kása, the First Commander of the time suffered a stroke. As the crisis worsened, an emergency election in the council saw Mansu Erba narrowly elected as the First Commander. She acted swiftly, diverting all funds from industrialisation programs and appealing to Macawia for aid. Kása suffered from it but it endured, their founding ideals upheld as Mansu argued to the critics. After all, is a factory worth betraying oneself?\n\nDespite the hardships in the following decades, Kása chose to trust in its timely hero and under Mansu's leadership, Kása slowly recovered from the crisis thanks to extensive literacy and economic reform programs. Now, she is known as A avo di Kása —Kása's Grandmother.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Printik"

lua_ramedi_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th March 972 in Seguro\n\n§YBiography§!:Lûa Ramedi's political career has been defined by his service and loyalty to Mansu Erba. The zebra stallion was born to the political elite of Seguro, coming from a long line and venerated lineage of councillors and bureaucrats. His ancestor had gained fame as Sínora Pon's camp-aide. Through his family, Lûa knew Mansu Erba from his childhood and, in turn, the First Commander found him to be a sharp-minded colt.\n\nAfter an education overseas in Macawia, Lûa attempted to pursue a career in the burgeoning civil service yet a single letter changed his life; an invitation from the First Commander to become her secretary. A position that he accepted at once. This led Lûa Ramedi to Kásan politics, aiding Mansu in drafting speeches and legislation amongst other tasks where his dutifulness didn't go unnoticed. Through Mansu, his name gained prominence amongst the councillors and as the old First Commander continued to rely on him more, the writing on the wall was clear — Lûa Ramedi was Mansu Erba's designated successor.\n\nAfter Mansu Erba's sudden resignation and retirement, most of the Advisory Council flocked to Lûa Ramedi, to the stallion's surprise. During the election, he led a campaign centered around safeguarding Mansu Erba's heritage and, in the end, the former secretary's political connections and ableness proved their worth.\n\nNow, as the new First Commander, Lûa Ramedi seeks to continue the path paved by Mansu Erba in forming an unified Kása as a modern, democratic nation.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Bunnyshrubby"

pasarinha_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd August 956 in Ilha Rosca\n\n§YBiography§!:To many in Kása, Pasarinha's life embodies the prospect of individual opportunity offered by the free society. Born in the poorer district of Ilha Rosca, not much is known about his early life. Only thing known for certain is that as just a colt, he worked on various ships as a deckhand until growing into a fully fledged sailor. While his early life was spent on board merchant and cargo ships, he soon was allured to serve in the expanding Kásan naval task force. Pasarinha has himself credits the navy for 'beating the worst out of him.' His naval career led him far away from the safe shores to the high seas and shores of northern Zebrica in pursuit of pirates and slavers. Over time, he showed his prowess as a stallion capable of assessing situations calmly. He did rose to rank of terceiro-sargento in 981 and in an engagement in that same year would lead him to temporarily taking over as a captain of a destroyer. His excellent conduct and bravery in this emergency led him to be awarded. But even as he was given a chance to enroll into a naval academy, to everyone's surprise Pasarinha declined the honour and simply asked to be allowed to finish his tour.\n\nOnce decommissioned and back in Kása in the year 983, Pasarinha did not remain idle. Using his experience, past and few connections, he formed the South-North Corporation, a cargo company specialized upon transporting goods between Kása and Macawia. His iron-will and shrewd dealings allowed him to not just survive the competition against the well-established companies but thrive. It was also in then Pasarinha made his debut into the upper-echelons of Kásan society, where his direct manners and titular pipe made him a known figure. By the beginning of 990s, Pasarinha stood amongst the richest of Kása.\n\nAll this culminated in his election as the councillor of Ilha Rosca in the election of 991 by the backing of not just the local business magnates but also many common citizens. In the council he became a voice for modernisation of Kása. Culmination of this was the adoption of his program titled Prudutu Projektu by Mansu Erba in 1000, which saw construction of the first railway lines around Seguro. It wasn't a surprise that Pasarinha announced his candidacy following Mansu Erba's resignation and many voiced support for the self-made stallion of the future. While not the best public speaker, having never been one to like public spotlight, Pasarinha showed the quality of his character on the election tour. Now, as the new First Commander, he has his plans set for Kása; ones that will secure its existence for generations to come.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kajko"

yrmthu_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd July 979 in Oferclif, Bymnonia\n\n§YBiography§!:One cannot always tell a creature's fate based on their origins. Born to a family of Barrad refugees, Yrmthu's entire life has been shaped by events prior to her birth; while her family had been just simple serfs living in the Barrad valleys, the crisis caused by the Pentarchy's rise led to her parents only narrowingly escaping the chaos. Her childhood was spent growing up in Oferclif, where many refugees were settled by Kása. Although originally a Wittenlandic pony, speaking Wittenlandic as her mother tongue, young Yrmthu learnt Kásan fast, enabling her to pursue rudimentary education in both languages. Despite showing prowess and intellect, she did not pursue higher education even when offered the chance. She instead began to aid her fellow refugees in anyway she could. Over the years her focus moved to coordinating the aid efforts and acting as a middle-mare between the government and camp representatives.\n\nIt was during her work that Yrmthu began to slowly develop an unique political philosophy. She adored Kása's harmonic values of individual liberty and the democratic institution that ensured equality of all. Yet she saw the value of local communities and disliked how political capital was entirely centered in Seguro, with municipalities having little say in affairs that concerned themselves. Her localist ideology gained some ground in the northern states and culminated in her election to councilor of Oferclif in 999. Despite her reservations, Yrmthu was a staunchly loyalist to Mansu Erba's policies and kept her criticisms to the parlay rooms for most part. Her biggest political victory was the passage of the Petition Act in 1002 which enable local communities to directly petition the First Commander.\n\nWhen Mansu Erba retired, Yrmthu did not initially intend to run, feeling her position wasn't entirely secure. But when a group of fellow localist councillors approached her and pledged to aid her, she couldn't deny their request. With their aid and her campaign tour's success, her election saw a turning point in Kása's history; for the first time, a non-zebra was the First Commander. And in her new position, she intend to reform not simply Kásan politics but the society itself.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Printik"

altu_kexa_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 18th February 966 in Baixio, Ilhas Lagosta\n\n§YBiography§!:If a Kásan was asked to name a single poet they know, then with a great chance they would say Áltu Kexa. The zebra mare is well-known and admired for her succinct yet poignant language which has won her great fame despite her somewhat eccentric behaviour.\n\nYet her origins is far more tragic; born to poor farming family in Ilhas Lagosta, it was even a miracle that Áltu learned to read thanks to her attentive parents. Already in youth, her experience with hardships molded her to be strong in her convictions yet she never grew to resent the simple, poor way of life. Her evenings were filled by listening to her grandparents stories about the past, how her ancestors had been fought on D'Vash with Akeeku and how her great-grandmother had fought under Sinóra Pon against the crusaders. It was from these tales that Áltu, from an early age, yearned to be something more than just a farmer — she wished to be a soldier. Only for a polio outbreak to crush Áltu's dreams, leaving her with semi-crippled back legs and in need to use wheel-aids to walk.\n\nBut instead of falling to the wayside, Áltu Kexa found writing a way to vent her feelings. Even without any education, she consumed any literature, aided in this by her frequent visits to a medical facility in Seguro. Life in the capital gave her a chance to see a different side of Kása and it horrified her; where there had been compassion and friendship between others back home, there was only fights and crime in the industrial slums. It was this squalor that she attacked in her writing. Her breakthrough came, oddly enough, when an affluent pony hired her to recite her work at a party. What came to be known as 'The Night of Fire' the poet instead read poems that mocked her rich listeners for their decadent luxury. The ensuing newspaper drama and a lawsuit led to her imprisonment. But Áltu simply continued to write inside the prison, aided in her work by a friendly jailor. After her time, she walked out to a cheering crowd. Áltu Kexa became a successful poet, with her work published for free for all to read, earning her living from public recitals. But despite her wealth, the zebra continued to live at her ancestral farm where she married the jailor who'd aided her and the couple had twins.\n\nÁltu Kexa has decried politicians as paper tigers. So when she announced her candidacy, there was confusion. But her fiery speeches struck a chord in the masses and now she plans to reforge Kása and show where her place is in the world; as a guardian of the oppressed and enemy of tyrants.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kajko"

ZES_solano_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: December 16th, 965, Ilha Rosca\n\n§YBiography§!: Born to a zebra mother and a pony father, Solano Lobu was born in interesting times. Two years after his birth, the Barrad crisis erupted in Kása. Lobu's father, a low-level government worker, was swamped with work and didn't get to spend much time with his son. Constantly advocating for assisting the refugees, showing charity, and doing everything he could to improve their lives. So, Solano spent most of his early years with his mother. She was a proud citizen and instilled in him an admiration for all those doing their part to serve the freedom Kása offered to all, including his father.\n\nIn order to follow on this legacy, Solano signed up for military training in Macawia, hoping to return and serve his nation proudly. After his stint at a Macawian military academy, where he performed excellently, he returned to his home of Ilha Rosca and became its local militia coordinator. He was happy with his domestic service, but little did he know, people higher up had their eyes on him.\n\nIn 991, Mansu Erba tapped the local commander to begin organizing the national network of militias in Kása into something that could be called an army. Solano accepted this duty, and continues his work to this day. While having little combat experience, he is a master organizer and logistician, and hopes with all his heart that his work can benefit his proud nation in some way.\n\n§CHis father is very proud of him.§!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Sesek"

ZES_wojtek_desc:0 "§gDepending from where in the world does one hail, bears are either simple animals or a race of arrogant warriors. There are exceptions of course, but Wojtek is unique even among those.\n\n Little is known of his past, and the bear himself is unwilling to tell. This and countless rumors, have turned Wojtek into somewhat of a pseudo-mythical figure. What is known is that Wojtek is a Gryphussian brown bear, a species hunted by Opinicus knights for sport. When he was but a cub, Wojtek lost his mother to Opinicus hunters and would have been slain himself, but was saved by Gryphussian partisans from Kasa.This band of guerrillas adopted the bear, giving him the name "Wojtek". However, during an engagement, the bear was separated from the unit.\n\nYears later griffon refugees in Kasa would start telling strange stories of a bear who would protect Gryphussians fleeing the Free Towns. Similar tales would come from partisans who claimed a great ursine was slaying their enemies with a cannon it wielded as if it was a mere rifle. The leadership of Kasa would remain sceptical however, until the so called "Liberator Bear" himself arrived into Kása one day. He introduced himself as Wojtek and pledged to fight for the Kása Free State in order to help liberating the Gryphussians - his nation and saving the brown bears - his species.\n\nWhile initially reluctantly accepted into the Kasan military as a private, Wojtek was quickly promoted into the position of corporal and eventually into the ranks of generals, due to physical ability, mental fortitude, unexpected expertise in artillery and surprisingly for a such a predator - great care for soldiers serving under him.\n\nWojtek now stands as one of the lesser unifying figures of Gryphussians in Kasa, who now believe that liberation of their homeland is at claw as even it's nature is turning against it's oppressors.§!"

ZES_amaltia_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th February 954 near Asbolus, Wingbardy\n\n§YBiography§!: Amaltia's life followed the path of many from rural Wingbardy before the collapse of the Empire. Her family had been farmers and soldiers for generations, scraping out a living on their homestead. Her family had few sympathies for the Imperial monarchy, and so when Wingbardy broke away, they rejoiced, and patriotism among them and the other residents of their small village was high. Then came the backlash. Wingbardy's economic prosperity began to slip, and the nation began to slip into darker times. And so, with its promises of good pay and food, Amaltia decided to join up with the army. Her basic training was relatively uneventful, but then came the year 985. Amaltia was nearby when the first skirmishes of the Falcor War began, and her unit saw some of the harshest fighting of the war. It was around this time when Amaltia became disillusioned with these wars of monarchs' claims in pursuit of glory and prestige. Because of this, when the war ended she retired from the military, by now a relatively well-decorated officer. And with that, she thought she would live her life out in peace with her siblings at their family farm.\n\n§GUntil that is, she took a vacation.§! \n\nAmaltia was recruited by the Wingbardian military to go on a diplomatic mission to the islands of Asterion. While there, a visit to a bar turned dangerous when she began to drunkenly rant about her hatred for the monarchy, after which she knew she couldn't go back. Luckily, there was a fly on the wall at the bar that night.\n\nAn operative of Kása's Skapatoria Program visited her room that night and made her an offer. Get out now and use her experience to fight for something new, something greater. A nation of creatures striving together for democracy. And she signed up.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: MonAx"

ZES_tomaz_tauronowski_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: September 17th 966, Gryphus\n\n§YBiography§!: Kása is a strange country but it is a good country to creatures like Tomasz. A gryphisian-born minotaur, he was captured by zebra pirates on a cruise to Colthage before being rescued by the Kása Sea Patrol. In his gratitude and appreciation for the good deed, he settled to a village near Oferclif and began working as a farm-aide. A few years later he enlisted into Oferclif's militia. His good wits allowed him to rise to the status of platoon commander and everything stayed relatively calm until one fateful day.\n\nHe, with other volunteer militia, were training by the coast near of Aebbercurnig when they spotted two Austurlandish ships headed their way. Filled to the brim with vikingars, the ships aimed to plunder local villages and capture slaves. Tomasz and his unit didn't have a way to inform any near post so they settled a nearby hill and fought. The battle lasted for few hours, with the militia keeping their spirit under Tomasz and taking potshots at their disorganized and far more poorly equipped foes. One galley even had a catapult which lobbed stones upon them. One such rock landed near Tomasz and shattered into shards, shredding his body. Inspired by the moment Tomasz grabbed his own boulder and tossed it down into the attackers. By pure luck it crushed the raid leader under it and the remaining raiders retreated with no loot or slaves.\n\nFor his actions, bravery and leadership, Tomasz was awarded with a recognition and a scholarship to study in a Macawian military academy. In Bymnonia, he is widely known for his nickname "the Defender" and he wields the title with great pride.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Bunnyshrubby"

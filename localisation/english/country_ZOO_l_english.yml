 ZOO_regency_1_desc:0 "Under the regent-mother's rule, Zongo has maintained a delicate balance between the old ways and the undercurrents of change. The regency period is marked by cautious governance, characterized by a conservative approach to internal affairs and diplomacy. While this has ensured a stable rule, it has also led to a lack of significant progress and innovation."

 ZOO_untapped_potential_1_desc:0 "Zongo is a land of untapped riches, both in terms of natural resources and human potential. However, for the last millenia, these resources have remained largely underexploited. The current approach of economic policy has led to an economic stagnation, with traditional tribal agriculture prevailing over modern economic ventures. The local populace, while resourceful and resilient, lacks access to modern education and healthcare, which impedes the kingdom's overall development. As a result, Zongo stands at a crossroads, rich in potential but constrained by a lack of innovation and modern infrastructure to cross the jungles."

 ### Events ###
 zongo.1.t:0 "The Confirmation" #SIREN
 zongo.1.desc:0 "The Ceremony Hall at the University of İlkşehir was packed.  It was filled to the brim with centaurs, zebras, and a myriad of other creatures alike. To him, it almost looked like a dress rehearsal for his coronation. He smiled at the thought. Years of study and work had brought him to this moment. Soon, very soon, he would finally put all that learning to good use.\n\n"And for our next recipient," his ears twitched as the Rector began to speak from the stage, "I humbly introduce one of our top students. He who has worked tirelessly for this distinction, and elevated our prestige tenfold: Crown-Prince Akidu Bomboko!" At the cue, Akidu walked onto the stage with his head held high as the applause washed over him. He stopped in front of the Rector, an aged centaur who looked down at him with pride.\n\n"Prince Bomboko. Your treatise in the employment of railways to allow for rapid modernization has not gone unnoticed. You have not only enriched this institution, but the sphere of economic theory as a whole. So," the centaur moved a hand to the podium, where he grasped on to a small, round pin emblazoned with the horned emblem of the university. "It is with great honor that I now grant you the title of Doctor.” He bent down, and the pin was clipped onto the lapel of Akidu's suit. "Now, if you would like to say a few words?"\n\nAkidu couldn't help himself from grinning. "Why, I would!" he said with a chuckle as he climbed a few steps up to the podium. A sea of faces stretched out before him. "To say that I am immensely honored to receive this distinction would be an understatement. İlkşehir has been nothing but kind to me, and has taught me so much more than I ever thought there was to learn. I will not forget this, and neither will Zongo. I thank you all who have helped me on this journey. Because of you all-""

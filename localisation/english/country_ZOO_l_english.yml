However, for the last millenia, these resources have remained largely underexploited. The current approach of economic policy has led to an economic stagnation, with traditional tribal agriculture prevailing over modern economic ventures. The local populace, while resourceful and resilient, lacks access to modern education and healthcare, which impedes the kingdom's overall development. As a result, Zongo stands at a crossroads, rich in potential but constrained by a lack of innovation and modern infrastructure to cross the jungles."

 zongo.1.t:0 "The Confirmation" #SIREN
 zongo.1.desc:0 "The Ceremony Hall at the University of İlkşehir was packed.  It was filled to the brim with centaurs, zebras, and a myriad of other creatures alike. To him, it almost looked like a dress rehearsal for his coronation. He smiled at the thought. Years of study and work had brought him to this moment. Soon, very soon, he would finally put all that learning to good use.\n\n"And for our next recipient," his ears twitched as the Rector began to speak from the stage, "I humbly introduce one of our top students. He who has worked tirelessly for this distinction, and elevated our prestige tenfold: Crown-Prince Akida Bomboko!" At the cue, Akida walked onto the stage with his head held high as the applause washed over him. He stopped in front of the Rector, an aged centaur who looked down at him with pride.\n\n"Prince Bomboko. Your treatise in the employment of railways to allow for rapid modernization has not gone unnoticed. You have not only enriched this institution, but the sphere of economic theory as a whole. So," the centaur moved a hand to the podium, where he grasped on to a small, round pin emblazoned with the horned emblem of the university. "It is with great honor that I now grant you the title of Doctor.” He bent down, and the pin was clipped onto the lapel of Akida's suit. "Now, if you would like to say a few words?"\n\nAkida couldn't help himself from grinning. "Why, I would!" he said with a chuckle as he climbed a few steps up to the podium. A sea of faces stretched out before him. "To say that I am immensely honored to receive this distinction would be an understatement. İlkşehir has been nothing but kind to me, and has taught me so much more than I ever thought there was to learn. I will not forget this, and neither will Zongo. I thank you all who have helped me on this journey. Because of you all-""

 zongo.2.t:0 "Saying Goodbye" #SIREN
 zongo.2.desc:0 "The sun set on the cafe. Akida watched the sky turn to red as he fully understood the magnitude of going home. Home. Where he had not set hoof since his father's death. Where his mother ruled in his stead. He was practically a colt when he left, barely able to grapple with his grief. He would return a stallion now. For the first time he began to feel anxious anticipation in how he would be received after so long.\n\n"That frown doesn't suit you very well." Akida took his eyes off the sky and to the zebra in front of him, who smirked back. Zyles was a brilliant stallion who hailed from the other side of the continent. They had been steadfast friends for years. His heart panged. The prince smiled, "I am simply practicing my noble disposition."\n\n"Sure, if looking as if you've just eaten a lemon counts," Zyles picked at his half-finished food, "but I have a feeling His Highness isn't telling me the whole truth."\n\nAkida sighed. "I suppose I am realizing just how much of my life I have spent here. I have walked these streets so long, and made so many memories here, that leaving feels as if I'm leaving home all over again." He smiled sheepishly, "Sounds rather foalish now that I say it out loud, doesn't it?"\n\n"Not at all, friend. I know I'll miss you." Zyles paused in taught, before tapping his hoof on the table. He bent down to his bag, where he took out a small book. "My latest has just been released- fresh off the presses as it were. Take this as a going-away gift. So you don't forget me," he winked, "I wouldn't mind you passing my name around when you've taken the throne, either."\n\nHis face lit up in joy, before smiling softly. "I-I don't know what to say, I'm touched." Akida looked down at the book, and read the title printed in large, glossy letters:"

 zongo.5.t:0 "Gathering the Council" 
 zongo.5.desc:0 "King Akidu stood before the great door, ignoring the confused looks of his royal guards. He just needed a moment to collect himself before passing over that last threshold.\n\nIt was one thing to dream of what he would do, given his father’s power. It was a very different thing to be stepping into the actual nitty-gritty of governance. In the room beyond, his council had finally gathered, each with their own agendas, beliefs, loyalties beyond their fealty to the throne.His dreams of a modern Zongo would have to endure them all. He licked his dry lips, suddenly nervous. Inside, he could hear them arguing, bickering. It was like a hearing the first crash of thunder from an approaching storm.\n\nBut it passed. When he strode into the room, he looked each one of them in the eye. His old teacher, beaming with pride. Ayana, the unreadable shaman from the northern tribes known for their advocacy for the common zebra. Dikembe, a stern faced aristocrat chosen by his peers to assert their ancient privileges. The past, the present, and the future, all in one room."

Akidu didn’t blame him—the day had been short on answers and long on complicated analysis. The prognosis was not grim, but it was also not promising.\n\nThe King had called for a break for lunch, and his closest advisors had joined him on a balcony overlooking the capitol. They’d talked, and eaten, and then talked again. The conversation spiraled into arguments over and over.\n\n“I just don’t see a way to balance our priorities here without compromising one of them,” Anarbek said at last. “It’s the old problem of nation-building. Guns or bread.”\n\n“One of those seems more important,” Ayana said flatly. Dikembe snorted.\n\n“We do not need the King to send his officers door to door making sure every foal has the right amount of bread,” he groused. “The world is dangerous, and we are weak. We need modern weapons. We’ve survived for a thousand years without the royal dole.”\n\n“And in the intervening years, the population of Zongo has exploded,” Anarbek cut in, breaking hs reverie. “A strong nation needs strong foundations, Councillor Dikembe. Look to Equestria’s example, in the early Solarian Reforms! The—”\n\nThe noblezebra cut him off with a growl. “I do not want to be lectured, centaur. Equestria, Griffons, Centaurs, whoever! This is Zongo. And Zongo does not need someone else’s answer.” He looked suddenly, pointedly to the king, who was still weighing the numbers in his mind as he stared down at his plate. “And only one zebra can give us Zongo’s answer.”"

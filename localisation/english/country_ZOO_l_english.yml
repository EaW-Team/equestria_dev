 ##intro
 zoo_the_homecoming:0 "The Arrival"
 zoo_the_homecoming_desc:0 "Long ago when the kingdom nearly exploded with unrest, Prince Akida was sent away for his own safety... and more importantly, to learn the way of governance in peace. Now, word has arrived of his return to take his rightful place on the throne. With the Prince's so-loved subjects of economics and locomotives taking center stage during his time abroad, a new era for Zongo is sure to unfold."
 zoo_gathering_the_council:0 "Gather The Council"
 zoo_gathering_the_council_desc:0 "Long serving as an advisory body to the kings of Zongo, the Royal Council has found itself powerless at the whims of the monarchy more times than not. With Akida coming to power, his disinterest in politicking has made for good bedmates with the council, finally granting them an opportunity to be more than just a formality."
 zoo_homecoming_celebrations:0 "Celebrate The Homecoming"
 zoo_homecoming_celebrations_desc:0 "Finally, the prince has come back to his homeland, celebrations must ensue! Even if he seems a bit disinterested, the Mother-Queen has ensured this will serve as a good opportunity to get ingratiated with the rest of the country's elite, leaving Akida little choice."
 zoo_send_for_specialists:0 "Send For Specialists"
 zoo_send_for_specialists_desc:0 "Having spent the last few years mingling with the greatest minds of the Ancient Pact, prince Akida has found himself deeply displeased with the intelligentsia of his own homeland. To ensure his future plans proceed without issue, he will summon foreign experts to fill his halls. Of course, they'll be finely recompensed for their work."
 zoo_assure_the_chiefs:0 "Assure The Chiefs"
 zoo_assure_the_chiefs_desc:0 "The last thing Akida wants are chieftains bothering his plans for the nation, even if he dislikes having to talk to so many of them, it's better to make his goals clear now so as to not face problems in the future."
 zoo_talk_to_mother:0 "A Talk With Mother"
 zoo_talk_to_mother_desc:0 "Nzuzi Bomboko. Queen-Regent, mother to the Crown-Prince, and widow to the late king. In Akida's absence it was she who held on to the reigns of power for him to inherit. With his coronation fast approaching, an official meeting on the matters of state between them is all but necessary for a smooth royal transition."
 zoo_prepare_the_coronation:0 "Prepare The Coronation"
 zoo_prepare_the_coronation_desc:0 "With Akida having spent a few weeks in Zongo's shores, preparations for his formal coronation must be readied, all that's left is to see how much will be spent on it." 
 zoo_new_budget:0 "Plan The Budget"
 zoo_new_budget_desc:0 "More important than any of the politicking that has happened until now, prince Akida has called for his economic specialists to gather and ready the budget for the prince's plans. No corners can be cut in his ambition, no matter how many numbers have to be crunched."
 zoo_talk_to_the_church:0 "Meet with the Church"
 zoo_talk_to_the_church_desc:0 "Out of the many important figures he has had to meet, the last ones for him to meet are the church. Once this meeting is done, Akida will finally be free to work on his plans. He only hopes this old zebra will not be as pandering and convoluted as all others he met... dealing with a religious type, that'll probably prove impossible." 
 zoo_the_coronation:0 "The Coronation"
 zoo_the_coronation_desc:0 "Beat the drums! Prepare the feast! Gather all zebras to Zongo! The last day of Prince Akida has come; today, a King is born! Long live King Akida! Long live Zongo!"
 zoo_enact_the_railroad_plan:0 "Commence The Railroad Plan"
 zoo_enact_the_railroad_plan_desc:0 "With all the formalities and petty politicking that comes with becoming king, Akida is finally free to get his hooves dirty with what he truly always wished for: trains! He envisions locomotives traveling to every corner of the nation, connecting the people and trade wherever they go. Zongo will taste modernity at last!"

 ##Railway program tree
 zoo_railway_1_1:0 "Found an University of Economics"
 zoo_railway_1_1_desc:0 "Having spent the last few years at the University of Economics of Ilkşehir, it's a natural step to want to bring the same innovations he was able to live through to his subjects. One day perhaps, Zongo will be filled with minds dreaming even larger dreams than his own."
 zoo_railway_2_1:0 "Moving Beyond Primitive Theory"
 zoo_railway_2_1_desc:0 "The zebras of Zongo do not live; they survive day to day but never thrive. If he ever hopes to modernise this country, Zongo must go past this lifestyle and develop a modern economy that may serve to create a modern nation."
 zoo_railway_2_2:0 "Invoke Eminent Domain"
 zoo_railway_2_2_desc:0 "Many of the lands where our rails are being built are traditionally owned by the chieftains and their villages, proving a bit of a headache for any construction effort. To ensure all goes smoothly, the crown will compensate the relevant creatures so they can just build over the land without having to skirt around them, saving a great deal of time."
 zoo_railway_3_1:0 "Proclaim Necessity For National Defence"
 zoo_railway_3_1_desc:0 ""
 zoo_railway_3_2:0 "Implement Import-Substitution"
 zoo_railway_3_2_desc:0 "Too much of our fledgling economy has been based around depending on foreign materials and work, when Zongo itself is rich in many resources. If we are ever to truly modernise, we must learn to depend on ourselves, not on others."
 zoo_railway_3_3:0 "Proclaim Necessity For People's Welfare"
 zoo_railway_3_3_desc:0 ""
 zoo_railway_4_1:0 "Entice Foreign Scientists"
 zoo_railway_4_1_desc:0 "His school of economics has proven itself a great success, but it is currently very understaffed, with the king himself occasionally giving more complex lectures o scout out potential aides. To ensure the quality of our teachings remains high, Akida will once again call for bright minds to come to Zongo, willing to pay their knowledge's worth in gold." 
 zoo_railway_4_2:0 "Secure The Railways"
 zoo_railway_4_2_desc:0 "Bandit attacks taking advantage of our construction crews and passing trains have been a problem for way too long. To ensure this does not happen anymore, we will ensure all freight trains have an armored car for protection ensuring our railways are safer."
 zoo_railway_5_1:0 "Study Developmentalist Theory"
 zoo_railway_5_1_desc:0 "One concept that always interested Akida in university was Developmentalism. To grow an underdeveloped nation, one must foster their market variety and put heavy tariffs upon foreign goods. To ensure Zongo's continued economic independence, maybe taking inspirations from such measures would be best."
 zoo_railway_6_1:0 "Public Access To Railways"
 zoo_railway_6_1_desc:0 "With our railway network now spanning our entire mainland, the time has come to open several public lines to ensure easier transport for the average Zebra seeking to cross our land."
 zoo_railway_6_2:0 "Bonuses For On-Time Construction"
 zoo_railway_6_2_desc:0 "With our economy now more developed, our subjects now depend on currency more than any other trade or barter. To ensure our construction crews get the projects done on time, paying them bonuses seems to have a boost in productivity. Sometimes complex questions have really easy answers."
 zoo_railway_7_1:0 "Zongolese Developmentalism"
 zoo_railway_7_1_desc:0 "The theories of Developmentalism have been utilised to great effect, however, it is clear that there have been consequences to it. Perhaps loosening some of their ideas to better fit our subjects would ensure it reaches its maximum potential, after all, zebras aren't just numbers." 
 zoo_railway_8_1:0 "Caring For The Vulnerable"
 zoo_railway_8_1_desc:0 "We have made great strides with our economic development, the locomotives proving themselves up to the King's expectations. With our economy at an all-time high, perhaps we may ensure that no Zebra goes hungry again through government assistance. A nation is defined by how their poorest creatures live, this is surely the right way to go."
 zoo_railway_8_2:0 "Decrease Deficit Spending"
 zoo_railway_8_2_desc:0 "We have made great strides with our economic development, the locomotives proving themselves up to the King's expectations. With our economy at an all-time high, the Queen-Mother advises us to cut some corners to ensure more profit is made. More money means more investments, this is surely the right way to go."
 zoo_railway_9_1:0 "Zongo Connected By Rail"
 zoo_railway_9_1_desc:0 "Akida could not be prouder of what he has seen. Whistles and smoke fill the sky as locomotives connect every corner of our mainland. From Zamu to Zuba, from Zupinamba to Zongo, all have bore witness to the great successes of modernity and to the genius of our King."

 ##Industrial tree
 zoo_industrial_1_1:0 "Create Zamu Industrial Center"
 zoo_industrial_1_1_desc:0 "With its vast plains, Zamu is the prime location to develop our nascent industry. We will form an industrial center to better direct and kickstart our developments in the region."
 zoo_industrial_2_1:0 "Fund Tungsten Research"
 zoo_industrial_2_1_desc:0 "Tungsten has long been overlooked as a strategic material in Zongo due to its limited uses, however, with new ages of construction and production having reached the world, tungsten finds itself ever more valuable. It would be wise to open new mines to better exploit their potential."
 zoo_industrial_2_2:0 "Refurb Zmpangu Weapon Forges"
 zoo_industrial_2_2_desc:0 "TODO"
 zoo_industrial_3_1:0 "Fund Crystal Research"
 zoo_industrial_3_1_desc:0 "Magic crystals have long been overlooked in Zongo due to their limited uses, however, with the advent of magical weapons and other arcane uses, crystals find themselves ever more valuable.  It would be wise to open new mines to better exploit their potential"
 zoo_industrial_3_2:0 "Expand Zmpangu Mines"
 zoo_industrial_3_2_desc:0 "TODO"
 zoo_industrial_3_3:0 "Open Up To Foreign Interests"
 zoo_industrial_3_3_desc:0 "Our economy has been closed to foreign exports for too long. With our surplus of natural resources, Zongo has much to gain by trading with any who will pay. "
 zoo_industrial_4_1:0 "Expand Arms Facilities"
 zoo_industrial_4_1_desc:0 "TODO"
 zoo_industrial_4_2:0 "Construct New Industrial Parks"
 zoo_industrial_4_2_desc:0 "TODO"
 zoo_industrial_5_1:0 "Prioritize Goods Production"
 zoo_industrial_5_1_desc:0 "TODO"
 zoo_industrial_5_2:0 "Prioritize Arms Production"
 zoo_industrial_5_2_desc:0 "TODO"
 zoo_industrial_6_1:0 "Zongo's Industrial Revolution"
 zoo_industrial_6_1_desc:0 "King Akida has performed the miracle of the century! Once a backward country like its neighbors, Zongo has burst onto the international scene as the world's fastest-growing economy! Others cannot help but bask in awe as the news spreads of the successes of the young King." 

 ##Politics/research tree
 zoo_research_1_1:0 "Review The System Of Chieftains"
 zoo_research_1_1_desc:0 "While nominally loyal to the king, the decentralization of our system has led to chieftains holding great authority within their domains, leading to corruption and stagnation of lands that could be better utilized. Perhaps it's time to use our authority and remind them who's in charge."
 zoo_research_2_1:0 "Urban Literacy Programs"
 zoo_research_2_1_desc:0 "Even inside our largest settlements, illiteracy is a common problem, with only a limited few such as clergy members and those who can afford to study being able to read. The head of faith has proposed a four-step plan to ensure the whole country can read; counting with the help of the church as teachers. We'll start these reforms in the urban centers and see how well they work."
 zoo_research_2_2:0 "A System Of Royal Law"
 zoo_research_2_2_desc:0 "Our country currently lacks a formal legal system. The only guaranteed right is freedom from enslavement, with other matters handled on a case-by-case basis. This system is ineffective, so we will be formalising a system of royal law to better encompass all of Zongo."
 zoo_research_3_1:0 "Rural Literacy Programs"
 zoo_research_3_1_desc:0 "With literacy programs being a success among the cities, Ayana's plan seems to be working. The next step is to ensure they reach our more isolated and rural communities to ensure they are also literate."
 zoo_research_3_2:0 "Programs For The Poor"
 zoo_research_3_2_desc:0 "Our focus on the grand railroad project has led some communities to end displaced, especially the most vulnerable members of our society. To ensure we do not harm our people more than help them, programs to assist the poor will be set up so they may once again stand on their hooves."
 zoo_research_3_3:0 "Limits Of Emergency Rule"
 zoo_research_3_3_desc:0 "TODO"
 zoo_research_4_1:0 "No Peasant Mare Left Behind"
 zoo_research_4_1_desc:0 "With our literacy programs succeeding in both the cities and rural communities, one might think we're done. However, the poorest and marginalized of society cannot be forgotten. As part of our four step plan, even the most unfortunate among us will have the opportunity to read and write so they may have a better chance!"
 zoo_research_4_2:0 "A 1 on 1 With The Church"
 zoo_research_4_2_desc:0 "To ensure the church is onboard with our plans, the king has arranged a one-on-one meeting with Ayana so they can talk it out. While the Queen-Mother told him she could go in his stead, Akida ensured this is something he must do to learn more as a king."
 zoo_research_4_3:0 "The Mobilization Decree"
 zoo_research_4_3_desc:0 "The world of today is filled with too many wars to keep up with, if Zongo is not careful it may soon find itself swept away by them too. With the unification of zebrakind seemingly more and more relevant to the current world context, Zongo cannot be caught off-guard. If any will unify the Southeast, it will be us; for that, our soldiers must be ready."
 zoo_research_4_4:0 "Encourage Chieftains To Join The Court"
 zoo_research_4_4_desc:0 "Akida does not wish to get rid of the Chieftains, even if many of them seem to fear that for some reason. To showcase his willingness to work together, he'll invite any who can benefit his efforts to officially join the court as his advisors."
 zoo_research_4_4_tt:0 "Unlock several new Chieftain advisors"
 zoo_research_5_1:0 "Syncretism Between Church And State"
 zoo_research_5_1_desc:0 "TODO"
 zoo_research_5_2:0 "Religious-Secular Education Pact"
 zoo_research_5_2_desc:0 "With clergy-creatures serving as teachers in our primary schools, it's essential for them to remember that faith and literacy are not all they teach now, but formal sciences. While some may grumble, Akida and Ayana have already drafted the standards they must follow."
 zoo_research_5_3:0 "Queen Mother's Advice"
 zoo_research_5_3_desc:0 "TODO"
 zoo_research_6_1:0 "Zongo's Modern Constitution"
 zoo_research_6_1_desc:0 "Zongo has come a long way from the outdated state it found itself in just a few years ago. To formalize all the changes since then, the royal legal code will be adapted into a modern constitution! Queen-Mother has been warning about the risks of formalising certain limits to monarchical power, but Akida knows she's being overzealous as always; he hopes she'll feel calmer once this goes through."
 zoo_research_6_1_tt:0 "High influence of the Queen-mother during the signing of the constitution may have unintended consequences!"






 ##Sambovato tree
 zoo_sambovato_1_1:0 "Import Through The Nacre Gate"
 zoo_sambovato_1_1_desc:0 "The Nacre Gate is a busy shipping lane, connecting Chisimbi to the rest of the world and serving as a vital trade hub between all the Southeast nations and the Ancient Pact. With our treaty in place, we shall reap the benefits of cheaper imports to further our industrialisation efforts."
 zoo_sambovato_2_1:0 "Attend A Royal Party"
 zoo_sambovato_2_1_desc:0 "For a royal, social meetings are key, be they balls, dinners or other social events, they serve as an opportunity to forge connections, ensure allies remain satisfied and show your own etiquette to others... King Akida hates all of this. However, to ensure he is not disrespectful to our new allies, he will join Queen Ceyda Vatosoa for a party to better cement our alliance."
 zoo_sambovato_2_2:0 "Share Policing Methods"
 zoo_sambovato_2_2_desc:0 "We wish to show Queen Ceyda Vatosoa that our industrialisation efforts are not only useful for economical needs, but they may also directly help protect the country. As a gift to commemorate our alliance, we will be sending them a few of our armoured trains so they may see their effectiveness in action. After all, everyone knows mares love trains."
 zoo_sambovato_3_1:0 "Bind Sambovato Forever"
 zoo_sambovato_3_1_desc:0 "Railways cross across the island from Akoradriakarova to Tsenalakana, as factory lines produce non-stop and the harbours are busier than ever. Sambovato has truly grown much due to our efforts... their industry is now so tied to ours that they can never leave without risking total collapse. If their industry gets any more tied to ours, it would not be a lie to say that they might as well join Zongo." 


 ##Southern tree
 zoo_south_1_1:0 "Embrace Pan-Zongolese Culture"
 zoo_south_1_1_desc:0 "With the whole basin once again united under our flag, we should take advantage of our shared Zongolese roots to facilitate the reintegration of Tanaigha and Melahaka as provinces under Zongo."
 zoo_south_2_1:0 "Invest Into Ambutar Arms Factory"
 zoo_south_2_1_desc:0 "TODO"
 zoo_south_2_2:0 "Utilize Melahakan Trade-Ports"
 zoo_south_2_2_desc:0 "The Melahakan ports are far better positioned for southern trade than Zamu. We can leverage this to attract more merchant traffic and secure new deals, furthering our industrialisation."
 zoo_south_3_1:0 "The Tanaighan Steelyards"
 zoo_south_3_1_desc:0 "The region of Tanaigha is very rich in steel, however there seem to be deeper mines that the tribes had no method of extracting. With modern tools now being employed, we may better exploit these abundant resources."
 zoo_south_3_2:0 "Promote Pan-Zongolese Officers"
 zoo_south_3_2_desc:0 "As the south is further connected to the rest of Zongo, many begin to rediscover their ties to our shared Zongolese heritage, choosing to join the army to protect this old homeland they are learning to be proud of again."
 zoo_south_3_3:0 "New Zesalampy Rubber Facility"
 zoo_south_3_3_desc:0 "The island of Zesalampy is very rich in rubber, however it is not yet extracted to its full potential. With modern tools now being employed, we may better exploit these abundant resources." 
 zoo_south_4_1:0 "Repurpose the School of Tanaigha"
 zoo_south_4_1_desc:0 "While the school of Tanaigha currently serves as a simple learning place for basic teachings, its positioning in the south lends itself for us to better expand our education to be better spread in Zongo. We'll repurpose the school to be our newest university, with some new courses focused on avionics and aerodynamics."
 zoo_south_4_2:0 "Restore the Naval School Of Zaredlindi"
 zoo_south_4_2_desc:0 "While long abandoned ever since Zongo was forced to leave the region, the school is in surprisingly good condition. We will do some minor restorations and soon its doors will once again be open for aspiring zebras of the sea."
 zoo_south_5_1:0 "Zongo's Expanded Southern Program"
 zoo_south_5_1_desc:0 "With the south having reached the end of the first phase of the program, we should set up regional facilities to better utilize its specialties and expand our development plans. Be it through the sea or through the airs, the south has given us a way to reach our hooves into the future."
 zoo_south_5_1_tt:0 "The facility that will be constructed depends upon which university we invested in." 

 ##Western tree
 zoo_west_1_1:0 "Legacy of the Zebluan War"
 zoo_west_1_1_desc:0 "After so much loss, Akida has finally avenged the death of his father and gotten their rightful claims on Ithebra and Mzinga back... however, this war ended with much more than that. Now in control of most of the Southeast, Akida must decide whatever shall be done with these lands."
 zoo_west_2_1:0 "The Roaman City-States"
 zoo_west_2_1_desc:0 "TODO"
 zoo_west_2_2:0 "The Houses of Imba-Zaru"
 zoo_west_2_2_desc:0 "Historically home to 6 prevalent houses ever since their monarch died some hundreds of years ago, we must decide how to deal with this unusual system and ensure stability reigns once again in the region."
 zoo_west_3_1:0 "A Future For Ex-Slaves"
 zoo_west_3_1_desc:0 "The slaves under Tzhimane did their best to free themselves from oppression, that is a just cause, even if their methods were extreme. With Zongo being free from slavery, we will show these creatures that they can now rest, a free future awaits them."
 zoo_west_3_2:0 "Divide and Conquer"
 zoo_west_3_2_desc:0 "It is surprising that Zeblu survived as long as it did, being a union of many unruly tribes that take every opportunity to quarrel amongst themselves, only ever being united by strong figures to lead them towards one unified goal. Now, with no Khan at the top, exploiting these rifts will be an easy way to ensure Zeblu remains disunited, now and forever."
 zoo_west_3_3:0 "Mismanagement of Hyena Proportions"
 zoo_west_3_3_desc:0 "The Hyenas of Twizanyika were... not the greatest at their job. Their bureaucracy is a mess, plagued by piracy, plantation owners, and slaves; it's a miracle it functioned as long as it did. We could try salvaging it, but maybe it's best to just bring the whole thing down."
 zoo_west_4_1:0 "The Roaman-Zongolese Citizenry"
 zoo_west_4_1_desc:0 "TODO"
 zoo_west_4_2:0 "Imba-Zaru's Future With Zongo"
 zoo_west_4_2_desc:0 "Imba-Zaru's house system is quickly adapting to their new circumstances, not that dissimilar than our own chieftain system. It seems the creatures there may accept Zongo as their new home faster than expected." 
 zoo_west_5_1:0 "Dealing With The Mercenaries"
 zoo_west_5_1_desc:0 "The wars of Chisimbi attracted many foreigners to the region, none of them do-gooders. Mercenaries, mostly in the employ of the slaving Mavelas, are now stranded with no home. We could just put them in boats and send them away to be someone else's problem... or we could give them jobs to ensure their talents aren't used against us."
 zoo_west_5_2:0 "Learn From The Zebluan Tribes"
 zoo_west_5_2_desc:0 "For all we can criticize from our old enemies, calling their armies weak is not one of those things. Known for their speed in the battlefield trampling all who stood against them, it seems the Zebluan can prove themselves useful by teaching us the tactics that once beat us in the battlefield."
 zoo_west_5_3:0 "The Former Pirates Of Zongo"
 zoo_west_5_3_desc:0 "TODO"
 zoo_west_6_1:0 "Utilize Roam's Merchants"
 zoo_west_6_1_desc:0 "TODO"
 zoo_west_6_2:0 "The Griffon Quarter's Offer"
 zoo_west_6_2_desc:0 "South Chisimbi has been home to a unique phenomenon for three hundred years: a Griffon population known as Kompels. Their architecture is phenomenal; with their construction skills, we can ensure the foundations of our newest structures are sound."
 zoo_west_7_1:0 "A New Legacy In Zongo"
 zoo_west_7_1_desc:0 "The regions of Tzhimane have been scarred by slavery, plutocrats, and war, but their inhabitants may yet find hope under Zongo. With all slaves unchained and any remnants of the Mavelas taking their place in chains, North Chisimbi finds itself with something it may have never expected: Freedom."
 zoo_west_7_2:0 "The Zebluan Grainbasket"
 zoo_west_7_2_desc:0 "The fertile Zebluan plains have long served as a steady supply of grain to keep their war efforts going for as long as they needed. We may now exploit that to feed a whole nation, It's unlikely their khan expected their lands to be serving as a grainbasket for their oldest enemy. The departed king must be laughing from the grave."
 zoo_west_7_3:0 "The Hyenas Of Zongo"
 zoo_west_7_3_desc:0 "While they did enslave much of the local population, it does not mean all Hyenas were slavers. Those that have left those practices behind may now join under a rightful banner: the banner of progress!"
 zoo_west_8_1:0 "Invest In Chromium"
 zoo_west_8_1_desc:0 "TODO"
 zoo_west_8_2:0 "Crystals Are The Future"
 zoo_west_8_2_desc:0 "TODO"
 zoo_west_9_1:0 "Utilize Tzhimane's University"
 zoo_west_9_1_desc:0 "The Mavelas were scum, but it cannot be denied that the Tzhimane university is one of the best in the region, perhaps even rivaling the university where our king studied. Of course, it previously served to perpetuate a cycle of pain by aggrandizing their richest and allowing them the base to keep in power. Now, their university will serve to educate all, even those slaves that were once kept there." 

 ##Army tree
 zoo_army_1_1:0 "Revival of the Royal Guard"
 zoo_army_1_1_desc:0 "Our Royal Guard has stood proudly as defenders of Zongo, but there are still scars from the Zebluan war permeating through their ranks. We shall begin further recruitment to once again fill the ranks of our Royal Guard."
 zoo_army_2_1:0 "Modern Infantry Corps"
 zoo_army_2_1_desc:0 "As he studied in Senturya, Akida got to see the armed forces of today, marching proudly with firearms at their sides. While our army is proud too, it is apparent how behind the times it is. We shall put our efforts into modernising our technologies and doctrines to better fit with modern warfare."
 zoo_army_2_2:0 "New Officers, New Purpose"
 zoo_army_2_2_desc:0 "Traditionally marked by Chieftains leading our armies, they are proud and brash, leading to brash decisions unfit for the modern battlefield. No, the officers of today are not chosen from birth, they shall be chosen by their merit to lead troops and protect our home."
 zoo_army_3_1:0 "Reassert Authority Over Tanaigha"
 zoo_army_3_1_desc:0 "We have retaken the lands of the Tanaigha and have begun to reintegrate the lands into our kingdom. Their tribes may be weary as of now, but they will learn to see themselves as Zongolese again soon enough."
 zoo_army_3_2:0 "Reunite The Zongo Basin"
 zoo_army_3_2_desc:0 "The Zongo Basin has historically been integrated into our kingdom. However, two centuries ago, the southern lands took advantage of an unstable time and repudiated our rule to break away. This cannot stand. With our armies in a better shape than before, we will march and regain our rightful control over the Basin."
 zoo_army_3_3:0 "Repudiate The Melahakan Secession"
 zoo_army_3_3_desc:0 "We have retaken the lands of the Melahaka and have begun to reintegrate the lands into our kingdom. Due to their proximity with Sambovato, they have sturdy ports for trade, resources to tap and some interesting technologies acquired from foreign trade. This is a perfect base from which to project influence over the Peaceful Seas and the Great Horn."
 zoo_army_4_1:0 "Study Tanaigha's Planes"
 zoo_army_4_1_desc:0 "Tanaigha had utilised planes during the war to great effectiveness. We should study the surviving aircraft as examples to further Zongo's armed forces. We will not be limited to ruling the land, but also the skies in due time!" 
 zoo_army_4_2:0 "Expand Modernization Program South"
 zoo_army_4_2_desc:0 "As our territory has expanded to once again encompass the Zongo Basin, it is natural that our industrialisation efforts will follow, bringing these regions up to stand side by side with all of Zongo."
 zoo_army_4_3:0 "Adopt Elite Charger Units"
 zoo_army_4_3_desc:0 "The warriors of Melahaka may have lost the war, but we would be fools to ignore the prowess they showed on the battlefield. We shall integrate the proud Chargers of Melahaka into our Royal Guard."
 zoo_army_5_1:0 "Plan For Zebra Unification"
 zoo_army_5_1_desc:0 "Our Pan-Zongolese ambitions are fulfilled, but we will never be secure while Chisimbi remains, their leaders viewing our lands as just another target. We must prepare for inevitable conflict with them, but if we'll be fighting anyways, perhaps a Pan-Zebra outlook could allow us to better deal with the region and even integrate them into our industrialisation effors."
 zoo_army_5_2:0 "Treatise With Sambovato"
 zoo_army_5_2_desc:0 "The small island state of Sambovato has long been a hub for regional trade. With their lack of mainland interests, perhaps we could formulate a treaty for both our countries to stand together, allowing us to tap their potential and assist with their industrialisation, in exchange for us to formally stand together as allies."
 zoo_army_6_1:0 "Assess Zaikirian Options"
 zoo_army_6_1_desc:0 "Zaikiria has long been a bag of problems, with the Lan-Kir occasionally raiding us and the Matriarchs of Kiria keeping a greedy eye on the region. We must focus our attention there and decide on a course of action."
 zoo_army_6_2:0 "An Army To Be Proud Of"
 zoo_army_6_2_desc:0 ""
 zoo_army_6_3:0 "Secure The Eastern Peninsula"
 zoo_army_6_3_desc:0 "The Zebridea region has long been isolated from the rest of the Southeast, with their sprawling jungles and alien fauna, all past attempts to gain influence there were short-lived. Today, as Zongo stands modernised and strong, perhaps it is finally time to swiftly end these tribal states and bring the Lost Jungle to modernity."

 ##Eastern tree #May change up later
 zoo_east_1_1:0 "Naval Authority Over Manelilipol"
 zoo_east_1_1_desc:0 "Some of the southernmost reaches of the southeast can be found in the lands of the Maglibing. Surrounded by mountains, the small settlement of Manelilipol shall serve as the foundation for our fleet to rest and expand their influence in the southernmost reaches of Zebrica."
 zoo_east_1_2:0 "Expand The Cape's Garrisons"

 zongo.1.desc:0 "The Ceremony Hall at the University of İlkşehir was packed.  It was filled to the brim with centaurs, zebras, and a myriad of other creatures alike. To him, it almost looked like a dress rehearsal for his coronation. He smiled at the thought. Years of study and work had brought him to this moment. Soon, very soon, he would finally put all that learning to good use.\n\n"And for our next recipient," his ears twitched as the Rector began to speak from the stage, "I humbly introduce one of our top students. He who has worked tirelessly for this distinction, and elevated our prestige tenfold: Crown-Prince Akida Bomboko!" At the cue, Akida walked onto the stage with his head held high as the applause washed over him. He stopped in front of the Rector, an aged centaur who looked down at him with pride.\n\n"Prince Bomboko. Your treatise in the employment of railways to allow for rapid modernization has not gone unnoticed. You have not only enriched this institution, but the sphere of economic theory as a whole. So," the centaur moved a hand to the podium, where he grasped on to a small, round pin emblazoned with the horned emblem of the university. "It is with great honor that I now grant you the title of Doctor.” He bent down, and the pin was clipped onto the lapel of Akida's suit. "Now, if you would like to say a few words?"\n\nAkida couldn't help himself from grinning. "Why, I would!" he said with a chuckle as he climbed a few steps up to the podium. A sea of faces stretched out before him. "To say that I am immensely honored to receive this distinction would be an understatement. İlkşehir has been nothing but kind to me, and has taught me so much more than I ever thought there was to learn. I will not forget this, and neither will Zongo. I thank you all who have helped me on this journey. Because of you all-""

 zongo.2.desc:0 "The sun set on the cafe. Akida watched the sky turn to red as he fully understood the magnitude of going home. Home. Where he had not set hoof since his father's death. Where his mother ruled in his stead. He was practically a colt when he left, barely able to grapple with his grief. He would return a stallion now. For the first time he began to feel anxious anticipation in how he would be received after so long.\n\n"That frown doesn't suit you very well." Akida took his eyes off the sky and to the zebra in front of him, who smirked back. Zyles was a brilliant stallion who hailed from the other side of the continent. They had been steadfast friends for years. His heart panged. The prince smiled, "I am simply practicing my noble disposition."\n\n"Sure, if looking as if you've just eaten a lemon counts," Zyles picked at his half-finished food, "but I have a feeling His Highness isn't telling me the whole truth."\n\nAkida sighed. "I suppose I am realizing just how much of my life I have spent here. I have walked these streets so long, and made so many memories here, that leaving feels as if I'm leaving home all over again." He smiled sheepishly, "Sounds rather foalish now that I say it out loud, doesn't it?"\n\n"Not at all, friend. I know I'll miss you." Zyles paused in thought, before tapping his hoof on the table. He bent down to his bag, where he took out a small book. "My latest has just been released- fresh off the presses as it were. Take this as a going-away gift. So you don't forget me," he winked, "I wouldn't mind you passing my name around when you've taken the throne, either."\n\nHis face lit up in joy, before smiling softly. "I-I don't know what to say, I'm touched." Akida looked down at the book, and read the title printed in large, glossy letters:"

 zongo.3.t:0 "Packing For Home" #SIREN
 zongo.3.desc:0 "Akida's side of the room was empty. Gone were the newspaper clippings and mouth-drawn designs, the books stacked up high like towers, and walls plastered with his personal mementos and gifts from home. Now only a single steamer trunk lying on the floor indicated that he had ever been there at all. Years of his life at the University was piled away, just like that. The road to his brighter future was packed light. Akida slipped on the trunk's harness and made his way for the door. Then, he stopped as he made one last look over. His eyes landed on his roommate's side of the dorm, still full, and onto a blueprint.\n\nIt was a study of an already existing firearm design, one that had once been very popular in the region. Akida remembered the centaur youth talking his ear off about this particular project months ago, and how it was meant to test the designer's fundamentals. He studied the precise lines and clear labels. His own kingdom had little- for now- in the way of a manufacturing base for such things. If there were any firearms within its borders, they certainly weren't Zongolese. With that, an idea began to dawn on him. He would have to bring in specialists into the kingdom as soon as he could. But with these designs, he could lay the groundwork for production as soon as he arrived!\n\nSoon, there was a written note with a hefty bag of coins to weigh it down. Akida set out once more, sliding the folded blueprints into coat as his mind raced with all the things that would come."

 zongo.4.t:0 "The Arrival" #SIREN
 zongo.4.desc:0 "Akida felt his breath hitch as the ship moored to the port of Zamu. League and leagues of low-lying houses expanded outwards, painting the horizon white and gray and brown. As far as he could see every inch of the city teemed with equinity, bright and bustling. Soon, those closest turned their heads to him as the ship properly docked. The prince was finally home.\n\nHe rushed to the gangway, waving as the chatter of the crowd grew. There at the docks was a procession of soldiers. With them, he finally saw her. A finely dressed middle-aged zebra mare. She was in the process of severely dressing down a commander, it seemed. Akida smiled, and he practically pranced on the way down. "Mother!" he called out, "I don't suppose yelling at this poor stallion is part of the welcoming ceremony?"\n\nHer voice cut out abruptly. Her face, twisted in a mean snarl, went blank. "Akida?" she asked. Before he could respond, she galloped forward and crushed him in a hug. "You are finally here, my foal!" When she pulled back, she looked at him with nothing but pure affection. "Never mind all that; how was the trip back? You don't feel sick, do you? Because I swear if you do-" she fussed. He cut her off, "I promise you, I'm perfectly alright. Enough so to make the way back to the palace, at least."\n\nHis mother nodded. "Of course, of course. We better get a move on, then. You!" She sharply turned to the commander behind her and snapped, "What are you doing, dawdling about- do you expect your future king to carry his own luggage? Move!" There was an explosion of movement then. Without turning back, his mother trotted ahead of him. She looked over her shoulder with a smile, "Come along, Akida. You have a lot to catch up on.""

He just needed a moment to collect himself before crossing that final threshold.\n\nIIt was one thing to dream of wielding his father’s power. It was another to step into the nitty-gritty of governance. In the room beyond, his council had finally gathered, each with their own agendas, beliefs and loyalties that extended beyond the throne. His dreams of a modern Zongo would have to endure them all. He licked his dry lips, suddenly nervous. Inside, he could hear they were already arguing. It was like hearing the first crash of thunder from an approaching storm.\n\nBut as all as storms do, it passed. When he strode into the room, he looked each one of them in the eye, their bickering ending as all bowed in his honor. These would be the creatures he would deal with for his entire reign: advisors from every walk of life, all seated and waiting for their soon-to-be king. His mother sat beside his chair, an ever-present smile on her face.\n\nWith a final, deep breath, he opened his mouth to address the room."

 zongo.7.t:0 "A Talk with Mother" #SIREN
 zongo.7.desc:0 "The last time Akida had tea with his mother was in Senturya. Officially, it was for a diplomatic visit. Really though, she just used it as an excuse to see him. Even just a year ago their conversation had been light, and he couldn't recall what subjects they discussed. Now, the atmosphere couldn't have been more different. For the first time, they didn't speak as just kin, but as monarchs.\n\n"Zongo has thrived under you," Akida admitted, "but I look around and the kingdom looks exactly as it did the day I left. Truthfully, it has been the same since Father's rule." He smiled lightly, his expression turning to quiet determination. "I believe there needs to be change. Only a great shake-up will wake our kingdom from its stupor. We have the means to completely transform Zongo into something of envy. This cannot be done without your help. I have my vision, but you have the experience and expertise I do not. So..." the prince shifted in his seat, "would you help me?"\n\nHis mother took a long sip of her tea. Her gaze pierced through him. From the outsider's perspective, he could see why so many found her intimidating. Long past her golden years as she was, she still carried herself with an air of power and dignity that was impossible to ignore. "I can't say I'm enthused," she sighed, "pretty as it is, your 'vision' of change is sure to bring nothing but trouble. I have run this kingdom the way I have for a reason." Her sharp tone made the prince frown, but she kept on. "But, you are king. Your word is all, and not even I am exempt from it. You have my counsel, and I will do everything in my power to ensure that Zongo prospers as we want it to." She smiled sweetly at Akida, "Rest assured, my son, I will be there for you every step of the way.""

Akida's attire was intricate, his golden earrings and colorful clothing a show of Zongo's wealth. As he walked towards the throne, a single mare awaited him beside it.\n\n"It is good to have you here for this, Mother." Akida gave a small bow to his mother. She smiled proudly at her son, her outfit nearly as intricate as his. "I guess this means I'm not a little colt anymore."\n\nHer smile seemed to falter, emotion giving way in her face. "Oh, my little Akida... you are as beautiful as your father! How could you have grown so fast..." She quickly composed herself. "I should not keep you waiting any longer. Do you, Akida Bomboko, promise to be fair and respectful to all your subjects? To honor your ancestors and your duty? To understand how as of today, you live not only for yourself, but as the representative to all of Zongo?"\n\n"I do," he answered in quick succession to each question.\n\n"Very well then. As acting regent, I lay down my position and give way..." As if on command, he lowered his head, his heart pounding with anticipation. "...Mwenezongo, King of the Zongolese!" As the crown landed on his head, cheers began to fill the grand hall as every creature erupted in joy. The Queen-Mother had a proud but composed smile. "Long live Zongo! Long live our King! Long live my son!" With cheers growing ever louder, his mother began to guide him out of the hall.\n\nAs they walked outside, a clear path was laid down the middle of the road where an adorned carriage waited. Thousands of zebras lined the sides, all instantly erupting into cheers as he walked out. His heart beat faster than ever before... Was this the feeling of being a king? Of having so many relying upon you? As the crowd cheered, he could only think of their smiling faces as his plan went forward. He had to get it done, not only for himself, but– His mother tugged on him, quietly whispering in his ear. "Remember, try not to break too many hearts at the ceremony, you're too young to be having an heir." As he blushed and they both laughed, Akida felt as a colt for one last time. From then on, he was King."
 zongo.8.desc_normal:0 "As he was at the grand hall, zebras all around kept a quiet veneer of respect. Akida's attire was the same his father had used in his coronation, a show of respect to those who had come before. As he walked towards the throne, a single mare awaited him beside it.\n\n"It is good to meet you once again, Head Priestess." Akida gave a small bow to the mare. She had a whole different aura to herself at this moment, her kind smiles and laughs of before gone. Akida did not feel offended; it was a momentous occasion not only for him but for her as well, standing before the kingdom's most important creatures. Akida gave her a smile. "Do not tell anyone, but I'm also a little anxious."\n\nAs if a weight had been lifted off her back, the priestess gave a small smile, unnoticeable to those far away. Mustering her courage, she began to speak. "Do you, Akida Bomboko, promise to be fair and respectful to all your subjects? To honor your ancestors and your duty? To understand how as of today, you live not only for yourself, but as the representative to all of Zongo?"\n\n"I do," he answered in quick succession to each question.\n\n"Very well then. As Head-Priestess, I now proclaim you..." As if on command, he lowered his head, his heart pounding with anticipation. "...Mwenezongo, King of the Zongolese!" As the crown landed on his head, cheers began to fill the grand hall, as every single creature erupted into cheers of joy for their new king. The Queen-Mother in the distance had a proud but composed smile, akin to the one on the Head Priestess's face.\n\nAkida walked outside as if still in a daze, only to be met by thousands of zebras, all instantly erupting into cheers once they noticed the adornment on his head. "His heart beat faster than ever before... Was this the feeling of being a king? Of having so many relying upon you?" As the crowd cheered, he could only think of their smiling faces as his plan went forward. He had to get it done, not only for himself, but for all of his subjects."

 zongo.9.desc:0 "Akida stood a bit unenthused, his mother serving as a clear contrast to his tired face as she looked through a book of items, showcasing them to the young king.\n\n"Look here, my son! Wouldn't these golden earrings look perfect upon your pretty little face at your coronation?" She made motion as if to pinch his cheeks, but refrained from doing so. "Of course, there's also the matter of the venue... it would bring shame to your late father and yourself if you were to reserve a post-party venue that did not bring out your best traits. Ah!" She looked startled, as she flipped through the book. "Of course we can't forget we need more foreign dancers, they are sure to attract the attention of both noble and peasant alike during the ceremony. Do you prefer Senturyan or perhaps something more exotic? I hear Kirian bladedancers are a beauty to behold. The centaurs make for flimsy dancers in my opinion, but considering how you've spent the last few years alongside their kind, maybe it would create a better atmosphere... what do you think?"\n\nAkida seemed as if his head would blow, taking a moment to breathe as his mother finally stopped her onslaught of suggestions and questions. "Dear mother... I have been trying to say that I wish for none of that. A standard coronation will suffice." His mother kept the same smiling face, changed only by the occasional blink, finally speaking up after a long silence.\n\n"Standard...?" His mother's smile finally faltered for a second. "My son, these are the standard expectations... I have been as frugal as I could! Any cheaper than this and they'll surely call you foul names on the streets such as the "Poor King" or the "Frugal King", I cannot allow them to besmirch my dearest son! Now, be a dear and choose a dancer." As quickly as it had left, her smile had come back, leaving Akida with little choice.\n\nHe couldn't help but think how much this would end up costing from the already very tight budget he had inherited to get his plans started. His mother did have a point. A lavish ceremony was the traditional way to project the power of the Zongolese monarchs, which would surely satisfy and quiet everyone... but something within him kept bugging him about all those wasted funds. Was tradition really that important to the march of progress? With his mothers smile still intact, Akida spoke up."

 zongo.10.desc:0 "Akida was thrilled to embark on the first steps of his grand plan, a vision for the Kingdom of Zongo based on his years of study at Senturya. The kingdom was a treasure trove of potential, and he knew it. He immediately rose to address the delegates and chiefs, the enactors of his will, gathered in the council chamber to hear their role in shaping the kingdom's future. \n\n"Zebras of Zongo, today marks the first step in a long journey to prosperity. As everyone knows, our nation is wealthy beyond comparison, yet our citizens live in huts and toil away with simple sticks and stones. No longer! With the help of specialists from abroad, I have devised a grand plan for the rapid modernization of Zongo." Akida stated confidently, laying out a map of his proposed rail network for the kingdom. \n\n"I have seen how far other nations have gone, literally and figuratively, when a creature can go from one province to the next in hours, not days, where villages can exchange their precious stones for food and furniture with relative ease, where Zongo's great industry can thrive with the wealth of our land. After all, what use is a fruit or treasure if one cannot reach it?" \n\nThere was some slight hesitation as the council looked at each other before their attention turned to Nzuzi's short cough. They soon found themselves staring deep into her cold gaze, falling in line and stomping their hooves to approve King Akida's plan."

When the chieftain and priest leave talking to each other, they're discussing how the king is still young and how he can still be 'guided', manipulated.

The prognosis was not grim, but it was also not promising.\n\nThe King had called for a break for lunch, and his closest advisors had joined him on a balcony overlooking the capitol. They’d talked, and eaten, and then talked again. The conversation spiraled into arguments over and over.\n\n“I just don’t see a way to balance our priorities here without compromising one of them,” Anarbek said at last. “It’s the old problem of nation-building. Guns or bread.”\n\n“One of those seems more important,” Ayana said flatly. Dikembe snorted.\n\n“We do not need the King to send his officers door to door making sure every foal has the right amount of bread,” he groused. “The world is dangerous, and we are weak. We need modern weapons. We’ve survived for a thousand years without the royal dole.”\n\n“And in the intervening years, the population of Zongo has exploded,” Anarbek cut in, breaking hs reverie. “A strong nation needs strong foundations, Councillor Dikembe. Look to Equestria’s example, in the early Solarian Reforms! The—”\n\nThe noblezebra cut him off with a growl. “I do not want to be lectured, centaur. Equestria, Griffons, Centaurs, whoever! This is Zongo. And Zongo does not need someone else’s answer.” He looked suddenly, pointedly to the king, who was still weighing the numbers in his mind as he stared down at his plate. “And only one zebra can give us Zongo’s answer.”"

To his surprise, unlike the old matriarch he remembers from the time of his father a young Priestess enters the council chamber. In his surprise he asks who she is. She goes on to explain that 2 years ago right before the former head-priestess died. She had had a vision that the church needed new blood as leadership and who better than her assistant. The council of priests decided to honour her wish under both the belief that it was a divine intervention and pressure from the Queen-mother who favoured a young, manipulable headpriestess over a political veteran. They get along very well (they're both roughly the same age, 22-23ish)"

 #Railway events
 #All of these can be relatively shorter events. They show the increasing impact of the modernization program and its benefits, while hiding a tint of the ever-increasing poverty brought along with rapid industrialization. Corruption is not really an issue, and the monarchy in whoms name the modernization program is being done has sole and absolute authority to enact. This is not a democratic state making these grand plans possible. It should be written from the pov of a successful enlightened despotist industrialization program, well thought out, technocratically based.

The priestess sees a righteous person in him, she gets along really well (despite what she knows to be the effects of the program on the populace and the poverty/inequality it brings. She is like all of the court well aware about what the queen-mother is hiding from him but no one dares tell lest they want to find an assassin in their house while sleeping.)

The king shyly dodges the question as to when he intends to wed, they look at each other when suddenly they are snapped back to reality by the sound of someone falling.

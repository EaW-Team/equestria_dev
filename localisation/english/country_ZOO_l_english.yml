The local populace, while resourceful and resilient, lacks access to modern education and healthcare, which impedes the kingdom's overall development.

 zongo.1.t:0 "The Confirmation" #SIREN
 zongo.1.desc:0 "The Ceremony Hall at the University of İlkşehir was packed.  It was filled to the brim with centaurs, zebras, and a myriad of other creatures alike. To him, it almost looked like a dress rehearsal for his coronation. He smiled at the thought. Years of study and work had brought him to this moment. Soon, very soon, he would finally put all that learning to good use.\n\n"And for our next recipient," his ears twitched as the Rector began to speak from the stage, "I humbly introduce one of our top students. He who has worked tirelessly for this distinction, and elevated our prestige tenfold: Crown-Prince Akida Bomboko!" At the cue, Akida walked onto the stage with his head held high as the applause washed over him. He stopped in front of the Rector, an aged centaur who looked down at him with pride.\n\n"Prince Bomboko. Your treatise in the employment of railways to allow for rapid modernization has not gone unnoticed. You have not only enriched this institution, but the sphere of economic theory as a whole. So," the centaur moved a hand to the podium, where he grasped on to a small, round pin emblazoned with the horned emblem of the university. "It is with great honor that I now grant you the title of Doctor.” He bent down, and the pin was clipped onto the lapel of Akida's suit. "Now, if you would like to say a few words?"\n\nAkida couldn't help himself from grinning. "Why, I would!" he said with a chuckle as he climbed a few steps up to the podium. A sea of faces stretched out before him. "To say that I am immensely honored to receive this distinction would be an understatement. İlkşehir has been nothing but kind to me, and has taught me so much more than I ever thought there was to learn. I will not forget this, and neither will Zongo. I thank you all who have helped me on this journey. Because of you all-""

 zongo.2.t:0 "Saying Goodbye" #SIREN
 zongo.2.desc:0 "The sun set on the cafe. Akida watched the sky turn to red as he fully understood the magnitude of going home. Home. Where he had not set hoof since his father's death. Where his mother ruled in his stead. He was practically a colt when he left, barely able to grapple with his grief. He would return a stallion now. For the first time he began to feel anxious anticipation in how he would be received after so long.\n\n"That frown doesn't suit you very well." Akida took his eyes off the sky and to the zebra in front of him, who smirked back. Zyles was a brilliant stallion who hailed from the other side of the continent. They had been steadfast friends for years. His heart panged. The prince smiled, "I am simply practicing my noble disposition."\n\n"Sure, if looking as if you've just eaten a lemon counts," Zyles picked at his half-finished food, "but I have a feeling His Highness isn't telling me the whole truth."\n\nAkida sighed. "I suppose I am realizing just how much of my life I have spent here. I have walked these streets so long, and made so many memories here, that leaving feels as if I'm leaving home all over again." He smiled sheepishly, "Sounds rather foalish now that I say it out loud, doesn't it?"\n\n"Not at all, friend. I know I'll miss you." Zyles paused in taught, before tapping his hoof on the table. He bent down to his bag, where he took out a small book. "My latest has just been released- fresh off the presses as it were. Take this as a going-away gift. So you don't forget me," he winked, "I wouldn't mind you passing my name around when you've taken the throne, either."\n\nHis face lit up in joy, before smiling softly. "I-I don't know what to say, I'm touched." Akida looked down at the book, and read the title printed in large, glossy letters:"

Gone were the newspaper clippings and mouth-drawn designs, the books stacked up high like towers, and walls plastered with his personal mementos and gifts from home. Now only a single steamer trunk lying on the floor indicated that he had ever been there at all. Years of his life at the University was piled away, just like that. The road to his brighter future was packed light. Akida slipped on the trunk's harness and made his way for the door. Then, he stopped as he made one last look over. His eyes landed on his roommate's side of the dorm, still full, and onto a blueprint.\n\nIt was a study of an already existing firearm design, one that had once been very popular in the region. Akida remembered the centaur youth talking his ear off about this particular project months ago, and how it was meant to test the designer's fundamentals. He studied the precise lines and clear labels. His own kingdom had little- for now- in the way of a manufacturing base for such things. If there were any firearms within its borders, they certainly weren't Zongolese. With that, an idea began to dawn on him. He would have to bring in specialists into the kingdom as soon as he could. But with these designs, he could lay the groundwork for production as soon as he arrived!\n\nSoon, there was a written note with a hefty bag of coins to weigh it down. Akida set out once more, sliding the folded blueprints into coat as his mind raced with all the things that would come." 
 zongo.3.a:0 "The note read: "Borrowed some designs. I hope you will not mind?""
 
 zongo.4.t:0 "The Arrival" #SIREN
 zongo.4.desc:0 "Akida felt his breath hitch as the ship moored to the port of Zamu. League and leagues of low-lying houses expanded outwards, painting the horizon white and gray and brown. As far as he could see every inch of the city teemed with equinity, bright and bustling. Soon, those closest turned their heads to him as the ship properly docked. The prince was finally home.\n\nHe rushed to the gangway, waving as the chatter of the crowd grew. There at the docks was a procession of soldiers. With them, he finally saw her. A finely dressed middle-aged zebra mare. She was in the process of severely dressing down a commander, it seemed. Akida smiled, and he practically pranced on the way down. "Mother!" he called out, "I don't suppose yelling at this poor stallion is part of the welcoming ceremony?"\n\nHer voice cut out abruptly. Her face, twisted in a mean snarl, went blank. "Akida?" she asked. Before he could respond, she galloped forward and crushed him in a hug. "You are finally here, my foal!" When she pulled back, she looked at him with nothing but pure affection. "Never mind all that; how was the trip back? You don't feel sick, do you? Because I swear if you do-" she fussed. He cut her off, "I promise you, I'm perfectly alright. Enough so to make the way back to the palace, at least."\n\nHis mother nodded. "Of course, of course. We better get a move on, then. You!" She sharply turned to the commander behind her and snapped, "What are you doing, dawdling about- do you expect your future king to carry his own luggage? Move!" There was an explosion of movement then. Without turning back, his mother trotted ahead of him. She looked over her shoulder with a smile, "Come along, Akida. You have a lot to catch up on.""

 zongo.5.t:0 "Gathering the Council" 
 zongo.5.desc:0 "King Akida stood before the great door, ignoring the confused looks of his royal guards. He just needed a moment to collect himself before passing over that last threshold.\n\nIt was one thing to dream of what he would do, given his father’s power. It was a very different thing to be stepping into the actual nitty-gritty of governance. In the room beyond, his council had finally gathered, each with their own agendas, beliefs, loyalties beyond their fealty to the throne.His dreams of a modern Zongo would have to endure them all. He licked his dry lips, suddenly nervous. Inside, he could hear them arguing, bickering. It was like a hearing the first crash of thunder from an approaching storm.\n\nBut it passed. When he strode into the room, he looked each one of them in the eye. His old teacher, beaming with pride. Ayana, the unreadable shaman from the northern tribes known for their advocacy for the common zebra. Dikembe, a stern faced aristocrat chosen by his peers to assert their ancient privileges. The past, the present, and the future, all in one room."

This should set him up as not the most social type but it's not like he's socially incapable, just not interested. One of the chieftains should ask him what he plans to do as king, he hints at the modernization plan. Mother watches him the whole time"

 zongo.7.t:0 "A Talk with Mother" #SIREN
 zongo.7.desc:0 "The last time Akida had tea with his mother was in Senturya. Officially, it was for a diplomatic visit. Really though, she just used it as an excuse to see him. Even just a year ago their conversation had been light, and he couldn't recall what subjects they discussed. Now, the atmosphere couldn't have been more different. For the first time, they didn't speak as just kin, but as monarchs.\n\n"Zongo has thrived under you," Akida admitted, "but I look around and the kingdom looks exactly as it did the day I left. Truthfully, it has been the same since Father's rule." He smiled lightly, his expression turning to quiet determination. "I believe there needs to be change. Only a great shake-up will wake our kingdom from its stupor. We have the means to completely transform Zongo into something of envy. This cannot be done without your help. I have my vision, but you have the experience and expertise I do not. So..." the prince shifted in his seat, "would you help me?"\n\nHis mother took a long sip of her tea. Her gaze pierced through him. From the outsider's perspective, he could see why so many found her intimidating. Long past her golden years as she was, she still carried herself with an air of power and dignity that was impossible to ignore. "I can't say I'm enthused," she sighed, "pretty as it is, your 'vision' of change is sure to bring nothing but trouble. I have run this kingdom the way I have for a reason." Her sharp tone made the prince frown, but she kept on. "But, you are king. Your word is all, and not even I am exempt from it. You have my counsel, and I will do everything in my power to ensure that Zongo prospers as we want it to." She smiled sweetly at Akida, "Rest assured, my son, I will be there for you every step of the way.""

 zongo.10.desc:0 "Akida was thrilled to embark on the first steps of his grand plan, a vision for the Kingdom of Zongo based on his years of study at Senturya. The kingdom was a treasure trove of potential, and he knew it. He immediately rose to address the delegates and chiefs, the enactors of his will, gathered in the council chamber to hear their role in shaping the kingdom's future. \n\n"Zebras of Zongo, today marks the first step in a long journey to prosperity. As everyone knows, our nation is wealthy beyond comparison, yet our citizens live in huts and toil away with simple sticks and stones. No longer! With the help of specialists from abroad, I have devised a grand plan for the rapid modernization of Zongo." Akida stated confidently, laying out a map of his proposed rail network for the kingdom. \n\n"I have seen how far other nations have gone, literally and figuratively, when a creature can go from one province to the next in hours, not days, where villages can exchange their precious stones for food and furniture with relative ease, where Zongo's great industry can thrive with the wealth of our land. After all, what use is a fruit or treasure if one cannot reach it?" \n\nThere was some slight hesitation as the council looked at each other before their attention turned to Nzuzi's short cough. They soon found themselves staring deep into her cold gaze, falling in line and stomping their hooves to approve King Akida's plan."

The chieftain is not amused but still fearful of royal authority is cautious in arguing against. The priest however urges the prince to remember the plight of the people and to hold onto religious values. When the chieftain and priest leave talking to each other, they're discussing how the king is still young and how he can still be 'guided', manipulated. The mother overhears this and immediately starts ensuring she has spies in their homes incase they ever need to be taken care of if they form a problem (murdered). The chieftain and priest will become an available advisor.  (priests are the communists)"

 zongo.13.desc:0 "Anarbek clicked his tongue. It was a familiar tick, one that came to the fore when the old centaur was lost in thought. Akidu didn’t blame him—the day had been short on answers and long on complicated analysis. The prognosis was not grim, but it was also not promising.\n\nThe King had called for a break for lunch, and his closest advisors had joined him on a balcony overlooking the capitol. They’d talked, and eaten, and then talked again. The conversation spiraled into arguments over and over.\n\n“I just don’t see a way to balance our priorities here without compromising one of them,” Anarbek said at last. “It’s the old problem of nation-building. Guns or bread.”\n\n“One of those seems more important,” Ayana said flatly. Dikembe snorted.\n\n“We do not need the King to send his officers door to door making sure every foal has the right amount of bread,” he groused. “The world is dangerous, and we are weak. We need modern weapons. We’ve survived for a thousand years without the royal dole.”\n\n“And in the intervening years, the population of Zongo has exploded,” Anarbek cut in, breaking hs reverie. “A strong nation needs strong foundations, Councillor Dikembe. Look to Equestria’s example, in the early Solarian Reforms! The—”\n\nThe noblezebra cut him off with a growl. “I do not want to be lectured, centaur. Equestria, Griffons, Centaurs, whoever! This is Zongo. And Zongo does not need someone else’s answer.” He looked suddenly, pointedly to the king, who was still weighing the numbers in his mind as he stared down at his plate. “And only one zebra can give us Zongo’s answer.”"

 zongo.14.desc:0 "Prompt - the prince has a meeting with the new head of the church who is just returning to the capital (she wouldn't have been present in any council meeting yet so he couldn't have met her). To his surprise, unlike the old matriarch he remembers from the time of his father a young Priestess enters the council chamber. In his surprise he asks who she is. She goes on to explain that 2 years ago right before the former head-priestess died. She had had a vision that the church needed new blood as leadership and who better than her assistant. The council of priests decided to honour her wish under both the belief that it was a divine intervention and pressure from the Queen-mother who favoured a young, manipulable headpriestess over a political veteran. They get along very well (they're both roughly the same age, 22-23ish)"

 #Railway events
 #All of these can be relatively shorter events. They show the increasing impact of the modernization program and its benefits, while hiding a tint of the ever-increasing poverty brought along with rapid industrialization. Corruption is not really an issue, and the monarchy in whoms name the modernization program is being done has sole and absolute authority to enact. This is not a democratic state making these grand plans possible. It should be written from the pov of a successful enlightened despotist industrialization program, well thought out, technocratically based.

The priestess sees a righteous person in him, she gets along really well (despite what she knows to be the effects of the program on the populace and the poverty/inequality it brings. She is like all of the court well aware about what the queen-mother is hiding from him but no one dares tell lest they want to find an assassin in their house while sleeping.)

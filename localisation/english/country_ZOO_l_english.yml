 ### Ideas ###
 ZOO_regency_1:0 "Regent-mother's Rule"
 ZOO_regency_1_desc:0 "Under the regent-mother's rule, Zongo has maintained a delicate balance between the old ways and the undercurrents of change. The regency period is marked by cautious governance, characterized by a conservative approach to internal affairs and diplomacy. While this has ensured a stable rule, it has also led to a lack of significant progress and innovation."
 ZOO_regency_2:0 "The Mother's influence"
 ZOO_regency_2_desc:0 "The mother still holds a lot of control behind the screens, shielding the king without his knowledge."

 ZOO_untapped_potential_1:0 "Untapped Potential"
 ZOO_untapped_potential_1_desc:0 "Zongo is a land of untapped riches, both in terms of natural resources and human potential. However, for the last millenia, these resources have remained largely underexploited. The current approach of economic policy has led to an economic stagnation, with traditional tribal agriculture prevailing over modern economic ventures. The local populace, while resourceful and resilient, lacks access to modern education and healthcare, which impedes the kingdom's overall development. As a result, Zongo stands at a crossroads, rich in potential but constrained by a lack of innovation and modern infrastructure to cross the jungles."

 ZOO_grand_railroad_project:0 "Grand Railroad Project"
 ZOO_grand_railroad_project_desc:0 "Every week a tile of railroad will be constructed."

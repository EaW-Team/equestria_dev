 ZOO_queen_mother_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 17th of March, 965 in Ithebra\n\n§YBiography§!: As the youngest daughter to the Mani of Ithebra, Nzuzi always had to fight to get ahead of her peers. The love of her parents had always been just a hoof too far, but it did not mean she would not end up finding it elsewhere. Not long after she reached marrying age, fate led her to meet Nkosi Bomboko during a party. What began as a formality quickly deepened into genuine love. He was captivated by her formidable will and self-starting nature; she, in turn, was drawn to his sweet and caring character, which was balanced by the commanding posture of a true king. Their connection was swift and passionate, with the two standing side by side as husband and wife by the end of the same year.\n\nJust one year later, in 985, Nzuzi was pregnant with what she hoped would be the first of many, naming him Akida. However, the stresses of pregnancy had been too much on the mare and severe complications left her infertile, leaving Akida instead as her only foal. Yet, she was content. She had a loving husband, a son she could dote on and the respect her parents had always refused to give her; she had truly achieved all things she dreamed of as a filly. \n\nUnfortunately, fate would not let her have this happiness for long. In his quest to reform Zongo and retake the province of Ithebra from the Zebluan, her husband was killed. With her son not yet of age, Nzuzi installed herself as Regent and sent Akida abroad for his safety. While he studied, she dedicated herself to finishing the work her husband had begun, securing royal authority and preparing the nation for the societal reforms her son would one day lead. While she is not beloved by the people as her husband had been, she does not mind.\n\nHer only two wishes are to see her son smile and to see her home prosper, and she will stop at nothing to ensure that happens. She anxiously waits for any news of his return so she can finally hug and pamper her little Akida once more.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: kelKessel"

 ### Focuses ###
 ##intro
 zoo_the_homecoming:0 "The Arrival"
 zoo_the_homecoming_desc:0 "Long ago when the kingdom nearly exploded with unrest, Prince Akida was sent away for his own safety... and more importantly, to learn the way of governance in peace. Now, word has arrived of his return to take his rightful place on the throne. With the Prince's so-loved subjects of economics and locomotives taking center stage during his time abroad, a new era for Zongo is sure to unfold."
 zoo_gathering_the_council:0 "Gather The Council"
 zoo_gathering_the_council_desc:0 "Long serving as an advisory body to the kings of Zongo, the Royal Council has found itself powerless at the whims of the monarchy more times than not. With Akida coming to power, his disinterest in politicking has made for good bedmates with the council, finally granting them an opportunity to be more than just a formality."
 zoo_homecoming_celebrations:0 "Celebrate The Homecoming"
 zoo_homecoming_celebrations_desc:0 "Finally, the prince has come back to his homeland, celebrations must ensue! Even if he seems a bit disinterested, the Mother-Queen has ensured this will serve as a good opportunity to get ingratiated with the rest of the country's elite, leaving Akida little choice."
 zoo_send_for_specialists:0 "Send For Specialists"
 zoo_send_for_specialists_desc:0 "Having spent the last few years mingling with the greatest minds of the Ancient Pact, prince Akida has found himself deeply displeased with the intelligentsia of his own homeland. To ensure his future plans proceed without issue, he will summon foreign experts to fill his halls. Of course, they'll be finely recompensed for their work."
 zoo_assure_the_chiefs:0 "Assure The Chiefs"
 zoo_assure_the_chiefs_desc:0 "The last thing Akida wants are chieftains bothering his plans for the nation, even if he dislikes having to talk to so many of them, it's better to make his goals clear now so as to not face problems in the future."
 zoo_talk_to_mother:0 "A Talk With Mother"
 zoo_talk_to_mother_desc:0 "Nzuzi Bomboko. Queen-Regent, mother to the Crown-Prince, and widow to the late king. In Akida's absence it was she who held on to the reigns of power for him to inherit. With his coronation fast approaching, an official meeting on the matters of state between them is all but necessary for a smooth royal transition."
 zoo_prepare_the_coronation:0 "Prepare The Coronation"
 zoo_prepare_the_coronation_desc:0 "With Akida having spent a few weeks in Zongo's shores, preparations for his formal coronation must be readied, all that's left is to see how much will be spent on it." 
 zoo_new_budget:0 "Plan The Budget"
 zoo_new_budget_desc:0 "More important than any of the politicking that has happened until now, prince Akida has called for his economic specialists to gather and ready the budget for the prince's plans. No corners can be cut in his ambition, no matter how many numbers have to be crunched."
 zoo_talk_to_the_church:0 "Meet with the Faith"
 zoo_talk_to_the_church_desc:0 "Out of the many important figures he has had to meet, the last ones for him to meet are the leaders of the faith. Once this meeting is done, Akida will finally be free to work on his plans. He only hopes this old zebra will not be as pandering and convoluted as all others he met... dealing with a religious type, that'll probably prove impossible." 
 zoo_the_coronation:0 "The Coronation"
 zoo_the_coronation_desc:0 "Beat the drums! Prepare the feast! Gather all zebras to Zongo! The last day of Prince Akida has come; today, a King is born! Long live King Akida! Long live Zongo!"
 zoo_enact_the_railroad_plan:0 "Commence The $ZOO_grand_railroad_project$!"
 zoo_enact_the_railroad_plan_desc:0 "With all the formalities and petty politicking that comes with becoming king, Akida is finally free to get his hooves dirty with what he truly always wished for: trains! He envisions locomotives traveling to every corner of the nation, connecting the people and trade wherever they go. Zongo will taste modernity at last!"

 ##Railway program tree
 zoo_railway_1_1:0 "Found an University of Economics"
 zoo_railway_1_1_desc:0 "Having spent the last few years at the University of Economics of Ilkşehir, it's a natural step to want to bring the same innovations he was able to live through to his subjects. One day perhaps, Zongo will be filled with minds dreaming even larger dreams than his own."
 zoo_railway_2_1:0 "Moving Beyond Primitive Theory"
 zoo_railway_2_1_desc:0 "The zebras of Zongo do not live; they survive day to day but never thrive. If he ever hopes to modernise this country, Zongo must go past this lifestyle and develop a modern economy that may serve to create a modern nation."
 zoo_railway_2_2:0 "Invoke Eminent Domain"
 zoo_railway_2_2_desc:0 "Many of the lands where our rails are being built are traditionally owned by the chieftains and their villages, proving a bit of a headache for any construction effort. To ensure all goes smoothly, the crown will compensate the relevant creatures so they can just build over the land without having to skirt around them, saving a great deal of time."
 zoo_railway_3_1:0 "Proclaim Necessity For National Defence"
 zoo_railway_3_1_desc:0 "Many in Zongo are still anxious about what the $ZOO_grand_railroad_project$ means. To ensure his subjects understand and remain calm, Akida will give a speech on the importance of the plan in ensuring Zongo remains safe and protected from foreign threats. An industrialised nation means a safe nation!"
 zoo_railway_3_2:0 "Implement Import-Substitution"
 zoo_railway_3_2_desc:0 "Too much of our fledgling economy has been based around depending on foreign materials and work, when Zongo itself is rich in many resources. If we are ever to truly modernise, we must learn to depend on ourselves, not on others."
 zoo_railway_3_3:0 "Proclaim Necessity For People's Welfare"
 zoo_railway_3_3_desc:0 "Many in Zongo are still anxious about what the $ZOO_grand_railroad_project$ means. To ensure his subjects understand and remain calm, Akida will give a speech on the importance of the plan in ensuring the creatures of Zongo can better enjoy life. An industrialised nation means comfort for all its subjects!"
 zoo_railway_4_1:0 "Entice Foreign Scientists"
 zoo_railway_4_1_desc:0 "His school of economics has proven itself a great success, but it is currently very understaffed, with the king himself occasionally giving more complex lectures o scout out potential aides. To ensure the quality of our teachings remains high, Akida will once again call for bright minds to come to Zongo, willing to pay their knowledge's worth in gold." 
 zoo_railway_4_2:0 "Secure The Railways"
 zoo_railway_4_2_desc:0 "Bandit attacks taking advantage of our construction crews and passing trains have been a problem for way too long. To ensure this does not happen anymore, we will ensure all freight trains have an armored car for protection ensuring our railways are safer."
 zoo_railway_5_1:0 "Study Developmentalist Theory"
 zoo_railway_5_1_desc:0 "One concept that always interested Akida in university was Developmentalism. To grow an underdeveloped nation, one must foster their market variety and put heavy tariffs upon foreign goods. To ensure Zongo's continued economic independence, maybe taking inspirations from such measures would be best."
 zoo_railway_6_1:0 "Public Access To Railways"
 zoo_railway_6_1_desc:0 "With our railway network now spanning our entire mainland, the time has come to open several public lines to ensure easier transport for the average Zebra seeking to cross our land."
 zoo_railway_6_2:0 "Found The Railway Police"
 zoo_railway_6_2_desc:0 "With our economy now more developed and our country increasingly interconnected, criminals have made great use of this to expand their operations. We should expand on our program of armored trains and create a rapidly deployable police force."
 zoo_railway_7_1:0 "Zongolese Developmentalism"
 zoo_railway_7_1_desc:0 "The theories of Developmentalism have been utilised to great effect, however, it is clear that there have been consequences to it. Perhaps loosening some of their ideas to better fit our subjects would ensure it reaches its maximum potential, after all, zebras aren't just numbers." 
 zoo_railway_8_1:0 "Caring For The Vulnerable"
 zoo_railway_8_1_desc:0 "We have made great strides with our economic development, the locomotives proving themselves up to the King's expectations. With our economy at an all-time high, perhaps we may ensure that no Zebra goes hungry again through government assistance. A nation is defined by how their poorest creatures live, this is surely the right way to go."
 zoo_railway_8_2:0 "Decrease Deficit Spending"
 zoo_railway_8_2_desc:0 "We have made great strides with our economic development, the locomotives proving themselves up to the King's expectations. With our economy at an all-time high, the Queen-Mother advises us to cut some corners to ensure more profit is made. More money means more investments, this is surely the right way to go."
 zoo_railway_9_1:0 "Zongo Connected By Rail"
 zoo_railway_9_1_desc:0 "Akida could not be prouder of what he has seen. Whistles and smoke fill the sky as locomotives connect every corner of our mainland. From Zamu to Zuba, from Zupinamba to Zongo, all have bore witness to the great successes of modernity and to the genius of our King."

 ##Industrial tree
 zoo_industrial_1_1:0 "Create Zamu Industrial Center"
 zoo_industrial_1_1_desc:0 "With its vast plains, Zamu is the prime location to develop our nascent industry. We will form an industrial center to better direct and kickstart our developments in the region."
 zoo_industrial_2_1:0 "Fund Tungsten Research"
 zoo_industrial_2_1_desc:0 "Tungsten has long been overlooked as a strategic material in Zongo due to its limited uses, however, with new ages of construction and production having reached the world, tungsten finds itself ever more valuable. It would be wise to open new mines to better exploit their potential."
 zoo_industrial_2_2:0 "Refurb Zmpangu Weapon Forges"
 zoo_industrial_2_2_desc:0 "The Zmpangu weapon forges served our armies well in ancient conflicts and the more recent Zebluan war, they are however not up to modern standards. Funding a refurbishment would prove beneficial to its production efficiency and allow for the greater production of weapons."
 zoo_industrial_3_1:0 "Fund Crystal Research"
 zoo_industrial_3_1_desc:0 "Magic crystals have long been overlooked in Zongo due to their limited uses, however, with the advent of magical weapons and other arcane uses, crystals find themselves ever more valuable. It would be wise to open new mines to better exploit their potential"
 zoo_industrial_3_2:0 "Expand Zmpangu Mines"
 zoo_industrial_3_2_desc:0 "The forges of Zmpangu have been historically kept running by a symbiotic relationship with the iron mines beneath it. It is only natural that with forges being expanded, so must the mines keep up with their advancements. We must dig deeply to fulfil our true potential."
 zoo_industrial_3_3:0 "Open Up To Foreign Interests"
 zoo_industrial_3_3_desc:0 "Our economy has been closed to foreign exports for too long. With our surplus of natural resources, Zongo has much to gain by trading with any who will pay. "
 zoo_industrial_4_1:0 "Expand Arms Facilities"
 zoo_industrial_4_1_desc:0 "The triumphant industrial boom in Zamu has filled the royal coffers with surplus capital. We can now replicate that success nationwide by investing these gains into a massive expansion of our state arsenals, creating new centres dedicated to not only arms production, but to truly make our military self-sufficient, with everything they could need from rations to uniforms being produced domestically."
 zoo_industrial_4_2:0 "Construct New Industrial Parks"
 zoo_industrial_4_2_desc:0 "The triumphant industrial boom in Zamu has filled the royal coffers with surplus capital. We can now replicate that success nationwide by investing these gains into new industrial parks following the Zamu model, allowing for greater efficiency and control as we replicate its productive triumphs across the nation."
 zoo_industrial_5_1:0 "Prioritise Goods Production"
 zoo_industrial_5_1_desc:0 "Following the foundation set by Zamu, we shall continue to expand our factories and industry. Goods shall keep flowing, the economy shall keep growing, Zongo will reach heights never before imagined. The line keeps going up and the limits are constantly being redefined as Akida's plans prove ever more effective."
 zoo_industrial_5_2:0 "Prioritise Arms Production"
 zoo_industrial_5_2_desc:0 "Following the foundation set by Zamu, we shall continue to expand our factories and industry. Arms will flow off the factory lines and soon our army stores will be filled with brand new weaponry to protect Zongo.Our arms production keeps going up and the limits are constantly being redefined as Akida's plans prove ever more effective."
 zoo_industrial_6_1:0 "Zongo's Industrial Revolution"
 zoo_industrial_6_1_desc:0 "King Akida has performed the miracle of the century! Once a backward country like its neighbors, Zongo has burst onto the international scene as the world's fastest-growing economy! Others cannot help but bask in awe as the news spreads of the successes of the young King." 

 ##Politics/research tree
 zoo_research_1_1:0 "Review The System Of Chieftains"
 zoo_research_1_1_desc:0 "While nominally loyal to the king, the decentralisation of our system has led to chieftains holding great authority within their domains, leading to corruption and stagnation of lands that could be better utilised. Perhaps it's time to use our authority and remind them who's in charge."
 zoo_research_2_1:0 "Urban Literacy Programs"
 zoo_research_2_1_desc:0 "Even inside our largest settlements, illiteracy is a common problem, with only a limited few such as clergy members and those who can afford to study being able to read. The head of faith has proposed a four-step plan to ensure the whole country can read; counting with the help of the faith as teachers. We'll start these reforms in the urban centers and see how well they work."
 zoo_research_2_2:0 "A System Of Royal Law"
 zoo_research_2_2_desc:0 "Our country currently lacks a formal legal system. The only guaranteed right is freedom from enslavement, with other matters handled on a case-by-case basis. This system is ineffective, so we will be formalising a system of royal law to better encompass all of Zongo."
 zoo_research_3_1:0 "Rural Literacy Programs"
 zoo_research_3_1_desc:0 "With literacy programs being a success among the cities, Ayana's plan seems to be working. The next step is to ensure they reach our more isolated and rural communities to ensure they are also literate."
 zoo_research_3_2:0 "Programs For The Poor"
 zoo_research_3_2_desc:0 "Our focus on the $ZOO_grand_railroad_project$ has led some communities to end displaced, especially the most vulnerable members of our society. To ensure we do not harm our people more than help them, programs to assist the poor will be set up so they may once again stand on their hooves."
 zoo_research_3_3:0 "Limits Of Emergency Rule"
 zoo_research_3_3_desc:0 "One matter as of yet unresolved is that of emergency rule. Traditionally the monarch has always held the ability to declare wartime powers for the safety of Zongo but with a more modern formalised system now being worked on, it is a good opportunity to better define under what situations a monarch might use these powers and bypass the council entirely."
 zoo_research_4_1:0 "No Peasant Mare Left Behind"
 zoo_research_4_1_desc:0 "With our literacy programs succeeding in both the cities and rural communities, one might think we're done. However, the poorest and marginalised of society cannot be forgotten. As part of our four step plan, even the most unfortunate among us will have the opportunity to read and write so they may have a better chance!"
 zoo_research_4_2:0 "A 1 on 1 With The Faith"
 zoo_research_4_2_desc:0 "To ensure the faith is onboard with our plans, the king has arranged a one-on-one meeting with Ayana so they can talk it out. While the Queen-Mother told him she could go in his stead, Akida ensured this is something he must do to learn more as a king."
 zoo_research_4_3:0 "The Mobilisation Decree"
 zoo_research_4_3_desc:0 "The world of today is filled with too many wars to keep up with, if Zongo is not careful it may soon find itself swept away by them too. With the unification of zebrakind seemingly more and more relevant to the current world context, Zongo cannot be caught off-guard. If any will unify the Southeast, it will be us; for that, our soldiers must be ready."
 zoo_research_4_4:0 "Encourage Chieftains To Join The Court"
 zoo_research_4_4_desc:0 "Akida does not wish to get rid of the Chieftains, even if many of them seem to fear that for some reason. To showcase his willingness to work together, he'll invite any who can benefit his efforts to officially join the court as his advisors."
 zoo_research_4_4_tt:0 "Unlock several new Chieftain advisors"
 zoo_research_5_1:0 "Syncretism Between The Faith And The State"
 zoo_research_5_1_desc:0 "As our plans for the future of Zongo will encompass vast territories with a populace of many religions, Akida cannot allow for the alienation of the many to support the few. A line must be drawn between the Faith and the State preserving our values while protecting the rights of those who may believe different from us."
 zoo_research_5_2:0 "Religious-Secular Education Pact"
 zoo_research_5_2_desc:0 "With clergy-creatures serving as teachers in our primary schools, it's essential for them to remember that faith and literacy are not all they teach now, but formal sciences. While some may grumble, Akida and Ayana have already drafted the standards they must follow."
 zoo_research_5_3:0 "Queen Mother's Advice"
 zoo_research_5_3_desc:0 "The Queen-Mother seems to be worried about the extent and speed of Akida's reforms possibly leading to the weakening of royal authority. She has called for a meeting to discuss these concerns in private. While the king is sure his mother is just being overprotective, he will hear her out nonetheless."
 zoo_research_6_1:0 "Zongo's Modern Constitution"
 zoo_research_6_1_desc:0 "Zongo has come a long way from the outdated state it found itself in just a few years ago. To formalize all the changes since then, the royal legal code will be adapted into a modern constitution! Queen-Mother has been warning about the risks of formalising certain limits to monarchical power, but Akida knows she's being overzealous as always; he hopes she'll feel calmer once this goes through."
 zoo_research_6_1_tt:0 "High influence of the Queen-mother during the signing of the constitution may have unintended consequences!"






 ##Sambovato tree
 zoo_sambovato_1_1:0 "Import Through The Nacre Gate"
 zoo_sambovato_1_1_desc:0 "The Nacre Gate is a busy shipping lane, connecting Chisimbi to the rest of the world and serving as a vital trade hub between all the Southeast nations and the Ancient Pact. With our treaty in place, we shall reap the benefits of cheaper imports to further our industrialisation efforts."
 zoo_sambovato_2_1:0 "Attend A Royal Party"
 zoo_sambovato_2_1_desc:0 "For a royal, social meetings are key, be they balls, dinners or other social events, they serve as an opportunity to forge connections, ensure allies remain satisfied and show your own etiquette to others... King Akida hates all of this. However, to ensure he is not disrespectful to our new allies, he will join Queen Ceyda Vatosoa for a party to better cement our alliance."
 zoo_sambovato_2_2:0 "Share Policing Methods"
 zoo_sambovato_2_2_desc:0 "We wish to show Queen Ceyda Vatosoa that our industrialisation efforts are not only useful for economical needs, but they may also directly help protect the country. As a gift to commemorate our alliance, we will be sending them a few of our armoured trains so they may see their effectiveness in action. After all, everyone knows mares love trains."
 zoo_sambovato_3_1:0 "Bind Sambovato Forever"
 zoo_sambovato_3_1_desc:0 "Railways cross across the island from Akoradriakarova to Tsenalakana, as factory lines produce non-stop and the harbours are busier than ever. Sambovato has truly grown much due to our efforts... their industry is now so tied to ours that they can never leave without risking total collapse. If their industry gets any more tied to ours, it would not be a lie to say that they might as well join Zongo." 


 ##Southern tree
 zoo_south_1_1:0 "Embrace Pan-Zongolese Culture"
 zoo_south_1_1_desc:0 "With the whole basin once again united under our flag, we should take advantage of our shared Zongolese roots to facilitate the reintegration of Tanaigha and Melahaka as provinces under Zongo."
 zoo_south_2_1:0 "Merge Facilities Into $ZOO_infantry_equipment_company$"
 zoo_south_2_1_desc:0 "The Tanaighan weapon facilities could be repurposed by us and given over to the general management of the $ZOO_infantry_equipment_company$. This would allow them cheaper access to expansion opportunities and incentivise their growth."
 zoo_south_2_2:0 "Utilise Melahakan Trade-Ports"
 zoo_south_2_2_desc:0 "The Melahakan ports are far better positioned for southern trade than Zamu. We can leverage this to attract more merchant traffic and secure new deals, furthering our industrialisation."
 zoo_south_3_1:0 "The Tanaighan Steelyards"
 zoo_south_3_1_desc:0 "The region of Tanaigha is very rich in steel, however there seem to be deeper mines that the tribes had no method of extracting. With modern tools now being employed, we may better exploit these abundant resources."
 zoo_south_3_2:0 "Promote Pan-Zongolese Officers"
 zoo_south_3_2_desc:0 "As the south is further connected to the rest of Zongo, many begin to rediscover their ties to our shared Zongolese heritage, choosing to join the army to protect this old homeland they are learning to be proud of again."
 zoo_south_3_3:0 "New Zesalampy Rubber Facility"
 zoo_south_3_3_desc:0 "The island of Zesalampy is very rich in rubber, however it is not yet extracted to its full potential. With modern tools now being employed, we may better exploit these abundant resources." 
 zoo_south_4_1:0 "Repurpose the School of Tanaigha"
 zoo_south_4_1_desc:0 "While the school of Tanaigha currently serves as a simple learning place for basic teachings, its positioning in the south lends itself for us to better expand our education to be better spread in Zongo. We'll repurpose the school to be our newest university, with some new courses focused on avionics and aerodynamics."
 zoo_south_4_2:0 "Restore the Naval School Of Zaredlindi"
 zoo_south_4_2_desc:0 "While long abandoned ever since Zongo was forced to leave the region, the school is in surprisingly good condition. We will do some minor restorations and soon its doors will once again be open for aspiring zebras of the sea."
 zoo_south_5_1:0 "Zongo's Expanded Southern Program"
 zoo_south_5_1_desc:0 "With the south having reached the end of the first phase of the program, we should set up regional facilities to better utilise its specialties and expand our development plans. Be it through the sea or through the airs, the south has given us a way to reach our hooves into the future."
 zoo_south_5_1_tt:0 "The facility that will be constructed depends upon which school we invested in." 

 ##Western tree
 zoo_west_1_1:0 "Legacy of the Zebluan War"
 zoo_west_1_1_desc:0 "After so much loss, Akida has finally avenged the death of his father and gotten their rightful claims on Ithebra and Mzinga back... however, this war ended with much more than that. Now in control of most of the Southeast, Akida must decide whatever shall be done with these lands."
 zoo_west_2_1:0 "The Roaman City-States"
 zoo_west_2_1_desc:0 "The fortified cities of the Assini have a long tradition of shifting allegiances for survival, with their newfound legion still a fairly new and fragile construct. We will not conquer them, but make loyalty to Zongo the most rational choice, utilising trade and protection to draw these pragmatic city-states closer into our systems."
 zoo_west_2_2:0 "The Houses of Imba-Zaru"
 zoo_west_2_2_desc:0 "Historically home to 6 prevalent houses ever since their monarch died some hundreds of years ago, we must decide how to deal with this unusual system and ensure stability reigns once again in the region."
 zoo_west_3_1:0 "A Future For Ex-Slaves"
 zoo_west_3_1_desc:0 "The slaves under Tzhimane did their best to free themselves from oppression, that is a just cause, even if their methods were extreme. With Zongo being free from slavery, we will show these creatures that they can now rest, a free future awaits them."
 zoo_west_3_2:0 "Divide and Conquer"
 zoo_west_3_2_desc:0 "It is surprising that Zeblu survived as long as it did, being a union of many unruly tribes that take every opportunity to quarrel amongst themselves, only ever being united by strong figures to lead them towards one unified goal. Now, with no Khan at the top, exploiting these rifts will be an easy way to ensure Zeblu remains disunited, now and forever."
 zoo_west_3_3:0 "Mismanagement of Hyena Proportions"
 zoo_west_3_3_desc:0 "The Hyenas of Twizanyika were... not the greatest at their job. Their bureaucracy is a mess, plagued by piracy, plantation owners, and slaves; it's a miracle it functioned as long as it did. We could try salvaging it, but maybe it's best to just bring the whole thing down."
 zoo_west_4_1:0 "The Roaman-Zongolese Citizenry"
 zoo_west_4_1_desc:0 "The Assini do not value sentiment as they value more concrete things, such as strength and security. Simply granting them citizenship is a meaningless gesture. Instead, we will tie their privileges directly to the Zongolese crown, compelling them to invest in our state's stability for their own benefit. They will certainly adapt to their new circumstances as they always have."
 zoo_west_4_2:0 "Imba-Zaru's Future With Zongo"
 zoo_west_4_2_desc:0 "Imba-Zaru's house system is quickly adapting to their new circumstances, not that dissimilar than our own chieftain system. It seems the creatures there may accept Zongo as their new home faster than expected." 
 zoo_west_5_1:0 "Dealing With The Mercenaries"
 zoo_west_5_1_desc:0 "The wars of Chisimbi attracted many foreigners to the region, none of them do-gooders. Mercenaries, mostly in the employ of the slaving Mavelas, are now stranded with no home. We could just put them in boats and send them away to be someone else's problem... or we could give them jobs to ensure their talents aren't used against us."
 zoo_west_5_2:0 "Learn From The Zebluan Tribes"
 zoo_west_5_2_desc:0 "For all we can criticize from our old enemies, calling their armies weak is not one of those things. Known for their speed in the battlefield trampling all who stood against them, it seems the Zebluan can prove themselves useful by teaching us the tactics that once beat us in the battlefield."
 zoo_west_5_3:0 "The Former Pirates Of Zongo"
 zoo_west_5_3_desc:0 "Many of the pirates from Twizanyika have found new professions in transporting goods from our factories abroad. It may prove useful to also employ some of them into the navy and utilise their knowledge incase the Peaceful sea were ever to become less so..."
 zoo_west_6_1:0 "Utilise Roam's Merchants"
 zoo_west_6_1_desc:0 "The merchant guilds of Roam are masters of commerce renowned throughout all of Chisimbi. While the war may have gotten rid of Roam, it did not get rid of their vast fortunes or deep expertise. Harnessing their talents will be a significant boon to the $ZOO_grand_railroad_project$."
 zoo_west_6_2:0 "The Griffon Quarter's Offer"
 zoo_west_6_2_desc:0 "South Chisimbi has been home to a unique phenomenon for three hundred years: a Griffon population known as Kompels. Their architecture is phenomenal; with their construction skills, we can ensure the foundations of our newest structures are sound."
 zoo_west_7_1:0 "A New Legacy In Zongo"
 zoo_west_7_1_desc:0 "The regions of Tzhimane have been scarred by slavery, plutocrats, and war, but their inhabitants may yet find hope under Zongo. With all slaves unchained and any remnants of the Mavelas taking their place in chains, North Chisimbi finds itself with something it may have never expected: Freedom."
 zoo_west_7_2:0 "The Zebluan Grainbasket"
 zoo_west_7_2_desc:0 "The fertile Zebluan plains have long served as a steady supply of grain to keep their war efforts going for as long as they needed. We may now exploit that to feed a whole nation, It's unlikely their khan expected their lands to be serving as a grainbasket for their oldest enemy. The departed king must be laughing from the grave."
 zoo_west_7_3:0 "The Hyenas Of Zongo"
 zoo_west_7_3_desc:0 "While they did enslave much of the local population, it does not mean all Hyenas were slavers. Those that have left those practices behind may now join under a rightful banner: the banner of progress!"
 zoo_west_8_1:0 "Invest In Chromium"
 zoo_west_8_1_desc:0 "While our army strategy has no immediate use for chromium, there is still value in investing into this resource. It will be a valuable export to fund our programmes, eventually if we field a modern armoured force, it would be wise to have it already being extracted."
 zoo_west_8_2:0 "Crystals Are The Future"
 zoo_west_8_2_desc:0 "While traditionally our usage of Crystals has been low, countries around the world have shown great interest in buying them from us. Expanding our mining operations could thus allow for further export opportunities and who knows, maybe one day we will find a use for it ourselves."
 zoo_west_9_1:0 "Utilise Tzhimane's University"
 zoo_west_9_1_desc:0 "The Mavelas were scum, but it cannot be denied that the Tzhimane university is one of the best in the region, perhaps even rivaling the university where our king studied. Of course, it previously served to perpetuate a cycle of pain by aggrandizing their richest and allowing them the base to keep in power. Now, their university will serve to educate all, even those slaves that were once kept there." 

 ##Army tree
 zoo_army_1_1:0 "Revival of the Royal Guard"
 zoo_army_1_1_desc:0 "Our Royal Guard has stood proudly as defenders of Zongo, but there are still scars from the Zebluan war permeating through their ranks. We shall begin further recruitment to once again fill the ranks of our Royal Guard."
 zoo_army_2_1:0 "Modern Infantry Corps"
 zoo_army_2_1_desc:0 "As he studied in Senturya, Akida got to see the armed forces of today, marching proudly with firearms at their sides. While our army is proud too, it is apparent how behind the times it is. We shall put our efforts into modernising our technologies and doctrines to better fit with modern warfare."
 zoo_army_2_2:0 "New Officers, New Purpose"
 zoo_army_2_2_desc:0 "Traditionally marked by Chieftains leading our armies, they are proud and brash, leading to brash decisions unfit for the modern battlefield. No, the officers of today are not chosen from birth, they shall be chosen by their merit to lead troops and protect our home."
 zoo_army_3_1:0 "Reassert Authority Over Tanaigha"
 zoo_army_3_1_desc:0 "We have retaken the lands of the Tanaigha and have begun to reintegrate the lands into our kingdom. Their tribes may be weary as of now, but they will learn to see themselves as Zongolese again soon enough."
 zoo_army_3_2:0 "Reunite The Zongo Basin"
 zoo_army_3_2_desc:0 "The Zongo Basin has historically been integrated into our kingdom. However, two centuries ago, the southern lands took advantage of an unstable time and repudiated our rule to break away. This cannot stand. With our armies in a better shape than before, we will march and regain our rightful control over the Basin."
 zoo_army_3_3:0 "Repudiate The Melahakan Secession"
 zoo_army_3_3_desc:0 "We have retaken the lands of the Melahaka and have begun to reintegrate the lands into our kingdom. Due to their proximity with Sambovato, they have sturdy ports for trade, resources to tap and some interesting technologies acquired from foreign trade. This is a perfect base from which to project influence over the Peaceful Seas and the Great Horn."
 zoo_army_4_1:0 "Study Tanaigha's Planes"
 zoo_army_4_1_desc:0 "Tanaigha had utilised planes during the war to great effectiveness. We should study the surviving aircraft as examples to further Zongo's armed forces. We will not be limited to ruling the land, but also the skies in due time!" 
 zoo_army_4_2:0 "Expand The $ZOO_grand_railroad_project$ South"
 zoo_army_4_2_desc:0 "As our territory has expanded to once again encompass the Zongo Basin, it is natural that our industrialisation efforts will follow, bringing these regions up to stand side by side with all of Zongo."
 zoo_army_4_3:0 "Adopt Elite Charger Units"
 zoo_army_4_3_desc:0 "The warriors of Melahaka may have lost the war, but we would be fools to ignore the prowess they showed on the battlefield. We shall integrate the proud Chargers of Melahaka into our Royal Guard."
 zoo_army_5_1:0 "Assess Zaikirian Threat"
 zoo_army_5_1_desc:0 "Zaikiria has long been a bag of problems, with the Lan-Kir occasionally raiding us and the Matriarchs of Kiria keeping a greedy eye on the region. We must focus our attention there and decide on a course of action."
 zoo_army_5_2:0 "Treatise With Sambovato"
 zoo_army_5_2_desc:0 "The small island state of Sambovato has long been a hub for regional trade. With their lack of mainland interests, perhaps we could formulate a treaty for both our countries to stand together, allowing us to tap their potential and assist with their industrialisation, in exchange for us to formally stand together as allies."
 zoo_army_6_1:0 "Plan For Zebra Unification"
 zoo_army_6_1_desc:0 "Our Pan-Zongolese ambitions are fulfilled, but we will never be secure while Chisimbi remains, their leaders viewing our lands as just another target. We must prepare for inevitable conflict with them, but if we'll be fighting anyways, perhaps a Pan-Zebra outlook could allow us to better deal with the region and even integrate them into our industrialisation effors."
 zoo_army_6_2:0 "An Army To Be Proud Of"
 zoo_army_6_2_desc:0 "Parades with modern weaponry, prestigious military academies and more have turned the Royal Army into a mere force to defend our borders to an institution our citizens are proud to join and look up to."
 zoo_army_6_3:0 "Secure The Eastern Peninsula"
 zoo_army_6_3_desc:0 "The Zebridea region has long been isolated from the rest of the Southeast, with their sprawling jungles and alien fauna, all past attempts to gain influence there were short-lived. Today, as Zongo stands modernised and strong, perhaps it is finally time to swiftly end these tribal states and bring the Lost Jungle to modernity."

 ##Eastern tree #May change up later
 zoo_east_1_1:0 "Naval Authority Over Manelilipol"
 zoo_east_1_1_desc:0 "Some of the southernmost reaches of the southeast can be found in the lands of the Maglibing. Surrounded by mountains, the small settlement of Manelilipol shall serve as the foundation for our fleet to rest and expand their influence in the southernmost reaches of Zebrica."
 zoo_east_1_2:0 "Expand The Cape's Garrisons" 
 zoo_east_1_2_desc:0 "The religious types of Talarayi have been putting up heavy resistance even after the destruction of their sacred temple. We shall expand the garrisons by the cape to ensure they do not harm themselves more than they already have."
 zoo_east_1_3:0 "Plan Naugdaw's Railway Lines"
 zoo_east_1_3_desc:0 "Our engineers are having a hard time planning the railways for Naugdaw, their marshes being some of the flattest land in Zebridea, which only highlights the difficulty of railway construction here. If we can get our plans to work here, then no challenge will prove too much to Zongolese ingenuity."
 zoo_east_2_1:0 "The Tampuk $ZOO_grand_railroad_project$"
 zoo_east_2_1_desc:0 "The lands of the Maglibing tribes hold many untapped resources, which they have been both unwilling and unable to utilise. With our tools and capabilities, this land is sure to prove very profitable soon."
 zoo_east_2_2:0 "Increase Naugdaw Rubber Exports"
 zoo_east_2_2_desc:0 "The Lost Jungle holds a bounty of resources, one of which as of yet remaining mostly untapped is the potential for the extraction of rubber. Many countries hold great interest in it and if we were to expand our operations in Naugdaw, we would be sure to see profits rise."
 zoo_east_3_1:0 "Our Cousins Of Maglibing"
 zoo_east_3_1_desc:0 "While we may be very distant, the Zebras of Maglibing still are family to us, as are all other Zebras of the southeast. In due time they'll learn to leave their traditional ways behind just as we did." 
 zoo_east_3_2:0 "Utilise Tampuk's Resources"
 zoo_east_3_2_desc:0 "As is the case in most of the Lost Jungle, the resources in Tampuk have never been properly exploited despite being filled with rare strategic resources. Expanding our mining operations in the region could prove very beneficial."
 zoo_east_3_3:0 "Our Cousins Of Naugdaw"
 zoo_east_3_3_desc:0 "While we may be very distant, the Zebras of Naugdaw still are family to us, as are all other Zebras of the southeast. In due time they'll learn to leave their traditional ways behind just as we did."
 zoo_east_4_1:0 "Maglibings Infrastructure Program"
 zoo_east_4_1_desc:0 "Maglibing is in dire need of some infrastructure, the land being marked by mountains, jungles and hills, all with little to no roads to speak of, the natives have traditionally relied on their own expertise or beasts of burden to traverse these lands. These times will soon be nothing but memory, railways and roads starting to fill the sights of the region."
 zoo_east_4_2:0 "Naugdaws Infrastructure Program"
 zoo_east_4_2_desc:0 "Naugdaw is in dire need of some infrastructure, the land being marked by marshes, jungles and rivers, all with little to no roads to speak of, the natives have traditionally relied on their own expertise or beasts of burden to traverse these lands. These times will soon be nothing but memory, railways and roads starting to fill the sights of the region."
 zoo_east_5_1:0 "The Creatures Of The Golden City"
 zoo_east_5_1_desc:0 "At first the creatures of Talarayi resisted like no others, even going as far as blowing up their own religious temple in a desperate attempt to get us away from them. It is regrettable that it came to that, but we believe that in time, as roads and rails crisscross the southeast and the standard of living improves, they may one day see themselves as Zongolese."
 zoo_east_5_2:0 "Expand Naugdaws Railway Plans"
 zoo_east_5_2_desc:0 "The plan has gone swimmingly in Naugdaw. The marshes have served as a foundation for rail lines that now spread across the northern coast of Zebridea. Our work may not yet be done here, but we can be proud of achieving this level of infrastructure in a land that had never seen it before."

 ##Zaikirian tree
 zoo_north_1_1:0 "The Threat Of Lan Kir"
 zoo_north_1_1_desc:0 "The fanatics over at Lan Kir are still standing, we are fortunate they have not yet sent their Nirik warriors against us in a frenzy. To ensure peace, we must nip this problem in the bud."
 zoo_north_1_2:0 "Zaikirian Post-War Situation"
 zoo_north_1_2_desc:0 "Thankfully, the crazed warriors of Lan Kir have been dealt with without need of our intervention. We may now more carefully examine the situation to decide upon our course of action."
 zoo_north_2_1:0 "Secure A Hold Over Zaikiria"
 zoo_north_2_1_desc:0 "Kiria has not yet come to deal with their southern kind. Following the advice of Queen-Mother, we shall swiftly deal with Zaikiria to better secure Zongolese interests. Of course, we'll allow them self rule, this is just a temporary measure. If we don't protect the region, we'll just be allowing the Kirians to do whatever they please; at least that's what mother claims..."
 zoo_north_2_2:0 "Mutually-Beneficial Partition Of Zaikiria"
 zoo_north_2_2_desc:0 "While we have come to occupy the lands of Zaikiria, it is not in our best interests to hold onto all of it. We will offer a deal to the members of Sen Kihn and Khamrin that survived the Lan-Kir onslaught, allowing them to keep control of the region in exchange for some mutually beneficial trade deals, with which both parties can leave satisfied."
 zoo_north_2_3:0 "Export To The Zaikirians"
 zoo_north_2_3_desc:0 "Zaikiria is currently at peace, leaving little pretext for intervention. Let us take advantage of peaceful times while they exist, foster relations and do trade with these Zaikirian statelets."
 zoo_north_3_1:0 "Secure Zaikiria's Resources"
 zoo_north_3_1_desc:0 "As planned before our occupation of the region, an allied administration will be set up for Zaikiria. It will serve to better secure Zongolese interests by assisting them in extracting their resources and ensuring they are kept safe from Kirian imperialism."
 zoo_north_3_2:0 "Strategic Zaikirian Mineral Rights"
 zoo_north_3_2_desc:0 "Due to our efforts in helping pacify the Zaikirian region, surely the Zaikirians will allow us to propose investment opportunities in certain key resources they hold that could prove of great value to our country."
 zoo_north_3_3:0 "Expand Trade With Zaikiria"
 zoo_north_3_3_desc:0 "Like the rest of the southeast, Zaikiria is rich in various useful materials. Taking advantage of the peacetime, we'll ensure stable trading relations are kept for as long as they last."
 zoo_north_3_4:0 "Gather Intel On Our 'Partners'"
 zoo_north_3_4_desc:0 "While we may have peace for now, peace will not last forever. It is in our best interests to keep a close eye on the movements in the region, the friend of today may very well be the foe of tomorrow."


 ##Kirian tree
 zoo_kiria_1_1:0 "Kirian Elephant In The Room"
 zoo_kiria_1_1_desc:0 "For a millenia the Marekong has separated the Zebran lands from those of the Kirin. Now with all East-Zebrican Zebran lands united, the Queen-Mother has implored we send a delegation to Kiria to negotiate them remaining on their side of the river for the next millenia. Were we to be rebuffed though and should Kirin aggression prove inevitable, it may be in our interests to prepare for any Kirin attack."
 zoo_kiria_2_1:0 "Fortify the Marekong"
 zoo_kiria_2_1_desc:0 "With war now inevitable, efforts must be made to fortify the ever so strategic Marekong border which has protected the Zebran lands for millenia from Kirin aggression."
 zoo_kiria_2_2:0 "Rally The Council"
 zoo_kiria_2_2_desc:0 "Our primary focus must be on ensuring the unity of the state in this great and upcoming conflict. A unified council could prove vital for the conflict to come."
 zoo_kiria_3_1:0 "One Final Grand Effort"
 zoo_kiria_3_1_desc:0 "All of the Zebra know of the great conflict that is to come. We must encourage them, push them beyond their comforts and ensure we can all rally for this final grand effort for our mutual survival."
 zoo_kiria_3_2:0 "Temporarily Loosen Railway Restrictions"
 zoo_kiria_3_2_desc:0 "While the $ZOO_grand_railroad_project$ has brought us great prosperity. The centralised planning imposed on the construction of railways may prove harmful for the upcoming war effort. On the advice of Mani Zuba, temporarily we will allow the army to utilise their engineers to build emergency railways bypassing restrictions."
 zoo_kiria_3_3:0 "Prepare Against Angry Kirin"
 zoo_kiria_3_3_desc:0 "One thing is certain, were we to be in control of Kirian lands, there will be agitators. The Queen-Mother has proposed a bold set of decrees and plans for the administration to enact in occupied territories to ensure no Kirin gets hurt in a futile attempt to undermine us."
 zoo_kiria_4_1:0 "The Fate Of Kiria"
 zoo_kiria_4_1_desc:0 "Millions of Kirin are now under our rule. It never having been our intention to conquer the Kirin homeland, the council must endeavour to formulate a plan for the future governance of Kiria."

 ##Advanced Army tree
 zoo_advanced_army_1_1:0 "Lessons From The Unification Wars"
 zoo_advanced_army_1_1_desc:0 "For many of the recent years we have found ourselves at war to fullfill the dream of the Pan-Zongolese state and defend against the inevitable aggression of our neighbours. During these wars it has become increasingly clear that while the modern structure of our army has proven effective, our usage of modern weaponry could be greatly improved. Several officers with the cooperation of the intelligentsia have drawn up plans for the modernization of our weaponry and logistics making use of our large railway networks to carry heavy artillery and supplies to the front."
 zoo_advanced_army_2_1:0 "The Queen of the Battlefield"
 zoo_advanced_army_2_1_desc:0 "There is little doubt that artillery is the future of the Zongolese Army. A large enough howitzer can fire shells of such destructive power that few weapons can hope to exceed them. While other nations may grasp for a way to move guns of such size close enough to their targets to fire upon, our extensive railway network can easily handle them."
 zoo_advanced_army_2_2:0 "Standardised Logistics"
 zoo_advanced_army_2_2_desc:0 "Although unification with our neighbours vastly swelled our army's numbers, it is currently armed and equipped with a hodge-podge of local weapons, uniforms and gear. Integrated units therefore remain difficult to maintain and resupply. We must replace equipment from conquered states with standardised Zongolese equivalents to ensure the Zongolese Army functions as the single force that it is."
 zoo_advanced_army_3_1:0 "The Importance of CSC"
 zoo_advanced_army_3_1_desc:0 "While often overlooked in favour of more glamorous active combatants, combat support companies are equally important. They provide soldiers with valuable supplies, medical attention, reconnaissance, and many other necessities besides. By reviewing and reforming our CSCs where needed, we can ensure they continue assisting their parent units to the best of their abilities at any time."
 zoo_advanced_army_3_2:0 "A Doctrine of Shock and Awe"
 zoo_advanced_army_3_2_desc:0 "There is little doubt that Zongolese artillery is the best in the continent, and our railroads can transport them to any battlefield where they are needed. Capitalising on these facts, we can develop new shock and awe tactics; terrifying our enemies into submission with the deafening fire of our guns and the battlecries of our assault troops before they can regroup and counterattack."
 zoo_advanced_army_3_3:0 "Alchemists in the Field"
 zoo_advanced_army_3_3_desc:0 "Alchemy is the pride of zebrakind. Zongo is no exception, and as our society modernises so must this art. In particular, the applications of alchemy on the battlefield show great promise, from healing potions for wounded troops to elixirs of strength and speed, to name but a few. Exploiting these potential avenues of research will surely grant us many boons over our enemies."
 zoo_advanced_army_4_1:0 "Loud Like Thunder"
 zoo_advanced_army_4_1_desc:0 "Victory in the field depends on our artillery, the most powerful weapon in our arsenal. As such, the training and upkeep of these units must take top priority, from the recruitment of skilled gunners, to the scheduling of regular firing drills and the maintenance of their weapons. When our enemies face us, they will be met with the deafening thunder of our guns, reducing them to ash and dust."
 zoo_advanced_army_4_2:0 "Quiet as the Night"
 zoo_advanced_army_4_2_desc:0 "There are many arms in the Zongolese arsenal. Our special forces are perhaps the most subtle of them, but used wisely they are also one of the most effective. With proper training, we can ensure these troops can inflict maximum damage on their targets with minimum loss of life. They shall be our silent assassins, slaying our foes in the dark of night before vanishing once again."
 zoo_advanced_army_5_1:0 "Our Last Argument"
 zoo_advanced_army_5_1_desc:0 "Generals are fond of saying that artillery is a rulers' last argument, and Zongo is the best of all polemicists. Our engineers ensure our guns can fire their mighty shells at all hours of an offensive, and our trained gunners can blast an enemy position to dust as our troops advance. Let us continue perfecting our fiery rhetoric, so that the world falls silent when we speak."
 zoo_advanced_army_5_2:0 "Big Guns Never Tire"
 zoo_advanced_army_5_2_desc:0 "Zongo's divisions are armed with artillery of all sizes, from small mountain pieces to great siege howitzers; pieces our enemies possess as well. We must therefore develop ever larger calibres to ensure none of our rivals can ever exceed us in firepower. Though our guards may sleep and our ships may lay at anchor, our foes will know full well that the big guns never tire."
 zoo_advanced_army_5_3:0 "Prepared for it All"
 zoo_advanced_army_5_3_desc:0 "While our armed forces can batter any landforces into the ground, the threat remains of our army becoming overwhelmed by heavily armoured units or attacks from the sky. For the safety our groundforces, we must invest into supportive weaponry specifically designed to counter our greatest weaknesses."
 zoo_advanced_army_6_1:0 "A Unified Modern Military"
 zoo_advanced_army_6_1_desc:0 "With pride we can now look upon our groundforces who can in harmony batter the enemy with heavy artillery barrages while our infantry swoops in for the kill. We have made great use of our strengths and developed plans to counter our weaknesses yet still, there is always more to improve. A final review will be drawn up about the state of our armed forces so no soldier will ever die due to a failure of process."

It does not matter anymore, I have taken the reins once more and I'll teach him what happens when you can't play quietly. Playtime is over, the adults are back in charge. Hopefully by the time I'm done he'll understand how I only wish to help, after all... Mother knows best.
 zoo_queen_mother_epilogue_2_1:0 "Commence Operation (Blank)" 
 zoo_queen_mother_epilogue_2_1_desc:0 "Zongo has been a playground for all these untasteful types for too long. There is no longer any need for scheming or plotting, they will taste my fury and all those who stood beside them will know the weight of betraying our nation."
 zoo_queen_mother_epilogue_3_1:0 "Arrest Faith Leadership"
 zoo_queen_mother_epilogue_3_1_desc:0 "Those ponytarian types always annoyed me to no end, always babbling about meaningless issues instead of keeping in line.

 zoo_queen_mother_epilogue_4_1:0 "Purging The Council"
 zoo_queen_mother_epilogue_4_1_desc:0 "Those council meetings were always a headache with their unceasing bickering and annoyances.

 zoo_queen_mother_epilogue_4_3_desc:0 "Ahh, the Mavelas. Pockets full of money and minds full of exactly the experience I need. While their use of slavery was distasteful, their ranks always knew how to keep themselves around as the flow of history shifted. They shall be a useful ally in the future, in exchange I could even overlook some of their practices."

 zoo_queen_mother_epilogue_6_1_desc:0 "There's no dancing around it, his plans for modernisation have gone too far. Of course, we shall not be going back to our previous ways, it'd be idiotic to throw away the boons of industrialisation, however the funds that once went there shall be much better utilised with army expansion."
 zoo_queen_mother_epilogue_6_2:0 "Securing Our Borders" 
 zoo_queen_mother_epilogue_6_2_desc:0 "Some may whisper that Zongo is overstretched; I counter that the borders remain unacceptably vulnerable. True security lies not in treaties, but in control. By establishing a series of loyal buffer states, we can ensure the kingdom's safety for generations."
 zoo_queen_mother_epilogue_7_1:0 "The Birth of the Zongo National Movement"
 zoo_queen_mother_epilogue_7_1_desc:0 "As a reaction to our glorious expansion, a new generation of proud Zongolese nationalists has organised themselves as a true paramilitary to defend the crown! Now, all they need is some crumbs to stroke their egos and they'll be sure to praise the state and ensure any rabble-rouser remains quiet. I won't even need to get my hooves dirty anymore!"

 zoo_queen_mother_epilogue_8_1_desc:0 "Internal security is truly an important topic for me. Imagine what could happen to the poor foals if left unprotected?!

No need to thank me, I only wish to care for my foals after all."

 zoo_king_epilogue_2_2_desc:0 "Under the guidance of loyal Mani, investigations must be conducted as to the extent of the Queen-Mothers crimes and her collaborators. They must be identified and put on trial in a Special Tribunal empowered by the King to purge the state from her rotten ways."

 zoo_king_epilogue_4_1_desc:0 "The sheer scale of our flaws has been unveiled, yet Akida has never been one to call it quits simply due to hard circumstances! He has called for his closest advisers to formulate a plan to truly rid Zongo of all that once corrupted it. He will have his kingdom back."
 zoo_king_epilogue_5_1:0 "The Constitutional Commission"
 zoo_king_epilogue_5_1_desc:0 "The constitution had many, many unseen flaws. With loopholes and vague entries galore, a commission shall be formed to ensure it is thoroughly revised and rewritten. There shall be no more skirting authority by abusing technicalities; everything shall be very well defined in our new constitution." 
 zoo_king_epilogue_5_2:0 "Reorganising The Budget"
 zoo_king_epilogue_5_2_desc:0 "Akida was blinded by ambition; his dream overtook all else as his subjects suffered without him ever noticing. Anarbek and the intelligentsia have been called upon to ensure the budget is well optimised so they no longer suffer from petty obstacles and mistakes that impeded Zongo's growth."
 zoo_king_epilogue_5_3:0 "Ensure Loyalty Of The Armed Forces"
 zoo_king_epilogue_5_3_desc:0 "'The army follows a strong leader' is something he had heard many times, yet that was simply not true. The army follows those they believe will keep their families fed and healthy. With the successes of the special tribunal, we must now rebuild and ensure the army's trust in the crown to prevent further dissent."
 zoo_king_epilogue_5_4:0 "Restoring Trust With Our Subjects"
 zoo_king_epilogue_5_4_desc:0 "It is fair to say that many of our subjects do not fully believe the hard times are over, especially those who have been victims of war and bloodshed. To ensure our nation does not collapse under its own weight, we shall work to regain their trust in the crown and Zongo."
 zoo_king_epilogue_6_1:0 "Mani's Into Governors"
 zoo_king_epilogue_6_1_desc:0 "A system of chieftains simply cannot work anymore; it is outdated and frankly too unregulated. That does not mean they shall be rid of, that would be too much of a headache. The Manis shall retain their positions, just under a different, more modern light. They shall have new obligations and guidelines to follow as they adapt to their new roles as governors."
 zoo_king_epilogue_6_2:0 "Finishing The Programme" #revise
 zoo_king_epilogue_6_2_desc:0 "The initial plan, while closely arranged, has now been shown to contain certain inefficiencies and flaws that could not be known with theory alone. Akida has set in motion a final phase to amend these inefficiencies and flaws. Once this last phase is completed and the program ended, we shall be able to have a free, self-sustaining market and free up a large part of our budget. A new age has come to Zongo!" 
 zoo_king_epilogue_6_3:0 "Friendship With The Centaurs"
 zoo_king_epilogue_6_3_desc:0 "The Ancient Pact has long been a bastion of stability and progress in the region, their volunteers serving to ensure Zongo could survive the war of the southeast. Akida holds fond memories of his time in Senturya and his occasional visits to Gargiloya. Now, Anarbek has been sent to İlkşehir to propose a formal military alliance, hopefully ensuring peace and closer collaboration well into the future."
 zoo_king_epilogue_7_1:0 "Lifting Up The Downtrodden"
 zoo_king_epilogue_7_1_desc:0 "'The creatures are well fed and well paid.' Such a bold lie. Akida now sees the truth: that his industrial drive left many in poverty, toiling with meagre pay and no prospects. As penance for this grave error, great assets have been mobilised with the assistance of the faith to uplift those left behind and ensure they too may enjoy Zongo's prosperity."
 zoo_king_epilogue_7_2:0 "A Royal Marriage"
 zoo_king_epilogue_7_2_desc:0 "After waiting so long for a moment of stability to fulfill their vows, that time has finally come. With Zongo healing from the errors and subterfuge that had plagued it, there is one event that brings hope to the entire populace. Bells ring across the nation as the country stops to celebrate; Akida and Ayana are getting married!"
 zoo_king_epilogue_8_1:0 "The Magnum Opus"
 zoo_king_epilogue_8_1_desc:0 "The road here has been rough, filled with deceit and suffering. Yet, as trains whistle away and factories rumble, the king seems content with all he has done, looking forward to all that awaits his future alongside his closest friends. They no longer labour only for Akida's dream, but a shared dream: a dream of Zongo."

 zoo_council_epilogue_1_1:0 "A Kingdom On Fire"
 zoo_council_epilogue_1_1_desc:0 "A great tragedy has occurred! With Akida comatose and the Queen-Mother unresponsive, the Bomboko line is leaderless, with no monarch to lead! Someone must step in to ensure the kingdom does not collapse."
 zoo_council_epilogue_2_1:0 "Re-assemble The Council"
 zoo_council_epilogue_2_1_desc:0 "The council was frozen; its petty bickering and frail loyalties contributed to the situation we face today. Yet, this does not mean we must get rid of it. We must reassemble loyal council members who may still be trusted so we can ensure stability."
 zoo_council_epilogue_2_2:0 "Discussions With The Centaur"
 zoo_council_epilogue_2_2_desc:0 "As a leader of the country's Intelligentsia and a good friend of Akida, Anarbek is a very important ally to have on our side during this chaotic time. Ayana will contact the Centaur; she hopes he is willing to stick by Zongo in these trying times."
 zoo_council_epilogue_3_1:0 "A Plan For Stability"
 zoo_council_epilogue_3_1_desc:0 "With the support of the council, the intelligentsia, and the faith, Ayana and Anarbek have drafted a reform plan to ensure the country safely braves these rough times. With Ayana as Queen-Regent and Anarbek as her closest advisor, Zongo will be protected until the crown is ready once more—until Akida awakens!"
 zoo_council_epilogue_4_1:0 "Ayana's Public Works Program"
 zoo_council_epilogue_4_1_desc:0 "Poverty has been a stain that industrialisation only served to worsen, with many of our subjects still toiling away in cruel conditions, barely surviving as the nation marches forward. With the full state apparatus by her side, Ayana shall finally tackle the biggest sin of Zongo."
 zoo_council_epilogue_4_2:0 "Anarbek's Reorganisation Of The Army"
 zoo_council_epilogue_4_2_desc:0 "With the disorder following the assassination attempt, many have shown their loyalties did not lie with the crown. To ensure the army is safe from these elements, Anarbek shall lead a complete reorganisation of the military, ensuring only those who prove both loyalty and skill remain."
 zoo_council_epilogue_5_1:0 "Hear The Petitioners"
 zoo_council_epilogue_5_1_desc:0 "The Royal Petition system is a good foundation, but sadly, it has been mostly forgotten and unused due to Akida's focus on his plan and the Queen-Mother's dismissal of most petitions as 'unimportant' compared to the crown's objectives. If we wish to truly show our subjects we care for them, listening to them is paramount."
 zoo_council_epilogue_5_2:0 "Retirement Age For The Mani's"
 zoo_council_epilogue_5_2_desc:0 "The Mani holding their position for life simply cannot function in the modern age. Like all creatures, they grow old; their minds weaken, and they become less driven by reason and more by whims and honeyed words. To ensure the council always remains a trusty tool for the crown, we shall add a retirement age of 60 to any Mani, with the title being passed to their eldest competent offspring."
 zoo_council_epilogue_5_3:0 "Meritocratic Officer Promotions"
 zoo_council_epilogue_5_3_desc:0 "The Mani holding their position for life is a relic of a bygone era, ill-suited for the demands of today. To ensure the Council is composed of vigorous minds capable of serving the crown effectively, a retirement age of sixty shall be instituted. While many of the current Mani will be hit by this measure, they'll be making way for a new generation to take their place as they 'honourably' retire." 
 zoo_council_epilogue_5_4:0 "Civil Officials In The Council"
 zoo_council_epilogue_5_4_desc:0 "The council had long been home only to the Mani and the Faith. Akida's reforms allowed his Intelligentsia allies to join, but this is still not representative enough. If we truly wish for the council to be a voice to all of Zongo, we must reserve spots for civil representatives."
 zoo_council_epilogue_6_1:0 "The Position Of The Faith"
 zoo_council_epilogue_6_1_desc:0 "With the Arch-Priestess Ayana now crowned Queen-Regent of Zongo, many creatures have begun to wonder whether Zongo would become a theocracy. We must assure them this will not be the case and that the Faith will merely act as guiding values for a new Zongo."
 zoo_council_epilogue_6_2:0 "Reforming The $ZOO_grand_railroad_project$"
 zoo_council_epilogue_6_2_desc:0 "Akida's dream was grand; it truly helped Zongo reach the modern age, yet... it was simply too utopian. With the King in a coma, there is simply no one else who can keep his dream alive as he did. Ayana and Anarbek have agreed to officially restructure its funding into a new Royal Development Board to bring pragmatic oversight to the state's finances and economic direction."
 zoo_council_epilogue_6_3:0 "The Plurality Act"
 zoo_council_epilogue_6_3_desc:0 "With hyenas, griffons, giraffes and even some kirins and other races inhabiting our lands, Zongo now represents much more than just zebras. Anarbek has drafted a Plurality Proclamation to ensure our subjects know that Zongo is not an ethnostate, but a place where anyone from any race can enjoy the same rights and opportunities, as he has."
 zoo_council_epilogue_7_1:0 "What Could Have Been"
 zoo_council_epilogue_7_1_desc:0 "Zongo was robbed of its future when that bullet struck Akida. His dreams, his plans, his hopes... they have fallen into a deep slumber alongside him, unable to be achieved by anyone but himself. Ayana only hopes she can prepare Zongo for when their rightful King returns... someday." 
 zoo_council_epilogue_7_2:0 "What Will Be"
 zoo_council_epilogue_7_2_desc:0 "Even amidst tragedy, time marches on. We have fought to grasp a new future and succeeded as it seemed lost to be lost forever. With all the reforms passed during the regency, it seems there is still hope for Zongo after all."
 zoo_council_epilogue_8_1:0 "A New Constitution"
 zoo_council_epilogue_8_1_desc:0 "While it was already a great step taken by the king, many areas of the constitution are still lacking and do not fit with the new Zongo born from the recent reforms. Work is being done day and night to ensure it is revised and prepared to usher Zongo into a new age."
 zoo_council_epilogue_9_1:0 "The Zongolese Federation"
 zoo_council_epilogue_9_1_desc:0 "It would be a severe misrepresentation to call Zongo merely a kingdom. It has come so far since the fateful tragedy, rising from it stronger than ever before. To better represent all the creatures who now live here, we shall proclaim the Zongolese Federation!"

 ### Ideas ###
 ZOO_regency_1:0 "Regent-mother's Rule"
 ZOO_regency_1_desc:0 "Under the regent-mother's rule, Zongo has maintained a delicate balance between the old ways and the undercurrents of change. The regency period is marked by cautious governance, characterised by a conservative approach to internal affairs and diplomacy. While this has ensured a stable rule, it has also led to a lack of significant progress and innovation."

 ZOO_grand_coronation:0 "Splendorous Coronation"
 ZOO_grand_coronation_desc:0 "The crown saved no expense in the celebrations for the coronation. Grand spectacles from exotic dancers to the elaborate crown jewels were fully on display dazzling all those who were present. For many this is the first time they have seen the young King and this was certainly a grand first impression promising greatness for his reign."

 ZOO_under_chieftains_control:0 "Empowered Local Mani"

 ZOO_weak_constitution:0 "Abolition of Slavery"
 ZOO_weak_constitution_desc:0 "While supreme authority in Zongo lies with the monarchy who is advised by the Royal Council consisting of the clergy and Mani's who act as regional chieftains. The local Mani's are expected to provide law and order to their regional provinces ensuring the basic rights of the Zongolese are protected."
 ZOO_mediocre_constitution:0 "Royal Law Book"
 ZOO_mediocre_constitution_desc:0 "The monarchy has instituted a standardised Royal Law Book ensuring laws are applied fairly and equally throughout the kingdom no matter which Mani reigns locally. The royal council advises the monarch on any laws, or amendments for the Royal Law Book but final authority lies with the monarch."
 ZOO_strong_constitution:0 "Royal Constitution"
 ZOO_strong_constitution_desc:0 "The royal constitution contains the basic laws upon which all of Zongo is built. A law book provides standardised law for all regions while the Mani merely act as ceremonial local rulers and advisors to the monarch through the Royal Council. While the values of the Faith are enshrined into the constitution, all citizens are given freedom of worship."
 ZOO_suspended_constitution:0 "Suspended Royal Constitution"
 ZOO_suspended_constitution_desc:0 "The Queen-Regent has suspended the constitution and Zongo is now ruled through emergency measures. While standardised law remains across the kingdom, this could change at any time now that the Royal Council is powerless and the Queen-Regent acts as the sole absolute ruler of Zongo."
 ZOO_dictatorial_constitution:0 "Reformed Royal Constitution"
 ZOO_dictatorial_constitution_desc:0 "The reformed constitution has seen amendments by the Queen-Regent formalising her absolute unchallenged authority within Zongo. The Mani's are now partially empowered together with a number of key creatures around Zongo into a new oligarchic class while the Faith has been made entirely subordinate to the acting monarch."
 ZOO_broken_constitution:0 "Broken Royal Constitution"
 ZOO_broken_constitution_desc:0 "The royal constitution has been broken, recent events have shown that too much authority lies in the hands of the monarchy and that such authority is open to abuse by a malicious actor. The system of Mani's has proven to be impossible to provide proper oversight for. The constitution must be amended lest we slip into chaos and division."
 ZOO_perfected_constitution:0 "Perfected Royal Constitution"
 ZOO_perfected_constitution_desc:0 "The newly reformed royal constitution has devolved much authority to regional governors and put greater limits on the authority of the monarch and its governors. The powers of the council now lie enshrined into the constitution with an independent judicial providing additional oversight."
 ZOO_collapsed_constitution:0 "Collapsed Royal Constitution"
 ZOO_collapsed_constitution_desc:0 "The royal constitution has utterly collapsed as a consequence of the coup. The loyalty of the Mani lies in question while it has become clear the authority of the monarchy has been greatly abused by the Queen-Mother. If we do not amend the constitution soon, the Zongolese state might collapse upon itself."
 ZOO_federal_constitution:0 "Royal Federal Constitution"
 ZOO_federal_constitution_desc:0 "The newly written royal constitution has turned Zongo into a federal constitutional monarchy providing greater powers to devolved regional governments, independent oversight of a judicial and a promise of the reform of the council into an eventual democratically elected parliament. For now though, both the Queen Ayana and her Prime-minister Anarbek have taken it upon themselves to ensure the rights of every creature is protected and all can benefit from solidarity."

 ZOO_unfinished_modernization:0 "Legacy Of The $ZOO_grand_railroad_project$"
 ZOO_unfinished_modernization_desc:0 "The Queen-Mother has cancelled the $ZOO_grand_railroad_project$ abruptly and instead decided to privatise many of the assets belonging to it and the monarchy in a so called economic shock-therapy claiming it would bring more freedom and opportunity for the populace."
 ZOO_reworked_modernization_program:0 "Royal Development Board"
 ZOO_reworked_modernization_program_desc:0 "The Royal Development Board provides oversight, guidance and subsidies for the Zongolese industrial sector now that the free market reigns in Zongo as our initial plans are unfinishable without the wisdom of Akida. The board does carry with them the experience of the old $ZOO_grand_railroad_project$ allowing for a steady continual growth of our economy."

 ZOO_lack_of_trust:0 "A General Lack Of Trust"
 ZOO_lack_of_trust_desc:0 "With the crimes of the Queen-Mother now revealed. It is clear that many Zebra in Zongo no longer trust us, many who were aggrieved by her actions do not differentiate in their fear between Zongo and her. Efforts must be made to restore their trust in our country."
 ZOO_uncertainty_about_truth_1:0 "An Uncertain Truth"
 ZOO_uncertainty_about_truth_1_desc:0 "Hidden behind a web of intrigue and crime lies an unpleasant truth. Little is known of the extent of the Queen-Mother's crimes but what is clear is that we will find is anything but pleasant and yet we must peel the layers of this onion if we are ever to repent."
 ZOO_uncertainty_about_truth_2:0 "Layers Of Intrigue Revealed"
 ZOO_uncertainty_about_truth_2_desc:0 "Like an onion being peeled layer by layer, slowly the truth of Zongo's foundations are laid bare. Disappearances, corruption and more lie at the heart of the Zongolese monarchy."
 ZOO_uncertainty_about_truth_3:0 "The Depths Of our Flaws Revealed"
 ZOO_uncertainty_about_truth_3_desc:0 "As the onion continues to be peeled, tears will reach the eye of the king as the true extent of the Queen-Mothers crimes have almost entirely been laid to bare. The heart of Zongo has been corrupted, creatures would be right in their mistrust of the state."
 ZOO_uncertainty_about_truth_4:0 "A Truth Revealed"
 ZOO_uncertainty_about_truth_4_desc:0 "From the tears of the king, a new plan shall arise. Zongo shall repent for its flaws and take great actions to right our wrongs. The Queen-Mother's legacy must not be the legacy of Zongo."
 ZOO_queen_mother_loyalists_1:0 "Queen-Mother's Loyalists"
 ZOO_queen_mother_loyalists_1_desc:0 "Corrupt officials, army officers, police and bureaucrats remain in function throughout Zongo. If we are ever to recover from the horrors of the Queen-Mother, her cabal of loyalists must be dealt with."
 ZOO_queen_mother_loyalists_2:0 "Queen-Mother's Loyalists"
 ZOO_queen_mother_loyalists_2_desc:0 "Slowly one-by-one the cabal of corrupt loyalists and opportunists are being replaced by competent honest creatures. While a stain remains on the Zongolese bureaucracy and our efforts are not yet complete, we can be assured that soon all of the state will be purged from the Queen-Mothers rot."

 ZOO_commute_to_work:0 "Public Commuting"
 ZOO_commute_to_work_desc:0 "Prioritising the transport of creatures has greatly aided in making them arrive on-time causing many benefits in the long-term. More reliability of transport, leads to more efficient usage of everyone's time."
 ZOO_increased_freight_trains:0 "Increased Freight Trains"
 ZOO_increased_freight_trains_desc:0 "Prioritising the transport of freight across our vast railway networks has greatly expanded the maximum potential efficiency of our production and refinement processes from raw resource to developed product."

 ZOO_untapped_potential_1:0 "Untapped Potential"
 ZOO_untapped_potential_1_desc:0 "Zongo is a land of untapped riches, both in terms of natural resources and workers potential. However, for the last millenia, these resources have remained largely underexploited. The current approach of economic policy has led to an economic stagnation, with traditional tribal agriculture prevailing over modern economic ventures. The local populace, while resourceful and resilient, lacks access to modern education and healthcare, which impedes the kingdom's overall development. As a result, Zongo stands at a crossroads, rich in potential but constrained by a lack of innovation and modern infrastructure to cross the forests."
 ZOO_untapped_potential_2:0 "Tapped Resources"
 ZOO_untapped_potential_2_desc:0 "Zongo, traditionally a land of untapped riches is slowly starting to make use of these vast resources hiding underneath the forests. New economic policy has encouraged large-scale discovery operations to find any and all veins of useful resources and work has begun on tapping into them. The local populace's resourcefulness and resilient character in these rapid expansion efforts may prove to be of even greater benefit in the future."
 ZOO_untapped_potential_3:0 "Industrial Potential"
 ZOO_untapped_potential_3_desc:0 "As the resources from the Zongo basin are now fully in the process of being extracted, it has become increasingly clear that what Zongo holds is every resource required for an industrial economic miracle. With the populace's great resourcefulness in and resilient character in building within the great forests of the basin, these traits have also transferred to the benefit of industry. Soon we will cross into a truly modern economy, for it is inevitable with the great potential of our lands and its populace."
 ZOO_untapped_potential_4:0 "Industrial Revolution"
 ZOO_untapped_potential_4_desc:0 "Large-scale factory operations now lie interconnected through great railway networks where efficiently resources gathered from the rich lands of Zongo travel by train to the nearest factory park. Here we see the benefits of interconnectivity as described in the &ZOO_grand_railroad_project& take its fullest of effect."

 ZOO_army_reforms_1:0 "Legacy of The Zebluan War"
 ZOO_army_reforms_1_desc:0 "In the year 1000, the Zebluan khan crossed our borders into Ithebra and a brutal war ensued which cost the life of the King Nkosi. Our forces are depleted but experienced yet the recent conflict has shown us that a larger army is needed. Measures must be taken to resolve the situation, replenish our army and modernize its structure into one centralized army."
 ZOO_army_reforms_2:0 "A Revived Royal Guard"
 ZOO_army_reforms_2_desc:0 "Better wages and new training facilities have led many Zongolese to seek a career in the newly revived Royal Guard. We must look onwards into reforming the army structure further and copying what the king has seen in Senturya with a professsional officer corps and a centralized command."
 ZOO_army_reforms_3:0 "The Royal Army"
 ZOO_army_reforms_3_desc:0 "The brand new Royal Army now consists of all guard divisions in Zongo under one centralized command with many Mani serving as higher officers combined with a new class of officers consisting of veterans from the Zebluan war who have studied in our brand new Officer schools for modern military tactics. Many Zebra now relish at the opportunity to join the Royal Army knowing the brightest have a chance to become commissioned officers."
 ZOO_army_reforms_4:0 "Pride In The Royal Army"
 ZOO_army_reforms_4_desc:0 "The institution of the Royal Army is now looked upon with pride by the Zongolese. Armed with ever more modern weapons and regular parades in the streets, many a filly, both poor and rich, grow up with dreams to be like those soldiers protecting Zongo from all threats."
 ZOO_army_reforms_5:0 "A Royal Army Under Suspicion"
 ZOO_army_reforms_5_desc:0 "The loyalty of the Royal Army is no longer assured. Recent events have shown that the true loyalty of the Army cannot be guaranteed without the loyalty of the Mani in command. It would be prudent for the King to take measures ensuring that no matter the personal disloyalty of any council-member, the loyalty of the army must be assured."
 ZOO_army_reforms_6:0 "A Loyal Royal Army"
 ZOO_army_reforms_6_desc:0 "With the success of the special tribunal, many opportunistic and disloyal officers have been removed from their command. The Royal Army now firmly listens to those who pay their wages. They respect strength and we have shown in recent months that the King is the undisputed victor, never again shall their loyalty to the monarchy be in question for they are now truly the Royal Army swearing loyalty above all to the monarchy."
 ZOO_army_reforms_5_council:0 "Divided Army Loyalties"
 ZOO_army_reforms_5_council_desc:0 "The betrayal of the Mani Zuba, field marshal of the Royal army has revealed the division within our armed forces. While the opportunistic Mani's loyalties are in question, the Zebra who rose up the ranks through meritcratic means remained firmly loyal. It would be wise for us to restructure the army ensuring those selected for their skills instead of their birth take primacy in the armed forces."

 zongo.1.t:0 "The Confirmation" #SIREN
 zongo.1.desc:0 "The Ceremony Hall at the University of İlkşehir was packed. It was filled to the brim with centaurs, zebras, and a myriad of other creatures alike. To him, it almost looked like a dress rehearsal for his coronation. He smiled at the thought. Years of study and work had brought him to this moment. Soon, very soon, he would finally put all that learning to good use.\n\n"And for our next recipient," his ears twitched as the Rector began to speak from the stage, "I humbly introduce one of our top students. He who has worked tirelessly for this distinction, and elevated our prestige tenfold: Crown-Prince Akida Bomboko!" At the cue, Akida walked onto the stage with his head held high as the applause washed over him. He stopped in front of the Rector, an aged centaur who looked down at him with pride.\n\n"Prince Bomboko. Your treatise in the employment of railways to allow for rapid modernisation has not gone unnoticed. You have not only enriched this institution, but the sphere of economic theory as a whole. So—" the centaur moved a hand to the podium, where he grasped on to a small, round pin emblazoned with the horned emblem of the university "—it is with great honor that I now grant you the title of Doctor.” He bent down, and the pin was clipped onto the lapel of Akida's suit. "Now, if you would like to say a few words?"\n\nAkida couldn't help himself from grinning. "Why, I would!" he said with a chuckle as he climbed a few steps up to the podium. A sea of faces stretched out before him. "To say that I am immensely honored to receive this distinction would be an understatement. İlkşehir has been nothing but kind to me, and has taught me so much more than I ever thought there was to learn. I will not forget this, and neither will Zongo. I thank you all who have helped me on this journey. Because of you all...""

 zongo.2.desc:0 "The sun set on the cafe. Akida watched the sky turn to red as he fully understood the magnitude of going home. Home. Where he had not set hoof since his father's death. Where his mother ruled in his stead. He was practically a colt when he left, barely able to grapple with his grief. He would return a stallion now. For the first time he began to feel anxious anticipation in how he would be received after so long.\n\n"That frown doesn't suit you very well." Akida took his eyes off the sky and to the zebra in front of him, who smirked back. Zyles was a brilliant stallion who hailed from the other side of the continent. They had been steadfast friends for years. His heart panged. The prince smiled. "I am simply practicing my noble disposition."\n\n"Sure, if looking as if you've just eaten a lemon counts." Zyles picked at his half-finished food. "But I have a feeling His Highness isn't telling me the whole truth."\n\nAkida sighed. "I suppose I am realizing just how much of my life I have spent here. I have walked these streets so long, and made so many memories here, that leaving feels as if I'm leaving home all over again." He smiled sheepishly. "Sounds rather foalish now that I say it out loud, doesn't it?"\n\n"Not at all, friend. I know I'll miss you." Zyles paused in thought, before tapping his hoof on the table. He bent down to his bag, where he took out a small book. "My latest has just been released—fresh off the presses as it were. Take this as a going-away gift. So you don't forget me." He winked. "I wouldn't mind you passing my name around when you've taken the throne, either."\n\nHis face lit up in joy, before smiling softly. "I-I don't know what to say... I'm touched." Akida looked down at the book, and read the title printed in large, glossy letters:"

 zongo.3.desc:0 "Akida's side of the room was empty. Gone were the newspaper clippings and mouth-drawn designs, the books stacked up high like towers, and walls plastered with his personal mementos and gifts from home. Now only a single steamer trunk lying on the floor indicated that he had ever been there at all. Years of his life at the University was piled away, just like that. The road to his brighter future was packed light. Akida slipped on the trunk's harness and made his way for the door. Then, he stopped as he made one last look over. His eyes landed on his roommate's side of the dorm, still full, and onto a blueprint.\n\nIt was a study of an already existing firearm design, one that had once been very popular in the region. Akida remembered the centaur youth talking his ear off about this particular project months ago, and how it was meant to test the designer's fundamentals. He studied the precise lines and clear labels. His own kingdom had little—for now—in the way of a manufacturing base for such things. If there were any firearms within its borders, they certainly weren't Zongolese. With that, an idea began to dawn on him. He would have to bring in specialists into the kingdom as soon as he could. But with these designs, he could lay the groundwork for production as soon as he arrived!\n\nSoon, there was a written note with a hefty bag of coins to weigh it down. Akida set out once more, sliding the folded blueprints into coat as his mind raced with all the things that would come."

 zongo.4.t:0 "The Arrival" #SIREN
 zongo.4.desc:0 "Akida felt his breath hitch as the ship moored to the port of Zamu. Leagues and leagues of low-lying houses expanded outwards, painting the horizon white and gray and brown. As far as he could see every inch of the city teemed with equinity, bright and bustling. Soon, those closest turned their heads to him as the ship properly docked. The prince was finally home.\n\nHe rushed to the gangway, waving as the chatter of the crowd grew. There at the docks was a procession of soldiers. With them, he finally saw her. A finely dressed middle-aged zebra mare. She was in the process of severely dressing down a commander, it seemed. Akida smiled, and he practically pranced on the way down. "Mother!" he called out. "I don't suppose yelling at this poor stallion is part of the welcoming ceremony?"\n\nHer voice cut out abruptly. Her face, twisted in a mean snarl, went blank. "Akida?" she asked. Before he could respond, she galloped forward and crushed him in a hug. "You are finally here, my foal!" When she pulled back, she looked at him with nothing but pure affection. "Never mind all that; how was the trip back? You don't feel sick, do you? Because I swear if you do—" she fussed, but he cut her off: "I promise you, I'm perfectly alright. Enough so to make the way back to the palace, at least."\n\nHis mother nodded. "Of course, of course. We better get a move on, then. You!" She sharply turned to the commander behind her and snapped, "What are you doing, dawdling about—do you expect your future king to carry his own luggage? Move!" There was an explosion of movement then. Without turning back, his mother trotted ahead of him. She looked over her shoulder with a smile, "Come along, Akida. You have a lot to catch up on.""

He just needed a moment to collect himself before crossing that final threshold.\n\nIt was one thing to dream of wielding his father's power. It was another to step into the nitty-gritty of governance. In the room beyond, his council had finally gathered, each with their own agendas, beliefs and loyalties that extended beyond the throne. His dreams of a modern Zongo would have to endure them all. He licked his dry lips, suddenly nervous. Inside, he could hear they were already arguing. It was like hearing the first crash of thunder from an approaching storm.\n\nBut as all as storms do, it passed. When he strode into the room, he looked each one of them in the eye, their bickering ending as all bowed in his honor. These would be the creatures he would deal with for his entire reign: advisors from every walk of life, all seated and waiting for their soon-to-be king. His mother sat beside his chair, an ever-present smile on her face.\n\nWith a final, deep breath, he opened his mouth to address the room."

 zongo.6.t:0 "Homecoming Celebrations" #reminder to rewrite middle paragraph
 zongo.6.desc:0 ""As creatures danced and songs were played, all of the upper echelons of Zongolese society met to welcome back their future king, now finally ready to lead them once more into the fray. In this cheerful ceremony, there was only one creature that stood alone, a cup of cider on his hoof as others danced and socialised around him. It was not that he was being avoided; rather, quite the opposite.\n\n"Prince Akida, I have heard you are still unmarried! You see, I have two beautiful daughters—" 'You honor me, if you'll excuse me.' "Prince Akida, it is a pleasure to make myself acquainted with you, I am —" 'The pleasure is mine, please enjoy the festivities.' "My prince—" 'Thank you, enjoy yourself.' These were the most common words leaving Akida's mouth during this party, interactions being boiled to pleasantries and a swift exit. Now, as he sat in a corner ruminating on how much longer he had to wait, an older zebra approached—one he recognised as a mani from his father's time. Akida prepared for more pleasantries deal with, until... \n\n"You were always a smart one, young Akida. I'm sure you already have many plans for your time as Mwenezongo... I only hope I am able to see them to their conclusion while I still live." The older zebra sat beside him, not looking him in the eye, but far, far away in the skies. Akida smiled and lightly shook the cup. \n\n"You honor me with your words, wise mani, even if I am not still worthy of them." Akida smiled. "I, too, hope to see my plans concluded in your lifetime. It is the unending work of you and all others who assisted my late father to get Zongo to today that has given me a chance to grasp the future." Akida did not look into the skies as the old zebra had; he looked straight ahead. His plans were not day dreams or wishful thinking: they were all grounded in reality.\n\nWithout a single look shared, the two zebras sat beside each other, quietly enjoying the moonlight and festivities in their own way.'"

 zongo.7.t:0 "A Talk with Mother" #SIREN
 zongo.7.desc:0 "The last time Akida had tea with his mother was in Senturya. Officially, it was for a diplomatic visit. Really though, she just used it as an excuse to see him. Even just a year ago their conversation had been light, and he couldn't recall what subjects they discussed. Now, the atmosphere couldn't have been more different. For the first time, they didn't speak as just kin, but as monarchs.\n\n"Zongo has thrived under you," Akida admitted, "but I look around and the kingdom looks exactly as it did the day I left. Truthfully, it has been the same since Father's rule." He smiled lightly, his expression turning to quiet determination. "I believe there needs to be change. Only a great shake-up will wake our kingdom from its stupor. We have the means to completely transform Zongo into something of envy. This cannot be done without your help. I have my vision, but you have the experience and expertise I do not. So..." The prince shifted in his seat. "Would you help me?"\n\nHis mother took a long sip of her tea. Her gaze pierced through him. From the outsider's perspective, he could see why so many found her intimidating. Long past her golden years as she was, she still carried herself with an air of power and dignity that was impossible to ignore. "I can't say I'm enthused." She sighed. "Pretty as it is, your 'vision' of change is sure to bring nothing but trouble. I have run this kingdom the way I have for a reason." Her sharp tone made the prince frown, but she kept on. "But you are king. Your word is all, and not even I am exempt from it. You have my counsel, and I will do everything in my power to ensure that Zongo prospers as we want it to." She smiled sweetly at Akida. "Rest assured, my son, I will be there for you every step of the way.""

Akida's attire was intricate, his golden earrings and colorful clothing a show of Zongo's wealth. As he walked towards the throne, a single mare awaited him beside it.\n\n"It is good to have you here for this, Mother." Akida gave a small bow to his mother. She smiled proudly at her son, her outfit nearly as intricate as his. "I guess this means I'm not a little colt anymore."\n\nHer smile seemed to falter, emotion giving way in her face. "Oh, my little Akida... you are as beautiful as your father! How could you have grown so fast..." She quickly composed herself. "I should not keep you waiting any longer. Do you, Akida Bomboko, promise to be fair and respectful to all your subjects? To honor your ancestors and your duty? To understand how as of today, you live not only for yourself, but as the representative to all of Zongo?"\n\n"I do," he answered in quick succession to each question.\n\n"Very well then. As acting regent, I lay down my position and give way..." As if on command, he lowered his head, his heart pounding with anticipation. "Mwenezongo, King of the Zongolese!" As the crown landed on his head, cheers began to fill the grand hall as every creature erupted in joy. The Queen-Mother had a proud but composed smile. "Long live Zongo! Long live our King! Long live my son!" With cheers growing ever louder, his mother began to guide him out of the hall.\n\nAs they walked outside, a clear path was laid down the middle of the road where an adorned carriage waited. Thousands of zebras lined the sides, all instantly erupting into cheers as he walked out. His heart beat faster than ever before... Was this the feeling of being a king? Of having so many relying upon you? As the crowd cheered, he could only think of their smiling faces as his plan went forward. He had to get it done, not only for himself, but– His mother tugged on him, quietly whispering in his ear. "Remember, try not to break too many hearts at the ceremony, you're too young to be having an heir." As he blushed and they both laughed, Akida felt as a colt for one last time. From then on, he was King."

She had a whole different aura to herself at this moment, her kind smiles and laughs of before gone. Akida did not feel offended; it was a momentous occasion not only for him but for her as well, standing before the kingdom's most important creatures. Akida gave her a smile. "Do not tell anyone, but I'm also a little anxious."\n\nAs if a weight had been lifted off her back, the priestess gave a small smile, unnoticeable to those far away.

His heart beat faster than ever before... Was this the feeling of being a king? Of having so many relying upon you?"

 zongo.9.desc:0 "Akida stood a bit unenthused, his mother serving as a clear contrast to his tired face as she looked through a book of items, showcasing them to the young king.\n\n"Look here, my son! Wouldn't these golden earrings look perfect upon your pretty little face at your coronation?" She made motion as if to pinch his cheeks, but refrained from doing so. "Of course, there's also the matter of the venue... it would bring shame to your late father and yourself if you were to reserve a post-party venue that did not bring out your best traits. Ah!" She looked startled as she flipped through the book. "Of course we can't forget we need more foreign dancers; they are sure to attract the attention of both noble and peasant alike during the ceremony. Do you prefer Senturyan or perhaps something more exotic? I hear Kirian bladedancers are a beauty to behold. The centaurs make for flimsy dancers in my opinion, but considering how you've spent the last few years alongside their kind, maybe it would create a better atmosphere... what do you think?"\n\nAkida seemed as if his head would blow, taking a moment to breathe as his mother finally stopped her onslaught of suggestions and questions. "Dear Mother... I have been trying to say that I wish for none of that. A standard coronation will suffice." His mother kept the same smiling face, changed only by the occasional blink, finally speaking up after a long silence.\n\n"Standard...?" His mother's smile finally faltered for a second. "My son, these are the standard expectations... I have been as frugal as I could! Any cheaper than this and they'll surely call you foul names on the streets such as the "Poor King" or the "Frugal King". I cannot allow them to besmirch my dearest son! Now, be a dear and choose a dancer." As quickly as it had left, her smile had come back, leaving Akida with little choice.\n\nHe couldn't help but think how much this would end up costing from the already very tight budget he had inherited to get his plans started. His mother did have a point. A lavish ceremony was the traditional way to project the power of the Zongolese monarchs, which would surely satisfy and quiet everyone... but something within him kept bugging him about all those wasted funds. Was tradition really that important to the march of progress? With his mothers smile still intact, Akida spoke up."

The kingdom was a treasure trove of potential, and he knew it. He immediately rose to address the delegates and chiefs, the enactors of his will, gathered in the council chamber to hear their role in shaping the kingdom's future. \n\n"Zebras of Zongo, today marks the first step in a long journey to prosperity. As everyone knows, our nation is wealthy beyond comparison, yet our citizens live in huts and toil away with simple sticks and stones. No longer! With the help of specialists from abroad, I have devised a grand plan for the rapid modernisation of Zongo." Akida stated confidently, laying out a map of his proposed rail network for the kingdom. \n\n"I have seen how far other nations have gone, literally and figuratively, when a creature can go from one province to the next in hours, not days, where villages can exchange their precious stones for food and furniture with relative ease, where Zongo's great industry can thrive with the wealth of our land. After all, what use is a fruit or treasure if one cannot reach it?" \n\nThere was some slight hesitation as the council looked at each other before their attention turned to Nzuzi's short cough.

While he was offering considerable pay from the royal treasury, not many could be expected to come work in Zongo. His mind, however, was fixed on one creature.\n\nAs the gangplank lowered, the usual mix of merchants and travellers disembarked. Among them he saw a familiar silhouette from his university days.

"Your letter found me, Your Majesty."\n\n"Please," Akida interjected, his tone soft. "There's no need for such formality here. I would feel embarrassed to see my professor acting as yet another subject."\n\n"I can say the same; please, call me Anarbek." The centaur gave him a smile and a bow. "I hope you understand that my respect for you is not merely one of a subject for his ruler; it was already there in your days as a student. I had hoped to see the grand plans you sketched in my lectures become reality, although I never imagined I would be summoned to help you with them. Once I got your letter I embarked on the first ship I found."\n\n"You are the first to arrive heeding my summons; with luck, you will not be the last. If Zongo is to modernize, it will require more bright minds like yours. No matter how brilliant, one creature alone cannot hope to stand against a millennia of tradition fearful of any change."

"Your father was a great king, and your mother..." His eyes wandered around the room, seemingly as tired as Akida found himself. "...has ensured the throne is safe for your taking. I trust you shall do just as well as they have." He cleared his throat, a nervous, dry sound. "However, these plans of yours are shaking many of the other elder mani in the council. I wish only to warn you to be careful. You walk a dangerous road."\n\n"Indeed, wise mani. You can be certain I do not wish to destroy the authority of the mani or our age-long traditions. I only wish to bring the modernity I saw in the outside world to the Zongolese so all may enjoy the boons I saw shared among the creatures of Senturya," Akida smiled. "If any doubts come or you believe that I have strayed off, you may call out to me so we may resolve it in a timely manner."\n\nAs the mani left with a worried look, Akida's composure faded. This had been the third elder today, each delivering the same vague warnings of 'dissenting voices.' He had expected resistance, but the sheer repetition was draining. None were bold enough to state their grievances directly, only dancing around their issues. At that moment, he missed the directness of his classmates in Senturya. For them, he was not a prince, but a friend. If they were here, perhaps they could—\n\nA knock cut his thoughts short. The door opened to a page announcing the next mani was ready.

"Diverting this much capital and labor to construction will cause shortages. We are projecting a sharp, if temporary, rise in poverty and dissatisfaction from your subjects. The people will feel this long before they see the benefits of your plans."\n\n"If you call my ideas optimistic, yours are too bleak. The topic of poverty has already been talked about with Queen-Mother. She has assured me she will take care of assisting them so we may march forward with the plan." Akida waved a hoof, a confident, almost dismissive gesture. "The Zongolese are more resilient than you think."\n\nWhen the topic was theory, the now-King found himself very confident as he spoke. Some exchanged uneasy glances. Akida's brilliance was undeniable, but his unwavering faith in the theory was a variable they hadn't factored in. After a moment of silence, Anarbek gave a nod, and the other economists followed one by one until the whole room was in agreement. On paper, the plan itself seemed perfect.\n\nIt was the real world that concerned them."

 zongo.14.desc:0 "Akida found himself in a small, dimly lit prayer room. He had been told the Arch-Priestess often prayed here, and he preferred this informal approach to a stuffy, formal meeting. The door opened, but the words died in his throat. The mare who entered was young, perhaps his own age, yet she wore garments way more formal than any Nganga. This was not the Arch-Priestess from his father's time. "You are not Nala. Are you her successor?" he finally asked\n\n"Forgive me for breaking such terrible news, but... Nala has been dead for a few years" the mare said with a gentle yet sad smile. "I had been her assistant while she still lived, yet after she died I found myself quickly annointed as her replacer as Arch-Priestess of Zongo. At the time ofcourse, the position referred to just the city." \n\nShe let out a soft, flustered laugh. "I was shocked. I had served as Nala's assistant while she was living, but I never expected to be thrust to the spotlight like this. I have done my best ever since, yet... oh! Forgive me." She giggled. "I've been rambling and forgot to ask your name."\n\n"Akida Bomboko."\n\nThe mare blinked, her expression mirroring his own initial surprise. He laughed warmly. "I assumed you knew. My apologies for not introducing myself sooner; I didn't wish to interrupt your story."\n\nA deep blush spread across her face. "By the gods, I've been babbling to the future king as if he were a common foal! Forgive my insolence!" She seemed on the verge of tears as Akida gently assured her it was perfectly fine. "Allow me to properly introduce myself," she said, composing herself. "My name is Ayana, Nganga-Kulu of Zongo. I hope we can work together for our future."\n\nShe smiled again as she bowed—a smile that could brighten the rainiest of days. Akida thought to himself that maybe working with the faith would not prove as tedious as he had feared."

It had been over a week since Zeera had left, and the silence from the authorities had been as complicit as the Mani's crimes. He had taken as many painkillers as he could just to get here, but he would wait no longer for a kingdom that refused to act.\n\nMarching inside, he witnessed a scene of belated justice. Royal guards stood idle, their presence an admission of failure.

He had marched day and night without sleep, but he could not be faster than destruction. Now, as he wandered the husk of his city, he was denied even the final mercy of finding the bodies of his comrades. All but the sturdiest of buildings had been disintegrated in the blast from the Tiger's final roar—a divine punishment upon his people for their failure, and a personal punishment upon him for his absence.\n\nBut even that divine punishment had proven fleeting. No, Dalisay was still being punished now. His rage was not for the Tiger, whom they had failed. It was not for his comrades, who had died with honor. It was not even for himself or the enemy who had wrought this.\n\nIt was for the iron beasts now subjecting his land to its final mockery. As the Zongolese railways advanced, their steam whistles screamed unbothered by the sacred land they desecrated or the graves of his people they built over. They were not just conquerors; they were architects of forgetting, hammering their tracks into the sacred earth, ensuring that not even the memory of what was here could remain undisturbed.\n\nHe could not cry or scream. All he could do was watch as he lost all he once knew as home."

It meant disrespect to one's family and even the spirits... But Dimasupil was gone now. So was the great spirit. Masikap's family was all that remained from these horrible times.\n\nBut how long could they remain safe? With the Zongolese taking charge, working merely to survive was no longer an option. Now you had to earn 'money' to 'buy' things and even pay 'taxes' on them. Masikap was accustomed to foraging for what was needed and trading for some extra goods when he could, but now they had to integrate into what seemed to be a whole different world.\n\nHis mother was sick, his father had been crippled protecting their lands, and his two little siblings were still foals. As the strongest and oldest of the siblings, Masikap was the one who had to provide. He had been offered work down south to help reconstruct the Golden City after the destruction from the Thunder Tiger's roar. This was the best opportunity he had found, so he planned to march there. However, he was told he had to arrive in two days for the offer to stand. It was an impossible journey, unless... he boarded one of their trains.\n\nMasikap truly was scared, to do this was to go against everything he had been taught... to refuse meant giving up on his family, and that was something he refused to do. He finally extended a leg and brought himself inside the iron beast."

From its carriages emerged a stream of zebras—thin, wide-eyed, and clutching meager bundles. More were coming south now, Zongolese, Maglibing and other tribes from all around. Not with weapons, but with tools, seeking opportunity in the skeleton of the Golden City.\n\nHe hadn't seen movement like this in the city since before the Roar. Frankly, even then, it had never been this crowded, not with this constant stream of workers flowing in and out. The Kompel came as pillagers. The Zongolese came as a cataclysm. But this? This was a quiet migration, a current of life flowing back into a land he thought had died. It was a strange sight, and it felt... fragile.\n\nHis gaze drifted over the crowd, settling almost without intent on a young stallion. He moved with determination, yet with clear anxiety. His eyes scanned the chaotic site not with fear, but with a fierce, focused need. He marched as if he carried the world on his back, his body clearly crying for rest, his eyes tired and scared. Everything about this stallion seemed like a walking contradiction... and yet, he was here. Looking for work like all the others. Looking to rebuild what was lost. Looking just to... live.\n\nAs the crowd walked into the city, Dalisay felt an old, almost forgotten feeling, something he expected to never feel again. It wasn't joy, but the absence of a certain despair. The Zongolese may have been the reason the city was destroyed... but they have not let it remain in ruins. Foals now studied under Zongolese priests, creatures sought aid from doctors instead of shamans, and all worked no longer for simple subsistence, but to find their place within a new system. The Golden City was not healing. It could never heal from what had happened—but it was, unmistakably, continuing. And for now, that was enough."

Make the jungle submit to modernity, whatever the cost. She had attempted stronger saws, hotter fires, and more powerful chemicals, yet the jungle swallowed every effort, its magical regrowth making a mockery of their progress. They were fighting the land itself, and losing badly.\n\nExhaustion finally claimed her as she laid back in her chair. She stopped trying to cut and simply observed the nature outside. She watched how the vines served as a reinforced ceiling for the jungle's creatures, how the root systems created a natural foundation more stable than any concrete pilings.. her eyes went wide with recognition as she finally understood. This didn't feel like an "I got it!" moment, but a surrender to the obvious she had tried to ignore in favor of more traditional methods. She wasn't looking at an obstacle; she was looking at a partner.\n\nScrambling for a fresh sheet of parchment, her quill flew. The plan was no longer to conquer, but to integrate. They would use the living wood as natural support beams for structures, follow the rivers as a safe spot and utilise whatever other mechanism the jungle used to protect itself as a way to assist modernity. They could protect the land's heart while still laying rails and raising buildings. It wasn't a compromise, she told herself; it was a superior form of engineering!\n\nShe went to reach for a cigarette to congratulate a job well done, but stopped as a cut vine on the table seemed as if glaring at her.

Now it was Masikap that pulled on him, as they went further inside.\n\nAs the train pulled away, Dalisay expected to feel a jarring violence, the land screaming as it was carved. Instead, he felt only a smooth, powerful glide. He watched the world stream past the window, a testament to a new era. Jungle and city were no longer at war; Zongo's authority flowed alongside the landscape. Gleaming buildings of polished stone and living wood stood where tribal camps once were, all connected by this pulsating network of rails. This was not the conquest he had witnessed, nor the cataclysm he had survived. This was the "continuing" he had observed, now matured into something profound.\n\nThe Zongolese had not tamed the land, nor had they destroyed it. They had listened to it.

 zongo_railway.41.desc:0 "Geerhard Goedsmaak looked at the smouldering crater in the factory. So much precious beer, seeping away into the ground! And it was good beer, Feathisian beer, true to the recipe of his great-grandfather, who had come here from Mirabelle to Muromo Werwizi. Some said the griffons here were only fighters, mercenaries, or adventurers, but this was not true for his great-grandfather. According to his family's tales, Adrianus Goedsmaak had been a jovial griffon, a bit on the rounder side as well, like a good brewer should be. His family had also always been good friends with the local zebras, which was perhaps the reason why it had never grown particularly large...\n\nBut "Goedsmaak's Beer Feathisian style" was a well-known brand throughout Imba-Zaru – not that there were many brewers here anyway –, and it came with a promise of quality: only barley, hops, and water were used during the brewing process, and the yeast was the same good Feathisian yeast his great-grandfather had once brought from Feathisia. Geerhard was now leading the family business in the fourth generation, since the death of his mother in 985, and he had expanded the business markedly by building the new factory in the 990s.\n\nBut then, in 1006, the stupid Roamans came under their pretentious "Kaiser". His factory had been hit by an artillery strike, costing him much time and money to have it rebuilt. And now, the Zongolese had come and another artillery strike had hit the factory! The precious beer! And how much gold it would cost to get it repaired again! But, most importantly of all, hopefully he could recover enough yeast... the stockpile had not quite recovered yet. He should have grown more, had gotten too greedy... He lashed out with his tail. The profits of this year had already seeped away, at the very least."

 zongo_railway.42.desc:0 "The construction noise filled the air with a constant humming. Geerhard Goedsmaak was hovering over the factory with the construction plans in his claws, yelling commands to the workers below. It was quite taxing for him to fly for so long every day – particularly because he wasn't the most slender of griffs – but it made supervising the rebuilding process much more efficient. Good progress was made every day, and soon enough the beer would flow again.\n\nA while later, the workers had gone for lunch, and Geerhard was in his office reviewing his business plans. The last year had been a total loss, and the family fortune had shrunk significantly. The Zongolese attack had been the last thing he needed, particularly after the damage already caused by the war with Roam. But he was not yet losing his optimism. The first rule for any businessgriff was always to look for opportunities. Flexibility, speed, and precision, these were the most important traits for a griffon in his position. And as luck would have it, there was exactly such an opportunity.\n\nFor all the damage the Zongolese did, they also brought positive developments. In particular, their king seemed to be obsessed with trains, and consequently, they had built a massive railway network all over their ever-expanding empire. Of course, trains hadn't been exactly new to Chisimbi –in sharp contrast to Zongo, Geerhard figured – but the result was all the same: transporting goods had become cheaper. Much cheaper, in fact.\n\nWhen the factory reopened – something only weeks away – he would focus on spreading his brand beyond the borders of Imba-Zaru. Surely the Zongolese had never tasted good, Feathisian beer before, if they even knew beer at all. He had already started to make contacts with key figures in charge of overseeing railroad transports. If he could get the transport costs just a little cheaper still, and maybe bring some officials to promote his beer, there was money to be made. He grinned. A lot of money."

 zongo_railway.43.desc:0 ""And that, my son, is what I like to call a big pile of money." The eyes of Geerhard Goedsmaak and his son Hendrik focused on a rather large bag of gold coins. Sometimes, a griffon just needed to let the gold run through his claws, and so Geerhard had decided to take the latest quarterly profits of his beer factory home in their physical form.\n\nAs he observed his son rummaging through the gold, he contemplated the newest developments. The repairs on the factory had now been completed for a while, and production was humming. In fact, there was construction work going on at the factory again, but this time it was to make room for even more mash tuns, coppers and fermenters. When the expansion was complete, his factory would have almost double the output.\n\nHe was also very happy that he could hire back many of the griffons and zebras he had to lay off when the factory was damaged. Some of them had been friends, and so his economic calamity had also turned into a personal loss. Now, as things were looking up again, this trend had reversed quickly, and when he wandered through the factory, he could hear their happy greetings. In fact, production had picked up so much that he now had more employees than ever before, which filled him with great pride.\n\nExports of his beer to other parts of the expanding Zongolese realm had become a huge success. Many zebras, especially in the south, had never tasted good Feathisian beer, or any beer at all. It was less intense than the alcoholic drinks they knew, and you could have a glass or two without ruining your evening. Consequently, demand had been great, and profits had soon followed.\n\nAnd the best thing was that the Zongolese were continuing to build up the railway network. Geerhard had made crucial contacts within their administration, and had secured ample transport capacity from their latest expansion. While it had cost him some of his hard-earned money, as soon as the new capacity went online, it would pay off a thousandfold."

But why would you go out with a Zongolese, a Zongolese soldier no less, rather than some nice Imba-Zarunite mare? Have they not conquered and subjugated us? Where is your pride, Hendrik?"\n\nHis son looked confused before bursting out laughing.\n\n"Really, Father? You of all people are complaining that the Zongolese conquered and subjugated us? Look around you! These piles of gold coins don't come from nothing; they come from our beer being exported into every corner of Zongo through the rail network they built. Our business has quadrupled since they came and 'subjugated' us. You yourself said more than once that their conquest has been a gift from the gods, and now you're suddenly discovering your patriotism? Please, that is ridiculous."\n\nThe older griff breathed heavily. "I think there is quite the difference between a business contract and a relationship. I... I would have never..." He paused for a moment, being lost for words. "Fine, I'll admit it, we have profited greatly from the circumstances. But that doesn't mean I consider myself Zongolese! That is... I mean...

And what was he to make of the situation?\n\nLast week, his son Hendrik had married Niya, a soldier mare from the densest of Zongolese forests, who had been stationed in Imba-Zaru as part of the garrison. The marriage had certainly come as a shock to her family as well, and he could see a sombre look in the eyes of Niya's mother as she realised Niya would never bear foals. His family, griffons living among zebras for centuries, was more used to this aspect...\n\nBut overall, Niya's family had been very nice, and they shared many stories. Strange, how Zongo had been so close and yet so far. With the new trains, the journey between the two homes barely lasted a day, and Hendrik and Niya had already decided they wanted to maintain two households. How close everything suddenly was...\n\nYet, there was also another aspect. Niya had at some point said during the ceremony that 'at the end we are all Zongolese'. Was that true? As for himself, Geerhard had already decided that he would never consider himself Zongolese. But for his son, he wasn't so sure. Hendrik had never shown any hesitation when interacting with the conquerors. Perhaps his view was outdated...\n\nAt least the business was unequivocally doing well. Profits had risen again last quarter, as had production. New factories were planned in Roam and Zongo City, and exports now also reached far beyond just the kingdom's borders. For some reason, he could feel his great-grandfather Adrianus smiling upon him.

"More importantly than that... how can we use this to our advantage?"\n\nMazut swallowed his food and opened his mouth to speak.\n\n"Exclusive contracts," Ozuvu interjected with a confident smile. "That's the answer. We use our positions to secure the supply contracts for the railway construction—lumber, provisions, labour. We become indispensable to their efforts."\n\nSaadi chuckled. "A closed loop, as economics should be. Zongo builds its prosperity, and we build ours right alongside it, funded by their treasury." She turned to Mazut, who was munching on some saltine crackers. "You can draft the initial proposals, right? All three of us stand to gain immensely."\n\nMazut paused, a cracker hovering at his mouth, and lowered it with a sigh."

I mostly avoided parties during my time at university; I did not expect they would catch up to me after becoming king. Perhaps I should have practiced a bit more in Senturya." The two shared a laugh as a comfortable silence fell between them, watching the other zebras dance. As a new song began, Akida extended his hoof.

The representatives of the five Imba-Zaru houses wore their business smiles as they bowed to the envoy of Zongo. Normally, it would be natural for them to hold grievances against their conquerors. In truth, the more traditional houses did harbour deep resentment, yet none dared to voice it. The exclusion of the sixth house from this meeting had been warning enough. They had lost, and now they had to adapt.\n\n"I'm glad Imba-Zaru has such enlightened zebras as yourselves," the Zongolese diplomat said with a broad smile. He had pushed and pulled the five houses through relentless negotiations, wearing them down to simple terms that effectively integrated their political structure into Zongo. A more than satisfactory outcome. "The Queen-Mother and the King will be most pleased with this resolution. As everyone is aware, we desire stability in the region."\n\nThe house representatives nodded, some in acceptance, others in delight. The deal elevated them to local Mani, granting influence over the region and positions within the Zongolese court. They might have a ruler above them now, but they retained much of their authority and could reap the benefits of being part of a larger, industrialising nation. It was simply a step back to take two forward.\n\nThere were finer details to discuss, but those could be left to their subordinates. For now, they clinked their glasses and traded polite words. They idly wondered how to hint they wished to create ties with the Queen-Mother. She seemed like-minded in the needs of aristocracy."

 zongo_council_epilogue.12.desc:0 "Prompt: Anarbek gives a speech about the proclamation of Zongo as a true constitutional monarchy, with Ayana as the monarch and him as the prime minister. He mostly talks about all their accomplishments during this time (and also the accomplishments of Akida) and how he plans on creating a fairer Zongo where no one needs to suffer anymore. As everyone cheers for him, he thinks about how much this small nation has grown and modernised these last few years, proud to have gotten on that boat to help his student."

 zongo_council_epilogue.13.desc:0 "Prompt: Ayana is keeping company to Akida as they listen to Anarbek's speech on the radio. They share a quiet moment together in each other's embrace as they listen. Akida tells her how proud he is to see his teacher do so much for them, as she tells him she's also glad to be able to spend more time with him now. As their conversation passes, eventually Anarbek comes to the room as the two stand confused to how fast he came. He exclaims that the important part was done, any parties can be for later. Right now, he's exactly where he wants to be, though he does poke at them asking if he should leave to have their private moment. The three of them share a laugh as the player is thanked for playing."

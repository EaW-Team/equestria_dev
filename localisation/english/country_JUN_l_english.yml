JUN_selling_luxury_goods:0 "The Riches of Aztlan"
JUN_selling_luxury_goods_desc:0 "The jungles hold many riches, such as priceless artifacts and mineral veins, and war is a very costly affair. The natives won't appreciate being exploited as such, but they will understand the necessity."
JUN_food_surplus_idea:0 "Food Surplus"
JUN_food_surplus_idea_desc:0 "A well-fed pony is a happy pony - and far more eager to continue fighting, living and reproducing."
JUN_bury_them_here_idea:0 "Masters Of The Jungle"
JUN_bury_them_here_idea_desc:0 "The natives' understanding of the jungle and its secrets gives us a significant edge compared to the "tourists" that are invading it."
JUN_the_final_push_idea:0 "The Fight For Aztlan"
JUN_the_final_push_idea_desc:0 "The jungles belong to the natives! Neither uncaring deities nor maniacal revolutionaries can have them! Push them out!"
JUN_codetalkers_idea:0 "The Huallauhatlatollamini"
JUN_codetalkers_idea_desc:0 "The dialects of the native jungle ponies are numerous and often incomprehensible. It makes for a perfect cypher."
JUN_codetalkers_idea_lar:0 "The Huallauhatlatollamini"
JUN_codetalkers_idea_lar_desc:0 "The dialects of the native jungle ponies are numerous and often incomprehensible. It makes for a perfect cypher."
JUN_army_of_aztlan_idea:0 "Protectors of Aztlan"
JUN_army_of_aztlan_idea_desc:0 "The ponies of Aztlan stand proudly in the defence of their homes."
JUN_night_fliers_idea:0 "Night Fliers"
JUN_night_fliers_idea_desc:0 "It is a risky endeavour to fly during the night, but many natives are quite used to the dark, and navigate through it with ease. Their performance is rather impressive."
JUN_expert_fliers_idea:0 "The Sons Of Quetzalcoatl"
JUN_expert_fliers_idea_desc:0 "The winds are ever favoured for the followers of Quetzalcoatl. They fly higher and better compared to the rest, although it is hard to say if it's genuine skill or suicidal overconfidence."
JUN_admirality_idea:0 "The Aztlan Admiralty"
JUN_admirality_idea_desc:0 "The newly formed Admiralty handles all the matters of the sea, and provides crucial funding for the development of new seafaring vessels."
JUN_lunar_remnants:0 "Lunar Remnants"
JUN_lunar_remnants_desc:0 "We have defeated them, the Nightmare Moon supporters. Yet, even in defeat, they lurk about in the dark, unwilling to accept defeat. We'll need to take steps to reconcile ourselves with the bat ponies and repress those who won't give up violence."
JUN_discontent_in_cities:0 "Discontent In The Cities"
JUN_discontent_in_cities_desc:0 "The civil war may have ended, but the animosity between common ponies has not waned in the slightest. Addressing this issue should be one of our first concerns, lest we suffer a second revolt."
JUN_economic_backwater:0 "Economic Undevelopment"
JUN_economic_backwater_desc:0 "The Equestrian southeast was already amongst the least developed regions in Equestria, but the civil war has ruined what little industry that already existed. The ruling government must enact quick measures to restore civilisation and modernity."
JUN_economic_backwater_2:0 "Economic Undevelopment"
JUN_economic_backwater_2_desc:0 "The Equestrian southeast was already amongst the least developed regions in Equestria, but the civil war has ruined what little industry that already existed. The ruling government must enact quick measures to restore civilisation and modernity. Recent development has alleviated this problem to some extent, however."
JUN_stableside_primacy_idea:0 "Stableside Primacy"
JUN_stableside_primacy_idea_desc:0 "Our development focus has become the rich port city of Stableside, the gateway to Zebrica and many islands which produce lucrative crops. It is also a good location to centralise our arms import programs, as well."
JUN_tourism_idea:0 "The Aztlan Tourism Industry"
JUN_tourism_idea_desc:0 "With peace reigning once more, Dr. Caballeron has enacted one of his ideas to establish tourist destinations both on the shores and in the jungles of Aztlan. As long as any visitors do not mind the heat, they'll be having the time of their lives! The natives, however, do not appreciate being gawked at, nor having their culture misappropriated."
JUN_tourism_2_idea:0 "The Aztlan Tourism Industry"
JUN_tourism_2_idea_desc:0 ""Come see the wonders of Aztlan! Have the time of your lives!\n\n(please do not agitate the native ponies)""
JUN_technochitlan_primacy_idea:0 "Tenochtitlan Primacy"
JUN_technochitlan_primacy_idea_desc:0 "Our development focus has remained on the once ruined city of Tenochtitlan, which will be rebuilt to its former glory. Many ponies will be most pleased to make their living here."
JUN_baltimare_technical_institute_idea:0 "Baltimare Technical Institute"
JUN_baltimare_technical_institute_idea_desc:0 "The Baltimare University has been repurposed and turned into an institute dedicated to all branches of engineering and hard science, filled with many brilliant ponies who are creating future in their hooves."
JUN_baltimare_primacy_idea:0 "Baltimare Primacy"
JUN_baltimare_primacy_idea_desc:0 "Our development focus has become the industrial city of Baltimare, which was relatively preserved during the many battles of the civil war. The machinery present there will allow us to copy their designs and implement them to other cities across the southeast, so that everypony can enjoy modernity."
JUN_peace_in_our_time_idea:0 "The Southern Beacon"
JUN_peace_in_our_time_idea_desc:0 "Despite many difficulties and setbacks, Dr. Caballeron has fulfilled his visioned and brought lasting peace and stability to southeastern Equestria. Ponies, thestrals and natives now live in harmony together, and remark that life has never been better than now."
JUN_discontent_in_cities_2:0 "Discontent In The Cities"
JUN_discontent_in_cities_2_desc:0 "The civil war may have ended, but the animosity between common ponies has not waned in the slightest. Addressing this issue should be one of our first concerns, lest we suffer a second revolt."

### Focuses ###
JUN_decleration:0 "Stuck in a Strange Land"
JUN_decleration_desc:0 "Due to unforeseen circumstances it seems that we are in fact stuck running a country, in the middle of a jungle filled with dangerous fauna, flora, tribals, crazy cultists and annoying adventurers... but if we play our cards right perhaps we can still turn a profit here."
JUN_we_need_a_port:0 "Repurpose Saltmane"
JUN_we_need_a_port_desc:0 "Saltmane Coast is a splendid territory, but we require more than simple jungles and beaches for our war efforts. We shall turn this area into our primary port, to protect ourselves from sea threats as well."
JUN_we_need_the_guns:0 "Call In A Few Favours"
JUN_we_need_the_guns_desc:0 "The instability we face is not one to be taken lightly. Our assets are low, our stance, feeble. However, it will soon change. The means of combat is a small favour to ask in order to achieve control. There's no profit to be made if we can't even defend ourselves."
JUN_we_need_even_more:0 "And Then Some"
JUN_we_need_even_more_desc:0 "The dangers are always afoot, if we intend to stand a chance, more weapons are required. It's time we further increase our stockpile of armaments. Guns, grenades, ammunition, anything a soldier can need."
JUN_the_wealth_of_the_jungle:0 "The Riches of Aztlan"
JUN_the_wealth_of_the_jungle_desc:0 "This land is rich with goods and treasures, we need only be able to excavate them. I, Caballeron, demand quarries to be developed, lands will be razed and trees to be cut, the resources are everywhere, and they will be ours."
JUN_dedicated_smugglers:0 "Blockade Runners"
JUN_dedicated_smugglers_desc:0 "They think they can contain us in here, limit our income. This territory is ours now, and we'll use it to our advantage. Let's show them who controls these jungles, and who can smuggle through them better."
JUN_fortify_technochitlan:0 "Rebuild The Walls Of Tenochtitlan"
JUN_fortify_technochitlan_desc:0 "Tenochtitlan was once a fortress, an impenetrable bastion with great walls which none could surmount. We must rebuild them, that will provide us with a strategic standpoint and a defensive position, should such need arise. And perhaps, the locals will feel more accepting of our presence here."
JUN_reuse_the_ruins:0 "Repurpose the Ruins"
JUN_reuse_the_ruins_desc:0 "The Ruins here are old, crumbling, but they can still provide a solid foundation. We shall repurpose them for our own needs, build our structures upon the ancient land, there will be a stronghold raised here in no time, such is my will."
JUN_repair_the_cannals:0 "Repair The Canals"
JUN_repair_the_cannals_desc:0 "Rivers are a fickle landmark, wild and unpredictable, but if we can tame it, it will become our advantage. Repair the old canals, so that the water will provide us with resources, the river will become our line of transport and the shores will be our enemies' nightmare."
JUN_food_surplus:0 "Stock The Pantries"
JUN_food_surplus_desc:0 "Our supplies come steadily and surely, it is time to replenish our stocks. Load the pantries, let none of our supplies perish, or worse, get into our enemies' clutches. There will always be a good use for it later, our ponies will need it."
JUN_the_old_road:0 "Repair The Ohtli System"
JUN_the_old_road_desc:0 "So many things in here are still in half-decent state. They may not be of good use right now, but if we are to invest into renovations of these roads and structures, our infrastructure will flourish, just as these jungles do."
JUN_secondary_forts:0 "Raise The Towers"
JUN_secondary_forts_desc:0 "With all the elements I put in place, we're still exposed and scattered among these woods. Raise the towers! Our sight will span far and wide, none shall take us by surprise! These fortified constructions will bestow upon us a gratifying sense of security."
JUN_repair_the_temple:0 "Repair the Tonaltzintli Pyramid"
JUN_repair_the_temple_desc:0 "The culture and architecture of these locals is fascinating, the Tonaltzintli Pyramid is a prime example of an excellent edifice of the Neighua tribe. Though turned to a decrepit state with time, this temple may return to its former glory yet. May it inspire us well and provide refuge from the raging war. My only hope is that the chiefs can share my enthusiasm."
JUN_basic_manufacturies:0 "Tenochtitlan Manufacturies"
JUN_basic_manufacturies_desc:0 "With all the progress I've made to develop the framework here, the time has come to move to the next level. Our capital requires better factories, better production. We can finally set up a progressive manufacturing base here, the likes of which this land has not yet seen before."
JUN_basic_saw_mills:0 "Logging Camps"
JUN_basic_saw_mills_desc:0 "The jungles have no shortage of wood. Yet to harvest it more effectively, we need better tools and groundwork to support such activities. Build more sawmills, our logging camps will yield materials to the brim, we shall never run out of fine wood again."
JUN_win_them_over:0 "Meet With The Natives"
JUN_win_them_over_desc:0 "Perhaps these locals can be of use to us. After all, they're the natives here, it would be foolish to fight against them and not alongside them. We must organise a meeting, I know a way into their heart, there is a chance that they will listen to me."
JUN_hearts_and_minds:0 "Hearts And Minds"
JUN_hearts_and_minds_desc:0 "We must further our relationship with the Neighua. A fight for survival can unite anyone, and this is our chance. They may be dangerous, but if we sway them to our side, our cause, the dangers they present can become our tactical advantage."
JUN_borne_of_the_jungle:0 "Borne Of The Dark"
JUN_borne_of_the_jungle_desc:0 "With our agreements in place, our newfound allies entrusted us some of their best and most trained warriors. It is a great honour, and an opportunity that we must cherish. I welcome them, our partners will thrive, and our enemies will learn to fear these jungles."
JUN_bury_them_here:0 "Masters Of The Jungle"
JUN_bury_them_here_desc:0 "Our partnership allowed us to learn these territories in their greatest details. Every nook and cranny that these locals have lived among for ages, their secrets, are now part of our intelligence. Ultimately, it seems this ally has become our greatest asset yet."
JUN_the_chosen:0 "Chosen By The Gods"
JUN_the_chosen_desc:0 "Their culture is a curious one. Odd, but has its uses, perhaps I underestimated them. They wish to offer us to be chosen by the Gods. Such tales are quaint, but the ferocity and cunning of these ponies is undeniable. We shall take them on their offer, it is bound to help our relationship in the future."
JUN_the_final_push:0 "Fight For Aztlan"
JUN_the_final_push_desc:0 "After all we've gone through, I never gave up, we never gave up, and never will. These jungles were a dangerous place, full of perils on every step. They still are, but thanks to our allies, it is only our enemies that see them as such. The Neighua and their culture, their knowledge, is part of our own now. We are free, and this is our land now, we will fight for it as if it were our own. Now, we are home. For Aztlan!"

JUN_army_debate:0 "The Milchimalli"
JUN_army_debate_desc:0 "At last Aztlan is free from Equestrian imperialism but it would be foolish for us to expect it to stand forever out of sheer international goodwill. To make sure our independence isn't snuffed out like so many others in history, we will need to build a military. I'll make sure that anypony entering this jungle with hostile intentions will never come out of it."
JUN_equestrian_tactics:0 "Lessons From The Equestrians"
JUN_equestrian_tactics_desc:0 "Aztlan has freed itself from the Equestrian yoke. But despite our success, we remain woefully behind in terms of pony warfare and much of it comes either from ancestral and obsolete traditions or from adventurers. If we are to truly build an army, we need to study military theory and tactics. And the easiest one to learn from is the Equestrian doctrine."
JUN_trucks:0 "Adopt the Jackalope"
JUN_trucks_desc:0 "Logistics have been one of the most important aspect of warfare throughout history and one the native tribes have been truly apt at. However, modern warfare poses challenges that are simply impossible to overcome with our traditions. Our engineers have repurposed some Sicameonese all-terrain trucks to be jungle-ready, calling it the Jackalope. Let's adopt it to bolster our supply lines."
JUN_new_rifles:0 "Standardise Rifle Models"
JUN_new_rifles_desc:0 "Our soldiers use a variety of weapons acquired through all kinds of ways since the early days of the independence war. This has produced a logistical nightmare for our forces. We need to standardise our guns as soon as possible. If we fail to do so, whole divisions may be stuck on the frontline without ammunition or working rifle to fire at the enemy."
JUN_sturdy_shovels:0 "Dedicated Support Squads"
JUN_sturdy_shovels_desc:0 "Jungle warfare is a deeply complex affair, one where fortification can be a tremendous asset in combat but one that is strategically difficult to use. However, our military staff has combined experience from our native tribes and the various adventurers I brought in. Together, they have designed a doctrine for a mobile Engineer Corps, able to provide infrastructure and fortification in a moment's notice."
JUN_light_tanks_f:0 "The Chimalli"
JUN_light_tanks_f_desc:0 "Our jungles are a terrain hostile to mobile warfare but through careful adaptation of imported tankette, we have learned ways to use mechanized vehicles in them. The result of these experiments is the newly designed Chimalli light tank, a small but highly sturdy tank. There still won't be glorious mechanized charges through the trees but surgical use of the Chimalli will prove devastating on the battlefield."
JUN_new_artillery:0 "Aztlan Artillery Corps"
JUN_new_artillery_desc:0 "Anypony who has ever fought in a jungle knows how devastating and confusing a well-placed shell can be. But any artillery officer who has fought in a jungle can tell you how difficult it is to maintain proper artillery in that kind of terrain, let alone moving it around effectively. But it will be well worth the effort, if only to have the Equestrians and foreigners get a taste of their own medicine."
JUN_new_officers:0 "Scour The Jungles For Talent"
JUN_new_officers_desc:0 "Despite our recruitment binge since the independence, our military staff is still severely lacking. I'll send headhunters throughout the jungles to seek talent among the native tribes and equestrian frontier settlements. They are bound to find tactically minded ponies fit for leadership."
JUN_train_them:0 "Put Them Through Tartarus"
JUN_train_them_desc:0 "Some nations have the luxury to build up slowly. We do not. Aztlan's birth was a painful and bloody affair. What I need are warriors that can take on any threat in a moment's notice. For this purpose, we will put our recruits through the most gruesome of training regiment. Those who will come out of the jungle after it will be formidable warriors. The others will have done their duty."
JUN_adapt_to_the_jungle:0 "Born Out Of The Jungle"
JUN_adapt_to_the_jungle_desc:0 "While a great deal of our soldiers are of Neighua heritage and know how to live in a jungle environment, many of our recruits do not, especially those coming from the coastal cities of Aztlan. To remedy this, a special training program has been instituted to send recruits deep into the Aztlan interior under native and veterans leadership to learn how to survive, move and fight in the jungle."
JUN_sapper_tactics:0 "Sapper Tactics"
JUN_sapper_tactics_desc:0 "The jungle is a tricky terrain, one which to the unprepared soldier, is as much if not more dangerous than the enemy itself. Neighua hunters have long learned to become trickier themselves and became experts in trap making. We can apply this to the way we wage war and formalize it to gain an edge over our enemies, most of whom have never seen much beyond welcoming woods."
JUN_nastive_tactics:0 "Lessons Of The Jungle"
JUN_nastive_tactics_desc:0 "While some argue for standardization of our army, it is undeniable that Aztlan's military situation is unique. As such, rather than pursuing unsuitable tactics, we should develop our own form of warfare. We have a long native tradition to draw from, as well as from my own companions. Foreign expertise is welcome but should come from more relevant places such as Puerto Caballo, Sicameon or Zebrica."
JUN_codetalkers:0 "The Huallauhatlatollamini"
JUN_codetalkers_desc:0 "Neighua dialects are by all accounts obscure languages. While it is highly disappointing when it comes to our cultural radiance worldwide, it may be a military asset. Enemies who intercept our messages would be hard pressed to gain any intel from them if they lack even a basic dictionary. We will take steps to assign communications tasks to Neighua soldiers or educate our officers in those dialects."
JUN_integrate_bat_units:0 "Integrate The Tzinacatl Divisions"
JUN_integrate_bat_units_desc:0 "For a long time now, our Neighua military staff has bitterly opposed allowing bat ponies in our military. This is a costly policy, one that could cost us victories in the bloody years to come. My contacts among the Tzinacatl do show that they are willing to serve Aztlan and are even eager to. It will take all my charm to convince the Neighuas and move forward but it is an investment well worth my time and effort."
JUN_officer_schools:0 "Officer Schools"
JUN_officer_schools_desc:0 "Despite the tireless work of my headhunters, we cannot hope to continue relying on gifted locals to lead our armies. We need to invest resources in opening officer schools in our settlements and educate the next generation of Aztlanian officers. We'll bring in foreign officers with a more orthodox military education. Equestrian defectors have already shown interests, as well as contacts in Sicameon and Puerto Caballo."
JUN_electronics_military:0 "Adopt the RADAR"
JUN_electronics_military_desc:0 "Waging war effectively always require information but the newly invented RADAR technology has transformed the ways one can acquire tactical information. It will require electrification and significant investment either in infrastructure or adapted vehicles but it will pay off in the long run."
JUN_spec_ops_department:0 "Special Forces Department"
JUN_spec_ops_department_desc:0 "During the war of independence, the Tzinacatl have proven to be vicious and stealthy warriors and in many cases, they have humbled even our best soldiers. We can harness their expertise in specialized units where only the best will serve."
JUN_army_of_aztlan:0 "The Protectors of Aztlan"
JUN_army_of_aztlan_desc:0 "Aztlan has long known woes of all kind. Our independence was stolen from us when we were betrayed by our god. No more. Aztlan now stands free. There may be war. There may be burning. Lives will be lost. But in the end, our enemies shall flee and our victorious soldiers will find their way home, to Tenochtitlan."

JUN_aztlan_airforce:0 "The Aztlan Airforce"
JUN_aztlan_airforce_desc:0 "When the Aztlanians used to look up in the sky, they would see nothing but Equestrian pegasi, Equestrian planes or the dreaded dragons. If I really want to safeguard our independence and control over the jungles, I'll need to build an airforce."
JUN_import_fighters:0 "Import Fighter Craft"
JUN_import_fighters_desc:0 "Aztlan as it stands doesn't have much in terms of planes in its airfield. If we are to dominate our own sky, we won't do it with repurposed civilian planes and repaired downed equestrian planes. I know some sellers back in Griffonia who can sell us some fighters for an honest price."
JUN_light_aircraft:0 "The Quetzalcoatl"
JUN_light_aircraft_desc:0 "Ever since creatures conquered the sky without magic or their own wings, the ponies of Aztlan only got to see foreign planes flying over their heads, whether it was Equestrian military planes or Aerobats trying to set records. But those days are behind us now that one of my engineer has put together plans for an entirely Aztlanian fighter plane: the Quetzacoatl."
JUN_CAS_f:0 "The Cuitlatlotli"
JUN_CAS_f_desc:0 "Warfare in the Southeast has been mostly land-based, with planes fighting their own war. But many of my pilots have proven to be anxious to help our soldiers on the ground. As a result, many have been sanctioned for dangerous low-altitude actions but many are calling to put them to use instead. I'll get these crazy heroes some appropriate planes!"
JUN_import_bombers:0 "Import Bomber Craft"
JUN_import_bombers_desc:0 "Using our planes to prevent hostile bombers from wrecking our forces and infrastructure is a desirable goal but it leaves so much potential unexplored. Through contacts in Sicameon, we have found opportunities to import our very own bombers. It's time that we are able to turn tables on our enemies."
JUN_bomber_aircraft:0 "The Cuauhtli"
JUN_bomber_aircraft_desc:0 "Importing Bombers has allowed us to bolster our airforce but it is a costly and unreliable source. Our engineer have studied the model and through some retro engineering, they have come up with a new model, one that can be built locally at a much cheaper cost."
JUN_heavier_bombers:0 "The Tepopoloani"
JUN_heavier_bombers_desc:0 "Tactical bombing is all well and good but our engineers have pushed forward a new concept, one that is revolutionizing warfare throughout the world : long-range bombing. No more will war in the Southeast be a distant affair read about in the ninth page of the newspaper for our bombers will bring war to our enemies' home."
JUN_build_the_airstrips:0 "Construct the Airstrips"
JUN_build_the_airstrips_desc:0 "One of the most significant issue we are still facing today is the lack of airfields in Aztlan. The old airstrips on the coast have served their purpose but they are not enough. Our pilots still dread any issue when flying over our own jungle heartland. We need to take steps so our cities are connected to our airways."
JUN_train_the_pilots:0 "Train The Pilots"
JUN_train_the_pilots_desc:0 "My airforce has seen significant improvement since its early days. However, my pilot corps still leaves to be desired. Even by the kindest terms, it remains a ragtag bunch of adventurers, unreliable defectors and self-taught pilots who managed to survive. While I can appreciate that sort of things, we can't expect to rely on them much longer. It is time to establish a standardized training program for our recruits and to create a proper air academy."
JUN_heavier_fighters:0 "The Tepoz Cuauhtli"
JUN_heavier_fighters_desc:0 "Even with our investments in airfields, the Southeast remains a difficult place to fly over. Many a good pilot has been lost to the jungle or mechanical failure due to exhausted engines. As sturdy our Quetzacoatls are, we can only push them so far. Our military staff and engineers have issued a plan for a new kind of heavy fighter : the Tepoz Cuauhtli. With it, they say, true air superiority is achievable."
JUN_night_fliers:0 "Night Fliers"
JUN_night_fliers_desc:0 "Since times immemorial, Aztlanians have known the value of hunting in the night. Let us put that martial tradition to use in the air! May our enemies experience the terrors of the night in Aztlan..."
JUN_expert_fliers:0 "Children Of Quetzalcoatl"
JUN_expert_fliers_desc:0 ""Look up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It IS a plane! And that plane belongs to the Aztlan Airforce!""

JUN_aztlan_navy:0 "The Aztlan Navy"
JUN_aztlan_navy_desc:0 "For centuries, Aztlan has been denied free access to the sea but now that we are free from Equestrian imperialism, we may begin to work on a navy and truly open ourselves to the world."
JUN_baltimare_port:0 "The Baltimare Dockyards"
JUN_baltimare_port_desc:0 "The dockyards in Baltimare have been one of the most important ones in the southeast. Sadly, they have been badly damaged when we wrestled control over the city from the revolutionaries. With some repairs, this symbol of equestrian naval power may become one for Aztlan."
JUN_stableside_port:0 "The Stableside Dockyards"
JUN_stableside_port_desc:0 "Stableside is one of the few cities in the Southeast that has an actual industrial capacity, and the only coastal one at that. As such, it is home to many civilian dockyards but with some investment from our part, we could transform it into a major military harbour. Without those investments, the dream of an Aztlanian navy will remain just that."
JUN_destroyer_f:0 "The Aztlan Coast Guard"
JUN_destroyer_f_desc:0 "Equus' southeastern coast is a dangerous place. Pirates and privateers are no rarity and dragons flying over from their isles often cause chaos in naval activities. Establishing a Coast Guard will allow us to begin establishing some order. I probably should tip off some of my friends about this."
JUN_light_cruiser_f:0 "Heavier Plating"
JUN_light_cruiser_f_desc:0 "Small destroyers and repurposed civilian ships will only take us so far in creating a navy. We need to invest in cruisers able to withstand prolonged combat. At first, we may use them as command ships for our coastal fleets but in the years to come, they will be a significant asset to support our larger ships."
JUN_saltmane_port:0 "The Saltmane Dockyards"
JUN_saltmane_port_desc:0 "Baltimare and Stableside are serving their purpose as naval bases but their position on our periphery is hurting our naval capabilities. Meanwhile, our strategically placed coastal city of Saltmane is severely lacking in naval infrastructure. By aggressively investing there, we can finally link up our northern and southwestern navies and facilitate communication between our naval staff and Tenochtitlan."
JUN_submarine_f:0 "The Hidden Navy"
JUN_submarine_f_desc:0 "Even with heavy investments, it will take a long time for Aztlan to have a navy capable of withstanding direct contact. However, we are no stranger to asymmetrical warfare and fighting stronger forces. Let us take into account the lessons of our land warfare history and apply them to our naval plans. Our submarines shall lurk under the sea until we are ready for more orthodox forms of naval combat."
JUN_heavy_cruiser_f:0 "Light Battleships"
JUN_heavy_cruiser_f_desc:0 "Our dockyards have proven to be surprisingly adaptable to our growing demands on building and maintaining warships. The reports on our cruiser experiments have demonstrated that they are ready for heavier experiments. As a result, our naval engineers have put forward a plan to create a light battleship, the first one to be named the Caballeron, in my honor."
JUN_doctrianl_development:0 "Doctrinal Development"
JUN_doctrianl_development_desc:0 "Despite our progress, our naval staff is still a mess composed of Baltimarean defectors and sailor friends of mine. This has lead my navy to function without a proper doctrine. We need to sort out the doctrinal debate and fix ourselves some objectives about how my navy is to operate. Aztlan's independence may very well depend on it."
JUN_battleship_f:0 "The War Navy"
JUN_battleship_f_desc:0 "As it stands, Aztlan is a small power still but the seas are merciless where the weak are swept aside. If we are to exist as a naval power, we need a true true war navy, one that will be lead by true fortresses of the seas. It will be a difficult and long endeavour but if I do not take steps towards this end now, Aztlan shall never be safe, let alone powerful on the world stage."
JUN_carrier_f:0 "Carrier Experiments"
JUN_carrier_f_desc:0 "Anypony sailing in the Southeast has already witnessed a dragon flying over them. This has lead many of my naval officers to understand early on the potential and power of air power applied to naval warfare. This has lead to many early designs for carrier ships, most of which were utterly unattainable for our meager naval capabilities. With our newly acquired experience and infrastructure, we can attempt to build a sea-worthy prototype."
JUN_new_admirality:0 "The Aztlan Admiralty"
JUN_new_admirality_desc:0 "With the incredible progress achieved by my fledgling navy, it is time for us to finally establish it as an independent branch of our military forces. Gone are the days our naval operations were haphazardly directed from Tenochtitlan. An independent Admiralty will be set up in their own new headquarters in the modernized port of Saltmane. From there, my admirals can work on our dream of seeing one day Aztlan rule the waves."

JUN_the_three_regions:0 "The Three Regions"
JUN_the_three_regions_desc:0 "The war of independence is over and now I must attend to the duties of statecraft. The dangers of budget balancing are not as thrilling as those of a jungle trek but there is no less urgency in it. As it stands, Aztlan is more of a cobbled-together mess of three barely connected regions than a united nation. Worse, all three of them have been left devastated by war and bad Equestrian policies. Choices will have to be made and with the state of our treasury, they won't be easy ones."
JUN_stableside_region:0 "Stableside"
JUN_stableside_region_desc:0 "To the west lies Stableside, the main port and industrial region in our territory and one dedicated to the extraction of resources. During the war, it was home to Daring Do's loyalists."
JUN_the_steel_mills:0 "Support The Steel Mills"
JUN_the_steel_mills_desc:0 "Geologists in the last decade speculated that the Macintosh mountains were home to significant deposits of coal and iron. Some Hoofington industrialists had begun to try and tap into it but the civil war put the lid on that. However, the mines they had begun to set up are still there and industrialists in Stableside have expressed interest in the steel industry. With some support, I can help them take the place of the Hoofington ponies."
JUN_the_arms_factories:0 "Subsidise The Arms Industry"
JUN_the_arms_factories_desc:0 "Despite the presence of some small-arms companies, the Southeast has little in the way of weapons manufacturing. With my treasury having more flies than gold, I can hardly afford state industry but I can subsidise the private industrialists willing to set it up themselves. With these subsidies, I can attract some opportunistic weapons manufacturers. The world usually has no shortage of them."
JUN_bauxite_mines:0 "Bauxite Mining"
JUN_bauxite_mines_desc:0 "Ever since the Stalliongrad revolution, the aluminium industry in Equestria has been in crisis. Without access to the Severyanian production, Equestria has been forced to rely on Olenian and foreign imports. Lucky for us, a geologist found traces of bauxite in the Sirius region. They remain largely untapped but with some investments, we can open large scale mining as well as smelteries in Galloprey."
JUN_portland_oil_wells:0 "Portland Oil Wells"
JUN_portland_oil_wells_desc:0 "During my travels, I once met an adventurer who explained to me that the Cueztpalliztli jungle was rich in oil deposits. Once he returned home to Manehattan, he was sure to become incredibly wealthy from the discovery, he said. Sadly for him, the malaria took him but I never forgot about the story. And now I've got the means to do something with it!"
JUN_connect_the_area:0 "Connect The Stargulf Railway"
JUN_connect_the_area_desc:0 "Without the Stargulf railways connected to the capital, the resources we extract in Sirius, Portland and the Macintosh mountains will pretty much sit there, useless. I need to connect them fast or all my efforts will have been for nothing."

JUN_stableside_primacy_desc:0 "Thanks to my help, the wheels of industry in Stableside are turning once more. The pre-war industrial city is back but with further heavy investment, we could bring a military industry to life there!"
JUN_central_region:0 "Tenochtitlan"
JUN_central_region_desc:0 "Tenochtitlan lies in a central position within our state and is the heart of the old Neighua civilisation. It is also the city from which I rule and a region close to my heart ever since I was but a student archeologist. It is also the poorest of our regions. There is a lot to be done here."
JUN_connect_the_jungles:0 "Connect The Tribes"
JUN_connect_the_jungles_desc:0 "The greatest issue faced by the Neighua and other tribes is the lack of transportation and communication between various settlements. Now that we are free from the imperialist mindset of Celestia's administration, we can connect them in a way that allows the tribes to meet and live together once more. Some will complain that these roads will be expensive and inefficient but I say some things are well worth the cost!"
JUN_technochitlan_university:0 "Tenochtitlan University"
JUN_technochitlan_university_desc:0 "When I wrote my thesis on the Tenochtitlan civilisation, I complained about the lack of archeological studies on the Neighua history. And in the years that followed, it only grow worse as all of Aztlan became nothing more than a decor for Daring Do's adventure books! It is time that this city becomes a scholarly center. If we are to kickstart a revival of this region, we must first learn to know ourselves."
JUN_tourism:0 "Support The Tourism Industry"
JUN_tourism_desc:0 "Tenochtitlan's jungles may not have towering skyscrapers, nor does it have buzzing marketplaces or humming factories. What it has is a raw and untamed beauty, one I fell in love with a long time ago. Creatures around the world may not know it but they need to see it, to experience the life changing experience that is roaming about the jungle. And I'll provide it to them. For a price."
JUN_limited_exploitation:0 "Limited Exploitation"
JUN_limited_exploitation_desc:0 "Aztlanian jungles are rich in rubber and industrialists have been pestering me to exploit them. There is no glamour or beauty in the rubber business but it pays and a modern world requires a lot of it. Unfortunately, it is also an industry that requires vast swathes of land as you simply can't make intensive use of the lands for those trees. I will allow exploitation, albeit on a limited scale. Those greedy bastards would bleed this jungle dry if left unchecked."
JUN_national_parks:0 "The National Park Act"
JUN_national_parks_desc:0 "As an archeology student, I was naive about how easy it would be to preserve the Aztlanian lands. However, statecraft is a costly business when one won't exploit resources put at his disposal. I cannot save this land at large but I can preserve much of it. I will enact a law setting aside some land to be forever kept as virgin as they were when the Sun and the Moon began their dance in the sky and let the rest be open for the destructive march of civilisation."
JUN_technochitlan_primacy:0 "Tenochtitlan Primacy"
JUN_technochitlan_primacy_desc:0 "Through hard work and careful policies, I am bringing Aztlan out of the dark age Equestria left it in. However, Tenochtitlan has not been built in a day and a true revival of the Neighua civilisation is still a distant goal, one I can only achieve at a great cost."
JUN_baltimare_region:0 "Baltimare"
JUN_baltimare_region_desc:0 "The region lies at the north of our territory and strategically located at the entrance of the Eclipse Gulf. During the war of independence, it was home to the second socialist revolution in Equus and it is now our gateway to the wealthy Equestrian east coast. If we are to pacify this city, we will need to rekindle its economic flame."
JUN_steel_mills_baltimare:0 "The Baltimare Coal Mines"
JUN_steel_mills_baltimare_desc:0 "During the industrial revolution, Baltimare became a major center of coal production. While it ruined much of the countryside, it also gave the city jobs and a valuable resource to export. While Equestria had access to other options, I do not. The Baltimare rebirth will begin with coal and with it steel."
JUN_industrial_development_bal:0 "Industrial Grants"
JUN_industrial_development_bal_desc:0 "Baltimare is home to a large population and many skilled workers. What it has always lacked is interest and attention from Canterlot and coastal industrialists. But who am I if not the pony that sees opportunities where others do not? With some grants, I can help new industries to grow and thrive there."
JUN_industrial_tech_f:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
JUN_industrial_tech_f_desc:0 "I have little interest in the "science" that industrial optimization is supposed to be but I've been told that a lot of money can be made with "streamlining" and other nonsense. Apparently, local sociologists and union workers have designed a number of improvements that would make our industry both safer and more productive. I'll give them room to do whatever and pray never to hear the sound of their voice again."
JUN_baltimare_technical_institute:0 "Baltimare Technical Institute"
JUN_baltimare_technical_institute_desc:0 "Baltimare is home to many skilled workers but most of them had to learn their craft the hard way and couldn't even use their skills to leverage better wages. Labor unions have long argued for public technical institutes to teach fillies and colts valuable professional skills. Industrialists only care about their bottom line but I, doctor Cabelleron, understands the value of education. I'll give the unions their schools."

JUN_economic_prosperity_desc:0 "Gone are the days the Southeast used to be a downtrodden region. Our investments have paid off and we are now experiencing a golden age. However, choices had to be made and while I can see a bright future for my people, the thought of what could have been had I chosen differently still haunts me.

JUN_meet_the_unions_desc:0 "Out of all of the enemies I fought, the Socialists of Baltimare and their Unions proved themselves to be my most ardent opponents. Even now the remnants of CAN and TER resist my rule, but maybe just maybe I could sway some of the less extreme Unions to my side."

JUN_meet_the_resistance_desc:0 "It appears as if some ponies simply can't see the writing on the wall.

If I am to have any hope in uniting the ponies of Aztlan under one banner she must be stopped."
JUN_proclaim_the_federation:0 "Proclaim The Federation"
JUN_proclaim_the_federation_desc:0 "Aztlan has always been an odd place. Thousands of languages, cultures, and tribes big and small inhabit its vast jungles while the coasts are lorded over by Equestrians. It's to be quite frank a miracle that the entire region had not exploded sooner; nevertheless the way forward is clear, if I am to rule this land everypony must have a voice and federalism is just the tool I need to accomplish that."
JUN_pardon_leaders:0 "Pardon The Leaders"

JUN_allow_unions_desc:0 "What they propose doesn't seem out of the borders of what I would call reasonable. I cannot always be there for my ponies, and I say unions can help me with that. I will allow them, provided they don't pull any antics and do their job aiding the civilians."

JUN_the_language_act_desc:0 "It appears I have earned a great favour of the local tribes, it is now my turn to return them the boon. They value their culture greatly, while I did my best to preserve their land and sacred places, I can do them a courtesy more. I will make them official members of our society, by making their languages official."

JUN_pardon_the_offenders:0 "Give Out The Pardons"
JUN_pardon_the_offenders_desc:0 "While the thestrals have been promised the same rights as any of our other citizens. However, several of my advisors have rightfully pointed out that this could very easily be interpeted as a trap by the thestral community seeing as a large part of them are still seen as criminals due to their participation in the war. Thus I have decided to issue pardons to any and all thestrals that surrender peacefully."
JUN_religious_tolerance:0 "The Tolerance Act"

### Events ###
jungle.1.t:0 "The Paramount Chiefs"
jungle.1.d:0 "One is never sure what to expect when they meet the local tribes whose lands you come into. I studied them, but I can't be ready for everything. Will they be savage? Will they ambush us? Will they want to work together with us? Though, it still gives me hope that they agreed to this meeting. We're not in the best position to bargain right now.\n\nYet still, despite all the possible issues, the Neighua chiefs were friendly to us. Perhaps, they appreciate the respect I tried to show for their culture, or they simply realize that the war closing in around us can threaten their peace as well as their stability, or even their well-being. The summit was a success, and they will aid us in finding our place in these jungles, while we will offer them protection.\n\nWhile their strings were easy to pull, they made themselves clear, they will cooperate, on the condition that we respect their customs, their tradition and their culture. A small price to pay for the shelter of an ancient and powerful ally who know the landscape better than any one of us ever will."
jungle.1.a:0 "I'm glad we are working together."

jungle.2.t:0 "Hearts And Minds"
jungle.2.d:0 "It seems that both of us came to the same conclusion, a misfortune united us, but it is I who will turn it into our fortune. Same as us, they see the great benefit of our cooperation, we provide them with a barrier, better infrastructure and the possibility to rebuild their long lost greatness, the structures that were beaten and eroded with time, the harsh jungle weather and the previous occupants. While on their end, they give us insight on the landscape, the safe paths, the dangerous glades and even some hidden treasures.\n\nIt was an underestimation from my side, what they're capable of. A frail mistake, to doubt them, but that doesn't matter now, for our hearts and minds are focused on the same purpose, survival.\n\nWe shall see how our mutual future will turn out, but for now, this alliance proves itself to be a promising treat."
jungle.2.a:0 "Aztlan shall be free!"

jungle.3.t:0 "Conflicts of Interest"
jungle.3.d:0 "It appears that our local friends are not too happy with the recent expansion of our logging efforts. Soon after the new mills started toppling the glades and piling the wood, the chiefs called us for an emergency meeting.\n\nThey were adamant about the value of land for them, the resources it provided, a relationship that should not be overstepped. They looked at me with a lightning glare, but their dissatisfaction still finished with only puffs and grunts, as they did not take any major actions about it.\n\nWhile resources are required, I did not want to show signs of weakness. Neighua do not like weakness, that I know well. However, we can only hope that they do understand the purpose of our actions, the enormous war effort that we carry, and forgive us for it. I may be harsh, but I think I was too harsh this time. Hm, I shall yet rebuild their jungle sweep and wide."
jungle.3.a:0 "Rather unfortunate."

jungle.4.t:0 "Squatter Troubles"
jungle.4.d:0 "Our continued effort to gather more resources has attracted new interest to our territories. Not all of it, however, I can call positive and useful. A problem arose out of it, the squatters started taking up more and more of our space.\n\nOne can only wonder where do they even come from, but riches, or even better, commodities, do appear to have that effect. The surrounding areas of our pantries is more like slums for poor and adventurers alike now. They don't seem to have the intention to leave, either.\n\nThough I need to focus on my own kind first, this pest do not seem to be all that harmful, other than to our supplies and reputation, yet we cannot ignore them.\n\nThere is strength in numbers, we have enough resources, I'll find a use for these lackeys. Unlike the sun, the work never sets at the horizon, there's always more of it. If they wish to stay, they will stay, but first they'll earn their bread."
jungle.4.a:0 "At least we can put them to work..."

jungle.5.t:0 "The Wonders of Irrigation"
jungle.5.d:0 "Oh, water, a crucial resource for any civilisation, and these jungles are abundant with it. From humidity to rivers, sometimes I wish there was less of it. But by taming the flow of the river, we can utilise it to suit our every need.\n\nOur fields bloom, our citizens thrive, all thanks to the improved infrastructure. Truly a display of our power and a victory for our well-being. The influence we exert on this realm only grows.\n\nAhh, the wonders of irrigation. "
jungle.5.a:0 "Ain't it beautiful?"

jungle.6.t:0 "An Amazing Discovery"
jungle.6.d:0 "Restoring the old ruins was no easy task, I knew that myself. The stones, old, crude, uneven, are hard to work with. I feared that this whole operation will be more woeful than it would be profitable.\n\nUntil, one day, we hit upon a secret chamber in one of the ruins' catacombs compartments. It was filled with riches beyond my imagination, and this time, no pesky adventurers to stop me from claiming what is mine. The locals were right when they told us to investigate this place. I can only wonder if perhaps, they wanted us to find these? Nevertheless, the discovery raised the spirits of the ponies, and it seemed as if all the previous inconveniences simply vanished and the work continued without a hitch.\n\nWith all the new structures in place, and the fresh treasures in our vaults, this province starts looking all the more promising to me."
jungle.6.a:0 "Gold, gems, and more!"

jungle.7.t:0 "Native Complaints"
jungle.7.d:0 "The war is looming on us all, and we are in no way having an advantageous predicament in it yet. The fight has weakened us, drained us of our resources, hit our morale. I'm afraid it is time for more desperate measures.\n\nWe have resorted to calling in a few favours with the natives, which allowed us to gather more equipment for the war machine that we must guide now. Weapons, supplies, anything goes, so long that it helps us take an edge in the conflict we face.\n\nUnfortunately, the natives were not satisfied with our actions and demands. But they will understand the inevitability of the situation and the price it carries."
jungle.7.a:0 "It's a necessary evil."

jungle.8.t:0 "The New Aztlan"
jungle.8.d:0 "The war is over, the sound of bullets do not fill our ears anymore, there is no need to hide in the cellar in fear of what lurks outside. The time when we were just a sorry bunch of survivors is over, and I will do my best to keep it that way.\n\nI will make a great country in here, these jungles suit me, after all. Although I did not anticipate how much I'll have to conquer in order to end this war. But my ponies need a leader, and they will have it, I will not let them down.\n\nWhile there are still remnants of the Lunar army and those who are hostile to my rule, I'd still mark it as an improvement to war. This is but a start of a new era, so, let's get to work."
jungle.8.a:0 "Well... Guess I'm a Dictator now."

jungle.9.t:0 "A Meeting With The Unions"
jungle.9.d:0 "With a heavy heart and cautious approach do I go to this meeting with Golden Delicious and other union representatives. After seeing what the ponies of TER are capable of, I am truly unsure what to expect here.\n\nBut the talks went just fine, they didn't try anything they would regret. And while I find their talk about the population or workers tedious, I can understand their point. My ponies need organisation, and it seems these unions can provide me just that. And they, clearly, wish to exist in their own ideology from before. At least they are not as radical as some others I have seen, so that's a plus.\n\nWhile our current discussion was a success, we've yet much to do before there's any real fruition. But I must say, I am pleasantly surprised."
jungle.9.a:0 "Reasonable ponies, all in all."

jungle.10.t:0 "Meeting The Paramount Chiefs"
jungle.10.d:0 "I once studied these southern tribes, my intent was to turn profit. I fled here to turn profit, but my time here taught me much. I made a powerful and a very loyal ally among these tribes, and they had my back. I feel foolish for simply using them to meet my ends in the past.\n\nFortunately, they have found a liking in me and they understand that without me, they would be in a much worse state than they are now. However, they made sure that I understood that their support didn't come free and that they expected change. I accepted.\n\nI brought them gifts. True gifts, not colonial baubles, as a token of my gratitude for our alliance, little did I know they had more on their mind for the celebration. They greeted me like a hero, and now, a feast is in order."
jungle.10.a:0 "Glad we still have their support."

jungle.11.t:0 "In The Jungle"
jungle.11.d:0 "While we have defeated our enemies in open battle, they keep fighting us in the jungles, attacking villages in the darkness, smashing convoys and terrorising the civilians. The thestrals that lived under them still do not trust us, but that may yet be changed.\n\nI deem it unsafe to venture into the jungle without a gun and it is an advice I made sure to share around me. I did not launch myself in this war to allow the daily murder of innocents to become the norm.\n\nThe howling shrieks echo every night, it cannot continue like this much longer. Things must change, and change soon. But the terrorists underestimate me and my partisans. We've grown accustomed to the jungle way of life and we'll smoke them out, one way or another. I can't have my ponies live in constant fear because of some terrorists in the woods, I will smother this insufferable insurgency."
jungle.11.a:0 "We'll beat them eventually..."

jungle.12.t:0 "The Federation"
jungle.12.d:0 "A small state we once were, but those days are long over. We've fought a war, we've earned our freedom, no more we are a rogue state, now, we're a proper state, a country, we are Aztlan. A jungle, we have conquered, we made new allies who still stand by our side, all to be able to proudly say that we are free.\n\nI've assessed our current state, while not in mint condition, I vow to make it right. We've threats within, I will tend to them with a firm hoof, there will be no terror in Aztlan.\n\nAnd so, I, Caballeron, proclaim Aztlan to be a federation, we will stand proud next to one another. Our cause is just, our ponies, noble, it is not the question of survival anymore, now, it's discipline and order. The days of refuge are over."
jungle.12.a:0 "Long live Aztlan!"

jungle.13.t:0 "The Red Folder"
jungle.13.d:0 "The war of independence has been a bloody affair but so has the revolution in Baltimare. And the years before that. A lot of mistakes, big and small, have been committed. And after the fall of Baltimare, a lot of ponies have been willing to talk. They did an awful lot of talking actually. And as an adventurer, I got to meet a lot of former union workers who got thrown under the bus by their comrades and who told me a lot of other stories around a good drink. And all of these little stories are in my pretty red folder but I would never publish it of course.\n\nFew wish to recall the recent events. After all, this war didn't bring out the best in most of us. It is with this in mind that I have decided that it's time to put aside our differences for once. To pardon our enemies is a great virtue, one that I do not give lightly.\n\nI put great expectations on this partnership and I'm sure the socially-minded among us will meet them. Peace is the greater virtue that I seek and we can have no peace without trust, so trust each other we must.\n\nThey have welcomed my forgiveness, told me how they hope we'll work well together. I hope they spoke sincerely... It's good to have allies in these dark times. I need more friends and less foes in here."
jungle.13.a:0 "And if any of them gets too uppity, I have ways to shut them up."

jungle.14.t:0 "Lifting The Union Ban"
jungle.14.d:0 "After observing and cooperating with the unions for some time, I have decided that it's time to lift the union ban in Baltimare and beyond. They've proven their good will when cooperating with our industrialists, which is a reassuring feeling. I'm glad the plan is coming together.\n\nWith that in place, the discontent grows weaker, so I'm sure we're on a steady road to find stability once more. My subjects will live well, a life they deserve, a life I will give them.\n\nThere were no indicators so far that my trust in unions was misplaced, it better stay that way."
jungle.14.a:0 "Let's hope they won't cause too many issues."

jungle.15.t:0 "The Stallionist Trials"
jungle.15.d:0 "All the atrocities of the war of independence keep surfacing like rotten fish in a stream. While I intend to cooperate with the socialists, I will not stand for rabid extremism. I've had my eyes on these Stallionists ever since Baltimare fell. I have tried but they simply won't budge. They've long sat in their cells, still unwilling to give up their diehard and fanatical beliefs. It must end now.\n\nThe trial was quick and without doubt as to the guilt of the condemned. I made sure of it and I also made sure the socialists would abide by the sentence. It was surprisingly easy. Turns out Lavender Berry wasn't all that loved among his comrades.\n\nWhen the sentence was pronounced, the miserable stallion couldn't even take it with dignity. He fell on his knees and begged for mercy. He blubbered on incoherently, making up excuses on the spot and trying to shift the blame on others. Few could even watch such a parody of justice. He kept blubbering until life left his body."
jungle.15.a:0 "Let this be an example."

jungle.16.t:0 "Socialist Parties Unbanned"
jungle.16.d:0 "With the progress made in regards to cooperation with the socialists, it seems they are delivering on their promises. I must say, Cricket Chafer has proven to be a valuable asset, and it is time I complete my end of the bargain.\n\nI will allow socialist parties to freely exist in Aztlan. Consider this to be my token of trust and gratitude so long as my ponies get to exist in peace and order.\n\nI am looking forward to our mutual coexistence."
jungle.16.a:0 "Just don't let it get out of hoof."

jungle.17.t:0 "The Native Language Act"
jungle.17.d:0 "The tribes have been the biggest aid in the forepassed conflict, but they will not be bygone. I have given them a promise to preserve and respect their culture, and that is what I will do. I am proud to be called their icniuhtli, and no friend of mine will be forgotten.\n\nI decree that the languages of the ponies native to these jungles are to be considered official languages of Aztlan. Any document, plea, decree or communication in them is to be considered valid and to be accepted. I welcome our allies with a big heart.\n\nLet's hope this doesn't get too complicated."
jungle.17.a:0 "That's a lot of languages..."

jungle.18.t:0 "Meeting The Thestral Leaders"
jungle.18.d:0 "My plan worked! Soon after my word spread, I found a mysterious note saying that its unnamed author wished to meet. From the tiny Moon in the corner of the paper I figured it was the thestrals. They didn't ask to be alone, so I asked my trusted henchponies to go with me for this meeting.\n\nThe meeting was meant to take place in a clearing nearby, in the dead of night. At first, nothing, but soon, the leaves of trees and bushes rustled and they emerged, the thestral leaders. Unarmed, they instantly expressed their intent to be a peaceful one.\n\nI listened to what they had to say. I must say I didn't imagine how many of them were not unaligned with the extremists. They reserved to hide, as they didn't feel we could accept them but tired of war and futile bloodshed, they answered my call.\n\nThe reign of terror is not to their liking either, they ask for our.. protection? It seems the extremists are to nopony's liking here. That must be our next step."
jungle.18.a:0 "That went better than I expected."

jungle.19.t:0 "Hunting The Terrorists"
jungle.19.d:0 "With a few hunting parties armed to the teeth and the knowledge of our enemies, we venture into the jungle to cut down the lunarist resistance. Each step, we venture deeper into the enemy territory, the only sliver of hope we get is that it is not the night right now.\n\nWith only few hissing, but dormant thestrals encountered at first, the numbers grew, we knew we were moving closer to the heart. Suddenly, a scent of firewood. A camp, hidden in a deep and lush glade, it can be no one else. With no sentries alerted, my henchponies and I encircle this camp and prepare to strike.\n\nWhile this mission is dangerous, I prefer to attend to these matters personally. If these terrorists wish to defile my subjects, then they will fear the one who leads them. My loyal henchponies prepare to deliver the fatal blow while the enemy is weak, on my mark..."
jungle.19.a:0 "Gentleponies, we got them."

jungle.20.t:0 "The Thestral Pardons"
jungle.20.d:0 "Distressed thestrals swarm my cities, and while I should focus on my own ponies, I cannot leave them behind. The threat of terror is still on the razor's edge, not every thestral can be trusted, so a cautious approach is required.\n\nI have decided that they can stay with us, but on one condition, they agree to be identified in order to be pardoned. If a thestral proves their innocence, they will get a pardon and rights among us, and I hope I won't regret doing this. Although, these thestrals seem to be promising, I hope my ponies won't riot this decision."
jungle.20.a:0 "Wonderful."

jungle.21.t:0 "The Religious Tolerance Act"
jungle.21.d:0 "Thestrals have lived in my cities for some time now where fortunately they didn't cause any trouble. Moreover, they seem to be aiding us in clearing the extremist remnants once and for all, which is a nice change of pace. If we continue like this, order will be restored in no time.\n\nOur cooperation with these thestrals is a warm relationship, they don't need much, given basic rights they are thankful beyond measure. But I owe them for their tireless and determined assistance, perhaps it's time to recognise their beliefs as well, so they can find a new home here.\n\nWhile the angry murmurs of the tribal population worry me, the happy squeaking that fills the streets is a welcome change. Hopefully, there will yet be amity among all my subjects."
jungle.21.a:0 "Hopefully the Neighua won't throw a fit..."

jungle.22.t:0 "The Civil War"
jungle.22.d:0 "We've come a long way since we were but a small bunch of adventurers and natives determined not to be crushed by the Civil War. And here I am, at the helm of a whole nation, but I was not born a leader. I made so many mistakes along the way, broken so many promises, fought battles I had no desire to be in. My old self is screaming at me to pack my gold and bolt. But this was the old Caballeron, the one that deserved to be the villain of Daring Do's bloody books... I do not know if I can guide my ponies in the right direction for long but I won't betray them.\n\nI'm considering joining hooves with those who used to oppress this region: Equestria. There is no glory in this but the Civil War continues to rage on and should Equestria fall, I fear whatever will have broken it. The loyalists back in Stableside are assuring me that a plea can be done : help in exchange for forgiveness and autonomy.\n\nMaybe I'm galloping toward disaster but I have no time to ponder anymore. Time is of the essence. Does the Aztlan I've build with my allies enough to stand on its own, or do I bend the knee?"
jungle.22.a:0 "Send the offer."
jungle.22.b:0 "No, this is not our fight."

jungle.23.t:0 "The Offer"
jungle.23.d:0 "We have received a message from Caballeron, Aztlan's dictator. Despite him taking advantage of the civil war to establish his private little rogue state, he has offered us help and support in the civil war. This has taken us by surprise. Many call the offer an obvious and preposterous attempt at bribery so that we let him off the hook for his secessionist activities when the dust settles.\n\nYet we can hardly afford to discard help, even if it is coming from a scoundrel like Caballeron. The choice is difficult: to offer a welcoming hoof to those who have realized their mistakes or to punish traitors, all of them?"
jungle.23.a:0 "Tell Caballeron he has a deal."
jungle.23.b:0 "We do not negotiate with rogue states."

jungle.24.t:0 "Equestria Accepts"
jungle.24.d:0 "The Equestrian government has agreed to our plea... While I am happy to know that the future of my ponies should now be safe from Equestria's wrath, I am sad to admit my failure. Aztlan won't truly be free anymore but at least, it will be safe and that is enough for me.\n\nAlas, we are saved, but now to the war we must go. Let's hope our situation doesn't get worse than it already is."
jungle.24.a:0 "Pour me a drink. No ice."

jungle.25.t:0 "Equestria Declines"
jungle.25.d:0 "Alas, the Equestrians has send my emissaries packing. I guess I'm still on my own here, for better or for worse. I've got to find other allies and cherish the ones I have, to keep us safe.\n\nIt is time I return to the matters at hoof, if I want to secure the best possible future for my ponies, I must work harder."
jungle.25.a:0 "Oh bollocks!"

jungle.26.t:0 "The Fate Of Aztlan"
jungle.26.d:0 "We've come a long way since we were but a small bunch of adventurers and natives determined not to be crushed by the Civil War. And here I am, at the helm of a whole nation, but I was not born a leader. I made so many mistakes along the way, broken so many promises, fought battles I had no desire to be in. My old self is screaming at me to pack my gold and bolt. But this was the old Caballeron, the one that deserved to be the villain of Daring Do's bloody books... I do not know if I can guide my ponies in the right direction for long but I won't betray them.\n\nI'm considering joining hooves with those who used to oppress this region: Equestria. There is no glory in this but should Equestria turn their eyes on us, I fear we won't be able to withstand the tide. And should Equestria itself fail, I shudder to think about what horrors await us. The loyalists back in Stableside are assuring me that a plea can be done: help in exchange for forgiveness and autonomy.\n\nMaybe I'm galloping toward disaster but I have no time to ponder anymore: If I don't act first, Equestria will. Time is of the essence. Does the Aztlan I've build with my allies jave enough to stand on its own, or do I bend the knee?"
jungle.26.a:0 "Send the offer."
jungle.26.b:0 "No, this is not our fight."

jungle.27.t:0 "The Offer"
jungle.27.d:0 "We have received a message from Caballeron, Aztlan's dictator. Despite him taking advantage of the civil war to establish his private little rogue state, he has offered to peacefully reunite with Equestria, albeit with some concessions on our parts. Surprisingly enough, the Aztlanian delegation did not come alone and representatives from our most loyal subjects in Stableside and notables of Baltimare have accompanied them. They are assuring us that Caballeron, despite his reputation, is acting in good faith and has indeed implemented somewhat necessary reforms regarding the southeastern natives. The offer has swayed some in Canterlot.\n\nHowever, accepting could set a dangerous precedent. Can we afford to let violent secessionists shed blood and then use their illegitimately acquired position to extract policy concessions from us? Maybe, in this day and age, we must find the strength to be ruthless."
jungle.27.a:0 "We accept."
jungle.27.b:0 "We do not negotiate with rogue states."

jungle.28.t:0 "Equestria Accepts"
jungle.28.d:0 "The Equestrian government has agreed to our plea, and while I am sad to admit defeat, I feel that my ponies will be in safer hooves now. Aztlan may not be free anymore, but its inhabitants will be safe. Neighua culture will be preserved. Bat ponies will be respected and the Southeast will no more be forgotten. That is victory enough for me and yet, I feel something has been lost."
jungle.28.a:0 "Hurrah!"

jungle.29.t:0 "Equestria Declines"
jungle.29.d:0 "The plea has failed. Our emissaries have been sent back. And so, here we are. Waiting for a war that may never come or erupt tomorrow. Here comes what both the soldier and the adventurer like me hate: the wait. And it will cause tensions. The beautiful unity we achieved will be difficult to maintain. I can already feel the anxiety among the loyalists and the traps we'll find along the way. We'll manage. I hope... What did I get myself into this time?"
jungle.29.a:0 "Poor me a drink and leave the bottle."

jungle.30.t:0 "The Broken Engine"
jungle.30.d:0 "While no economic giant at the continental level, Stableside is the industrial heart of the Southeast. Encompassing the eastern shore of Stargulf, Stableside and the smaller Galloprey were primarily used by Equestrian elites as an extraction and refining center of the Southeast resources. The two cities were even connected to the other cities of the Stargulf and their hinterlands through a major and recent railway network creatively called the Stargulf Express. The rest of the region is a bit less fascinating, dominated by jungles and only visited by settlers to establish logging camps and mines. As for the southeastern tips of Equus where the small town of Portland lies, they are nothing more than a hunting ground for dragons.\n\nSadly, the war has taken its toll on the Stableside region. Many industrialists have fled, often taking significant assets and expertise with them, despite Daring Do's reassurance. Some loyalists followed them when my forces neared the city. And war being war, the local infrastructure and many of the factories have been badly damaged. As for the vital railways, they have been sabotaged and bombed into oblivion.\n\nIt will take time and effort to restore it all to greatness but I'm nothing if not persistent."
jungle.30.a:0 "I, Doctor Cabelleron, promise it!"

jungle.31.t:0 "A Stable Economy"
jungle.31.d:0 "Should you travel to Stableside these days, you'd be hard-pressed to remember that it used to be a war-area not too long ago. Mines are churning out minerals. Oil is flowing. Trains are chugging along. And once again, ships full of goods are leaving and entering the port. The well-oiled machine of Stableside seems unstoppable in its march to prosperity.\n\nBy continuing to invest in Stableside and making permanent my subsidies and tax breaks to the industry, I can kickstart a true industrial boom in Aztlan, one that could make it a continental powerhouse. Sadly, my budget is limited and if we pursue this road, many of my project in Tenochtitlan and Baltimare will have to remain limited. Some even point out that by doing this, I am only resuming Equestria's imperialist projects, betraying the promises I made to the natives. But that just might be the cost of peak industrial performance."
jungle.31.a:0 "There is no alternative."

jungle.32.t:0 "Among The Ruins Of Old Aztlan"
jungle.32.d:0 "Ah, Tenochtitlan. Immortal city of my heart. City of lakes and canals. But also a city of ruins... Truth be told, the jungles of Aztlan don't have much to offer. Centuries of Equestrian imperialism let an entire civilization be lost to the vines. But some like myself can see through the thick canopy and I see a land of opportunities and of virgin beauty. Something can be done here. Should. Must!"
jungle.32.a:0 "I, Doctor Cabelleron, promise it!"

jungle.33.t:0 "The Sun Rises Over Tenochtitlan"
jungle.33.d:0 "The Aztlan Revival is costly and many in Stableside and Baltimare are criticizing me for it. I still need a lot of resources to fulfill my promises to the Neighua. If I attain my objectives, the heart of the country will truly beat healthily again. Of course, it will mean that our industrialization will be somewhat slowed down in an age where everything is accelerating at neck-breaking speed. But if I don't, can the Neighua really wait for another chance at carving their place in the modern world? It is tempting for me to say yes. But what would that make me but a sellout? A very rich sellout..."
jungle.33.a:0 "Let the world hear at last of the Neighua!"

jungle.34.t:0 "The Cursed City"
jungle.34.d:0 "Baltimare is the most populated city in our new Aztlan. It is by far one of the most modern of our cities, being a part of the larger Equestrian east-coast. It even played a major role in bringing about the Equestrian industrial revolution thanks to its coal mines and natural harbour.\n\nYet, despite its strategic location on the Eclipse Gulf and natural advantages, it was always less favored by industrials and investors than her sister cities such as Manehattan or Fillydelphia. Some cities would have answered with apathy but the Baltimareans stood proud. They unionized and made do with what little they had. And when the civil war torn Equestria apart, they fought a revolution. While we ended up on opposite sides, I respect them for it. And under my rule, Baltimare won't be forgotten anymore."
jungle.34.a:0 "I, Doctor Cabelleron, promise it!"

jungle.35.t:0 "To Break The Curse of Baltimare"
jungle.35.d:0 "After my initial investments and reforms in Baltimare, it is beyond amazing how far that city has gone. To think that it took so little to build so much makes you wonder how much Equestria didn't care about that city. Maybe the revolutionaries there had a point after all...\n\nNow with continued investment and focused industrial planning, we can transform Baltimare into a major industrial center by the next decade. However, it will take massive resources but there is no way we can hope to invest them here and still pursue my more ambitious plans elsewhere. It is not without risks either. By focusing so strongly on the Baltimare region, we remain economically dependent on the greater east-equestrian region for our economy. The state of affairs in Equus being what they are, such a dependence could very well put us in a rough spot should Equestria's troubles deepen. Worse, it would leave the tribal regions and the whole Southeast in a state of continued underdevelopment.\n\nMaybe I cannot afford to break the Baltimare curse in the end but can I afford not to?"
jungle.35.a:0 "Set aside no more!"

JUN_doctor_desc:0 "Born in Puerto Caballo, Caballeron has long been a student of archeology, fascinated by the cultures, languages and history of southeastern Equestria. To fund his studies, he sold artifacts he found, sometimes to rather questionable individuals. This proved to be worth it as he eventually graduated with a Doctor's degree, despite Daring Do, his arch-nemesis, often trying to intervene and rescue the relics before he could sell them.\n\nAfter the Equestrian Civil War began, Caballeron used the wealth he had acquired from the sale of artifacts to hire mercenaries and drove out the Lunarist forces from the region around Tenochtitlan. He claims to be defending the natives, though some doubt if his motives are truly honest."
JUN_nice_doctor_desc:0 "Born in Puerto Caballo, Caballeron has long been a student of archeology, fascinated by the cultures, languages and history of southeastern Equestria.

This proved to be worth it as he eventually graduated with a Doctor's degree, despite Daring Do, his arch-nemesis, often trying to intervene and rescue the relics before he could sell them.\n\nAfter he founded the Aztlan State in the southeast, Caballeron has worked hard to create a free federation where everybody's rights are guaranteed. Despite his background, he has proven himself as an honest leader who genuinely cares for the natives. Thus he earned the trust of Equestria, much to the dismay of Daring Do."
JUN_rat_horse_desc:0 "A filly full of adventure and exploration, Sweet Water grew up without much of any supervision, going about at her heart's content. Be it swamp, jungle, desert, no climate was out of her reach growing up and volunteering in any situation or company or explorer's guild to get down and dirty.\n\nAt the appropriate age, enlisting in the Lunar Guard auxiliary and serving a short term doing essentially, nothing of significance walking tiled floor and great halls, she quickly became bored and as soon as her enlistment was to expire, she rucked it South to continue her exploring. Getting approached one day, with the opportunity to be highly paid and lead ponies and militias through the jungles by the infamous Caballeron, she quickly accepted.\n\nThe little swamp fox, the jungle rat as it were, would train her ponies and take them through thick and dirty and make them a feared jungle fighting force. All the while, getting to get very dirty and muddy in the process."
JUN_merc_pone_desc:0 "Born in the jungles far from the populated coastline in the South-East, Jungle Trek did not have a comfortable childhood. Far away from any schools or places of education, his father did his best to teach Jungle, and while he quickly learned basic subjects such as math, science and history, he was more interested in exploring the world and jungles around him.\n\nOnce he reached adulthood, though, Jungle quickly realized that he would need to get some sort of income to support himself. He worked several odd jobs before finally settling himself with a mercenary group, traveling all around Equestria and beyond for bits. Jungle quickly became known for his leadership qualities and was well liked by most of the other mercenaries, especially since the current captain was rather dull when it came to anything but fighting. Most in the group considered his death an inevitability, and the majority nominated Jungle to be the new leader when they passed.\n\nAfter becoming captain, Trek continued to travel the world, taking jobs ranging from fighting monsters to working as private armies for bits. While there isn't much he wouldn't do for gold, he wasn't below helping a fellow creature out for free if he thought they truly needed it. Having been hired by Caballeron just before the war broke out, Jungle now fights for Aztlan not only for the bits promised, but also for the cause that he believes is right."

JUN_selling_luxury_goods:0 "The Riches of Aztlan"
JUN_selling_luxury_goods_desc:0 "The jungles hold many riches, such as priceless artifacts and mineral veins, and war is a very costly affair. The natives won't appreciate being exploited as such, but they will understand the necessity."

JUN_codetalkers_idea:0 "The Huallauhatlatollamini"
JUN_codetalkers_idea_desc:0 "The dialects of the native jungle ponies are numerous and often incomprehensible. It makes for a perfect cypher."
JUN_codetalkers_idea_lar:0 "The Huallauhatlatollamini"

JUN_army_of_aztlan_idea_desc:0 "The ponies of Aztlan stand proudly in the defence of their homes."
JUN_night_fliers_idea:0 "Night Fliers"
JUN_night_fliers_idea_desc:0 "It is a risky endeavour to fly during the night, but many natives are quite used to the dark, and navigate through it with ease. Their performance is rather impressive."
JUN_expert_fliers_idea:0 "The Sons Of Quetzalcoatl"
JUN_expert_fliers_idea_desc:0 "The winds are ever favoured for the followers of Quetzalcoatl. They fly higher and better compared to the rest, although it is hard to say if it's genuine skill or suicidal overconfidence."
JUN_admirality_idea:0 "The Aztlan Admiralty"
JUN_admirality_idea_desc:0 "The newly formed Admiralty handles all the matters of the sea, and provides crucial funding for the development of new seafaring vessels."
JUN_lunar_remnants:0 "Lunar Remnants"
JUN_lunar_remnants_desc:0 "We have defeated them, the Nightmare Moon supporters. Yet, even in defeat, they lurk about in the dark, unwilling to accept defeat. We'll need to take steps to reconcile ourselves with the bat ponies and repress those who won't give up violence."
JUN_discontent_in_cities:0 "Discontent In The Cities"
JUN_discontent_in_cities_desc:0 "The civil war may have ended, but the animosity between common ponies has not waned in the slightest. Addressing this issue should be one of our first concerns, lest we suffer a second revolt."
JUN_economic_backwater:0 "Economic Devastation"
JUN_economic_backwater_desc:0 "The Equestrian southeast was already amongst the least developed regions in Equestria, but the civil war has ruined what little industry that already existed. The ruling government must enact quick measures to restore civilisation and modernity."
JUN_economic_backwater_2:0 "Economic Devastation"
JUN_economic_backwater_2_desc:0 "The Equestrian southeast was already amongst the least developed regions in Equestria, but the civil war has ruined what little industry that already existed. The ruling government must enact quick measures to restore civilisation and modernity. Recent development has alleviated this problem to some extent, however."
JUN_daring_propaganda:0 "Daring Do's Propaganda War"
JUN_daring_propaganda_desc:0 "Daring Do has been defeated militarily, but she remains committed to toppling our government in general, and Caballeron specifically. Through propaganda and speeches, she is stirring up discontent against Dr. Caballeron. This must be stopped."
JUN_daring_propaganda_2:0 "Daring Do's Suspicion"
JUN_daring_propaganda_2_desc:0 "While less active now, Daring Do is still utterly convinced Caballeron is up to something nefarious, and continues to denounce his legitimate administration regularly."
JUN_stableside_primacy_idea:0 "Stableside Primacy"
JUN_stableside_primacy_idea_desc:0 "Our development focus has become the rich port city of Stableside, the gateway to Zebrica and many islands which produce lucrative crops. It is also a good location to centralise our arms import programs, as well."
JUN_tourism_idea:0 "The Aztlan Tourism Industry"
JUN_tourism_idea_desc:0 "With peace reigning once more, Dr. Caballeron has enacted one of his ideas to establish tourist destinations both on the shores and in the jungles of Aztlan. As long as any visitors do not mind the heat, they'll be having the time of their lives! The natives, however, do not appreciate being gawked at, nor having their culture misappropriated."
JUN_tourism_2_idea:0 "The Aztlan Tourism Industry"
JUN_tourism_2_idea_desc:0 ""Come see the wonders of Aztlan! Have the time of your lives!\n\n(please do not agitate the native ponies)""
JUN_technochitlan_primacy_idea:0 "Tenochtitlan Primacy"

JUN_baltimare_primacy_idea:0 "Baltimare Primacy"
JUN_baltimare_primacy_idea_desc:0 "Our development focus has become the industrial city of Baltimare, which was relatively preserved during the many battles of the civil war. The machinery present there will allow us to copy their designs and implement them to other cities across the southeast, so that everypony can enjoy modernity."
JUN_peace_in_our_time_idea:0 "The Southern Beacon"
JUN_peace_in_our_time_idea_desc:0 "Despite many difficulties and setbacks, Dr. Caballeron has fulfilled his visioned and brought lasting peace and stability to southeastern Equestria. Ponies, thestrals and natives now live in harmony together, and remark that life has never been better than now."
JUN_discontent_in_cities_2:0 "Discontent In The Cities"
JUN_discontent_in_cities_2_desc:0 "The civil war may have ended, but the animosity between common ponies has not waned in the slightest. Addressing this issue should be one of our first concerns, lest we suffer a second revolt."

### Focuses ###
JUN_decleration:0 "Stuck in a Strange Land"
JUN_decleration_desc:0 "Due to unforeseen circumstances it seems that I am in fact stuck running a country, in the middle of a jungle filled with dangerous fauna, flora, tribals, crazy cultists and annoying adventurers... but if I play my cards right perhaps I can still turn a profit here. For Freedom, Country, and Money! Mostly money."
JUN_shield_the_skies:0 "Some Ramshackle AA Guns"
JUN_shield_the_skies_desc:0 "It's very annoying when planes fly overhead, strafing or bombing us. While we don't have the resources for a widespread adoption, a few guns pointed towards the sky over Tenochtilan would go a long way."
JUN_we_need_a_port:0 "Expand the Saltmane Port"
JUN_we_need_a_port_desc:0 "Saltmane Coast is a splendid territory, but our enterprise requires more than simple jungles and beaches for our war efforts. We shall turn this area into our primary port, to protect ourselves from sea threats as well as project our own naval power."
JUN_we_need_the_guns:0 "Call In A Few Favours"
JUN_we_need_the_guns_desc:0 "The instability we face is not one to be taken lightly. Our assets are low, our stance, feeble. However, it will soon change. In my numerous adventures and operations, I have made plenty of friends and connections. It's time to call in some old debts..."
JUN_we_need_even_more:0 "The Riches of Aztlan"
JUN_we_need_even_more_desc:0 "This land is rich with goods and treasures, we need only be able to excavate them. I, Caballeron, demand quarries to be developed, and lands will be razed and trees be cut. The resources are everywhere, and they will be ours."
JUN_the_wealth_of_the_jungle:0 "The Spirit of Adventure Incarnate"
JUN_the_wealth_of_the_jungle_desc:0 "Aztlan is a land of opportunity and adventure, with plenty of names to be made, whirlwind romances to be had, and riches to seize. It is the place to be if you dare to live life to the fullest! And to get rich along the way. Come to Aztlan and make your fortune!"
JUN_dedicated_smugglers:0 "Blockade Runners"
JUN_dedicated_smugglers_desc:0 "They think they can contain us in here, limit our income. This territory is ours now, and we'll use it to our advantage. Let's show them who controls these jungles, and who can smuggle through them better."
JUN_fortify_technochitlan:0 "Rebuild The Walls Of Tenochtitlan"
JUN_fortify_technochitlan_desc:0 "Tenochtitlan was once a fortress, an impenetrable bastion with great walls which none could surmount. We must rebuild them, which will provide us with a strategic standpoint and a defensive position, should such need arise. And perhaps, the locals will feel more accepting of our presence here."
JUN_reuse_the_ruins:0 "Repurpose the Ruins"
JUN_reuse_the_ruins_desc:0 "The Ruins here are old, crumbling, but they can still provide a solid foundation. We shall repurpose them for our own needs, build our structures upon the ancient land! Now there will be a stronghold raised here in no time."
JUN_repair_the_cannals:0 "Repair The Canals"
JUN_repair_the_cannals_desc:0 "Rivers are a fickle landmark, wild and unpredictable, but if we can tame it, it will become our advantage. Repair the old canals, so that the water will provide us with resources, the river will become our line of transport and the shores will be our enemies' nightmare."
JUN_food_surplus:0 "Stock The Pantries"
JUN_food_surplus_desc:0 "Our supplies come steadily and surely, it is time to replenish our stocks. Load the pantries, let none of our supplies perish, or worse, get into our enemies' clutches. There will always be a good use for it later, our ponies will need it."
JUN_the_old_road:0 "Repair The Ohtli System"
JUN_the_old_road_desc:0 "So many things in here are still in half-decent state. They may not be of good use right now, but if we are to invest into renovations of these roads and structures, our infrastructure will flourish, just as these jungles do."
JUN_secondary_forts:0 "Raise The Towers"
JUN_secondary_forts_desc:0 "With all the elements I put in place, we're still exposed and scattered among these woods. Raise the towers! Our sight will span far and wide, none shall take us by surprise! These fortified constructions will bestow upon us a gratifying sense of security."
JUN_repair_the_temple:0 "Repair the Tonaltzintli Pyramid"
JUN_repair_the_temple_desc:0 "The culture and architecture of these locals is fascinating, the Tonaltzintli Pyramid is a prime example of an excellent edifice of the Neighua tribe. Though turned to a decrepit state with time, this temple may return to its former glory yet. May it inspire us well and provide refuge from the raging war. My only hope is that the chiefs can share my enthusiasm."
JUN_basic_manufacturies:0 "Tenochtitlan Manufacturies"
JUN_basic_manufacturies_desc:0 "With all the progress I've made to develop the framework here, the time has come to move to the next level. Our capital requires better factories, better production. We can finally set up a progressive manufacturing base here, the likes of which this land has not yet seen before."
JUN_basic_saw_mills:0 "Logging Camps"
JUN_basic_saw_mills_desc:0 "The jungles have no shortage of wood. Yet to harvest it more effectively, we need better tools and groundwork to support such activities. Build more sawmills, our logging camps will yield materials to the brim, and we shall never run out of fine wood again!"
JUN_win_them_over:0 "Meet With The Natives"
JUN_win_them_over_desc:0 "Perhaps these locals can be of use to us. After all, they're the natives here, it would be foolish to fight against them and not alongside them. We must organise a meeting, I know a way into their heart, there is a chance that they will listen to me."
JUN_my_old_rival:0 "My Old Rival"
JUN_my_old_rival_desc:0 "Daring Do, we have clashed time and again! But this time will be my victory at last. I will defeat your foolish little "Resistance" and proclaim my Provisional Government triumphant. I swear this on... well, there isn't much I believe in, but I assure you it's a very sincere proclamation!"
JUN_hearts_and_minds:0 "Hearts And Minds"
JUN_hearts_and_minds_desc:0 "We must further our relationship with the Neighua. A fight for survival can unite anyone, and this is our chance. They may be dangerous, but if we sway them to our side, our cause, the dangers they present can become our tactical advantage."
JUN_borne_of_the_jungle:0 "Borne Of The Dark"
JUN_borne_of_the_jungle_desc:0 "With our agreements in place, our newfound allies entrusted us some of their best and most trained warriors. It is a great honour, and an opportunity that we must cherish. I welcome them, our partners will thrive, and our enemies will learn to fear these jungles."
JUN_bury_them_here:0 "Masters Of The Jungle"
JUN_bury_them_here_desc:0 "Our partnership allowed us to learn these territories in their greatest details. Every nook and cranny that these locals have lived among for ages, their secrets, are now part of our intelligence. Ultimately, it seems this ally has become our greatest asset yet."
JUN_the_chosen:0 "Chosen By The Gods"
JUN_the_chosen_desc:0 "Their culture is a curious one. Odd, but has its uses, perhaps I underestimated them. They wish to offer us to be chosen by the Gods. Such tales are quaint, but the ferocity and cunning of these ponies is undeniable. We shall take them on their offer, it is bound to help our relationship in the future."
JUN_the_final_push:0 "Fight For Aztlan"
JUN_the_final_push_desc:0 "After all we've gone through, I never gave up, we never gave up, and never will. These jungles were a dangerous place, full of perils on every step. They still are, but thanks to our allies, it is only our enemies that see them as such. The Neighua and their culture, their knowledge, is part of our own now. We are free, and this is our land now, we will fight for it as if it were our own. Now, we are home. For Aztlan!"

JUN_army_debate:0 "The Milchimalli"
JUN_army_debate_desc:0 "At last Aztlan is free from Equestrian imperialism but it would be foolish for us to expect it to stand forever out of sheer international goodwill. To make sure our independence isn't snuffed out like so many others in history, we will need to build a military. I'll make sure that anypony entering this jungle with hostile intentions will never come out of it."
JUN_equestrian_tactics:0 "Lessons From The Equestrians"
JUN_equestrian_tactics_desc:0 "Aztlan has freed itself from the Equestrian yoke. But despite our success, we remain woefully behind in terms of pony warfare and much of it comes either from ancestral and obsolete traditions or from adventurers. If we are to truly build an army, we need to study military theory and tactics. And the easiest one to learn from is the Equestrian doctrine."
JUN_trucks:0 "Adopt the Jackalope"
JUN_trucks_desc:0 "Logistics have been one of the most important aspect of warfare throughout history and one the native tribes have been truly apt at. However, modern warfare poses challenges that are simply impossible to overcome with our traditions. Our engineers have repurposed some Sicameonese all-terrain trucks to be jungle-ready, calling it the Jackalope. Let's adopt it to bolster our supply lines."
JUN_new_rifles:0 "Standardise Rifle Models"
JUN_new_rifles_desc:0 "Our soldiers use a variety of weapons acquired through all kinds of ways since the early days of the independence war. This has produced a logistical nightmare for our forces. We need to standardise our guns as soon as possible. If we fail to do so, whole divisions may be stuck on the frontline without ammunition or working rifle to fire at the enemy."
JUN_sturdy_shovels:0 "Dedicated Support Squads"
JUN_sturdy_shovels_desc:0 "Jungle warfare is a deeply complex affair, one where fortification can be a tremendous asset in combat but one that is strategically difficult to use. However, our military staff has combined experience from our native tribes and the various adventurers I brought in. Together, they have designed a doctrine for a mobile Engineer Corps, able to provide infrastructure and fortification in a moment's notice."
JUN_light_tanks_f:0 "The Chimalli"
JUN_light_tanks_f_desc:0 "Our jungles are a terrain hostile to mobile warfare but through careful adaptation of imported tankette, we have learned ways to use mechanized vehicles in them. The result of these experiments is the newly designed Chimalli light tank, a small but highly sturdy tank. There still won't be glorious mechanized charges through the trees but surgical use of the Chimalli will prove devastating on the battlefield."
JUN_new_artillery:0 "Aztlan Artillery Corps"
JUN_new_artillery_desc:0 "Anypony who has ever fought in a jungle knows how devastating and confusing a well-placed shell can be. But any artillery officer who has fought in a jungle can tell you how difficult it is to maintain proper artillery in that kind of terrain, let alone moving it around effectively. But it will be well worth the effort, if only to have the Equestrians and foreigners get a taste of their own medicine."
JUN_new_officers:0 "Scour The Jungles For Talent"
JUN_new_officers_desc:0 "Despite our recruitment binge since the independence, our military staff is still severely lacking. I'll send headhunters throughout the jungles to seek talent among the native tribes and equestrian frontier settlements. They are bound to find tactically minded ponies fit for leadership."
JUN_train_them:0 "Put Them Through Tartarus"
JUN_train_them_desc:0 "Some nations have the luxury to build up slowly. We do not. Aztlan's birth was a painful and bloody affair. What I need are warriors that can take on any threat in a moment's notice. For this purpose, we will put our recruits through the most gruesome of training regiment. Those who will come out of the jungle after it will be formidable warriors. The others will have done their duty."
JUN_adapt_to_the_jungle:0 "Born Out Of The Jungle"
JUN_adapt_to_the_jungle_desc:0 "While a great deal of our soldiers are of Neighua heritage and know how to live in a jungle environment, many of our recruits do not, especially those coming from the coastal cities of Aztlan. To remedy this, a special training program has been instituted to send recruits deep into the Aztlan interior under native and veterans leadership to learn how to survive, move and fight in the jungle."
JUN_sapper_tactics:0 "Sapper Tactics"
JUN_sapper_tactics_desc:0 "The jungle is a tricky terrain, one which to the unprepared soldier, is as much if not more dangerous than the enemy itself. Neighua hunters have long learned to become trickier themselves and became experts in trap making. We can apply this to the way we wage war and formalize it to gain an edge over our enemies, most of whom have never seen much beyond welcoming woods."
JUN_nastive_tactics:0 "Lessons Of The Jungle"
JUN_nastive_tactics_desc:0 "While some argue for standardization of our army, it is undeniable that Aztlan's military situation is unique. As such, rather than pursuing unsuitable tactics, we should develop our own form of warfare. We have a long native tradition to draw from, as well as from my own companions. Foreign expertise is welcome but should come from more relevant places such as Puerto Caballo, Sicameon or Zebrica."
JUN_codetalkers:0 "The Huallauhatlatollamini"
JUN_codetalkers_desc:0 "Neighua dialects are by all accounts obscure languages. While it is highly disappointing when it comes to our cultural radiance worldwide, it may be a military asset. Enemies who intercept our messages would be hard pressed to gain any intel from them if they lack even a basic dictionary. We will take steps to assign communications tasks to Neighua soldiers or educate our officers in those dialects."
JUN_integrate_bat_units:0 "Integrate The Tzinacatl Divisions"
JUN_integrate_bat_units_desc:0 "For a long time now, our Neighua military staff has bitterly opposed allowing bat ponies in our military. This is a costly policy, one that could cost us victories in the bloody years to come. My contacts among the Tzinacatl do show that they are willing to serve Aztlan and are even eager to. It will take all my charm to convince the Neighuas and move forward but it is an investment well worth my time and effort."
JUN_officer_schools:0 "Officer Schools"
JUN_officer_schools_desc:0 "Despite the tireless work of my headhunters, we cannot hope to continue relying on gifted locals to lead our armies. We need to invest resources in opening officer schools in our settlements and educate the next generation of Aztlanian officers. We'll bring in foreign officers with a more orthodox military education. Equestrian defectors have already shown interests, as well as contacts in Sicameon and Puerto Caballo."
JUN_electronics_military:0 "Adopt the RADAR"
JUN_electronics_military_desc:0 "Waging war effectively always require information but the newly invented RADAR technology has transformed the ways one can acquire tactical information. It will require electrification and significant investment either in infrastructure or adapted vehicles but it will pay off in the long run."
JUN_spec_ops_department:0 "Special Forces Department"
JUN_spec_ops_department_desc:0 "During the war of independence, the Tzinacatl have proven to be vicious and stealthy warriors and in many cases, they have humbled even our best soldiers. We can harness their expertise in specialized units where only the best will serve."
JUN_army_of_aztlan:0 "The Protectors of Aztlan"
JUN_army_of_aztlan_desc:0 "Aztlan has long known woes of all kind. Our independence was stolen from us when we were betrayed by our god. No more. Aztlan now stands free. There may be war. There may be burning. Lives will be lost. But in the end, our enemies shall flee and our victorious soldiers will find their way home, to Tenochtitlan."

JUN_aztlan_airforce:0 "The Aztlan Airforce"
JUN_aztlan_airforce_desc:0 "When the Aztlanians used to look up in the sky, they would see nothing but Equestrian pegasi, Equestrian planes or the dreaded dragons. If I really want to safeguard our independence and control over the jungles, I'll need to build an airforce."
JUN_import_fighters:0 "Import Fighter Craft"
JUN_import_fighters_desc:0 "Aztlan as it stands doesn't have much in terms of planes in its airfield. If we are to dominate our own sky, we won't do it with repurposed civilian planes and repaired downed equestrian planes. I know some sellers back in Griffonia who can sell us some fighters for an honest price."
JUN_light_aircraft:0 "The Quetzalcoatl"
JUN_light_aircraft_desc:0 "Ever since creatures conquered the sky without magic or their own wings, the ponies of Aztlan only got to see foreign planes flying over their heads, whether it was Equestrian military planes or Aerobats trying to set records. But those days are behind us now that one of my engineer has put together plans for an entirely Aztlanian fighter plane: the Quetzacoatl."
JUN_CAS_f:0 "The Cuitlatlotli"
JUN_CAS_f_desc:0 "Warfare in the Southeast has been mostly land-based, with planes fighting their own war. But many of my pilots have proven to be anxious to help our soldiers on the ground. As a result, many have been sanctioned for dangerous low-altitude actions but many are calling to put them to use instead. I'll get these crazy heroes some appropriate planes!"
JUN_import_bombers:0 "Import Bomber Craft"
JUN_import_bombers_desc:0 "Using our planes to prevent hostile bombers from wrecking our forces and infrastructure is a desirable goal but it leaves so much potential unexplored. Through contacts in Sicameon, we have found opportunities to import our very own bombers. It's time that we are able to turn tables on our enemies."
JUN_bomber_aircraft:0 "The Cuauhtli"
JUN_bomber_aircraft_desc:0 "Importing Bombers has allowed us to bolster our airforce but it is a costly and unreliable source. Our engineer have studied the model and through some retro engineering, they have come up with a new model, one that can be built locally at a much cheaper cost."
JUN_heavier_bombers:0 "The Tepopoloani"
JUN_heavier_bombers_desc:0 "Tactical bombing is all well and good but our engineers have pushed forward a new concept, one that is revolutionizing warfare throughout the world: long-range bombing. No more will war in the Southeast be a distant affair read about in the ninth page of the newspaper for our bombers will bring war to our enemies' home."
JUN_build_the_airstrips:0 "Construct the Airstrips"
JUN_build_the_airstrips_desc:0 "One of the most significant issue we are still facing today is the lack of airfields in Aztlan. The old airstrips on the coast have served their purpose but they are not enough. Our pilots still dread any issue when flying over our own jungle heartland. We need to take steps so our cities are connected to our airways."
JUN_train_the_pilots:0 "Train The Pilots"
JUN_train_the_pilots_desc:0 "My airforce has seen significant improvement since its early days. However, my pilot corps still leaves to be desired. Even by the kindest terms, it remains a ragtag bunch of adventurers, unreliable defectors and self-taught pilots who managed to survive. While I can appreciate that sort of things, we can't expect to rely on them much longer. It is time to establish a standardized training program for our recruits and to create a proper air academy."
JUN_heavier_fighters:0 "The Tepoz Cuauhtli"
JUN_heavier_fighters_desc:0 "Even with our investments in airfields, the Southeast remains a difficult place to fly over. Many a good pilot has been lost to the jungle or mechanical failure due to exhausted engines. As sturdy our Quetzacoatls are, we can only push them so far. Our military staff and engineers have issued a plan for a new kind of heavy fighter: the Tepoz Cuauhtli. With it, they say, true air superiority is achievable."
JUN_night_fliers:0 "Night Fliers"
JUN_night_fliers_desc:0 "Since times immemorial, Aztlanians have known the value of hunting in the night. Let us put that martial tradition to use in the air! May our enemies experience the terrors of the night in Aztlan..."
JUN_expert_fliers:0 "Children Of Quetzalcoatl"
JUN_expert_fliers_desc:0 ""Look up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It IS a plane! And that plane belongs to the Aztlan Airforce!""

JUN_aztlan_navy:0 "The Aztlan Navy"
JUN_aztlan_navy_desc:0 "For centuries, Aztlan has been denied free access to the sea but now that we are free from Equestrian imperialism, we may begin to work on a navy and truly open ourselves to the world."
JUN_baltimare_port:0 "The Baltimare Dockyards"
JUN_baltimare_port_desc:0 "The dockyards in Baltimare have been one of the most important ones in the southeast. Sadly, they have been badly damaged when we wrestled control over the city from the revolutionaries. With some repairs, this symbol of equestrian naval power may become one for Aztlan."
JUN_stableside_port:0 "The Stableside Dockyards"
JUN_stableside_port_desc:0 "Stableside is one of the few cities in the Southeast that has an actual industrial capacity, and the only coastal one at that. As such, it is home to many civilian dockyards but with some investment from our part, we could transform it into a major military harbour. Without those investments, the dream of an Aztlanian navy will remain just that."
JUN_destroyer_f:0 "The Aztlan Coast Guard"
JUN_destroyer_f_desc:0 "Equus' southeastern coast is a dangerous place. Pirates and privateers are no rarity and dragons flying over from their isles often cause chaos in naval activities. Establishing a Coast Guard will allow us to begin establishing some order. I probably should tip off some of my friends about this."
JUN_light_cruiser_f:0 "Heavier Plating"
JUN_light_cruiser_f_desc:0 "Small destroyers and repurposed civilian ships will only take us so far in creating a navy. We need to invest in cruisers able to withstand prolonged combat. At first, we may use them as command ships for our coastal fleets but in the years to come, they will be a significant asset to support our larger ships."
JUN_saltmane_port:0 "The Saltmane Dockyards"
JUN_saltmane_port_desc:0 "Baltimare and Stableside are serving their purpose as naval bases but their position on our periphery is hurting our naval capabilities. Meanwhile, our strategically placed coastal city of Saltmane is severely lacking in naval infrastructure. By aggressively investing there, we can finally link up our northern and southwestern navies and facilitate communication between our naval staff and Tenochtitlan."
JUN_submarine_f:0 "The Hidden Navy"
JUN_submarine_f_desc:0 "Even with heavy investments, it will take a long time for Aztlan to have a navy capable of withstanding direct contact. However, we are no stranger to asymmetrical warfare and fighting stronger forces. Let us take into account the lessons of our land warfare history and apply them to our naval plans. Our submarines shall lurk under the sea until we are ready for more orthodox forms of naval combat."
JUN_heavy_cruiser_f:0 "Light Battleships"
JUN_heavy_cruiser_f_desc:0 "Our dockyards have proven to be surprisingly adaptable to our growing demands on building and maintaining warships. The reports on our cruiser experiments have demonstrated that they are ready for heavier experiments. As a result, our naval engineers have put forward a plan to create a light battleship, the first one to be named the Caballeron, in my honor."
JUN_doctrianl_development:0 "Doctrinal Development"
JUN_doctrianl_development_desc:0 "Despite our progress, our naval staff is still a mess composed of Baltimarean defectors and sailor friends of mine. This has lead my navy to function without a proper doctrine. We need to sort out the doctrinal debate and fix ourselves some objectives about how my navy is to operate. Aztlan's independence may very well depend on it."
JUN_battleship_f:0 "The War Navy"
JUN_battleship_f_desc:0 "As it stands, Aztlan is a small power still but the seas are merciless where the weak are swept aside. If we are to exist as a naval power, we need a true true war navy, one that will be lead by true fortresses of the seas. It will be a difficult and long endeavour but if I do not take steps towards this end now, Aztlan shall never be safe, let alone powerful on the world stage."
JUN_carrier_f:0 "Carrier Experiments"
JUN_carrier_f_desc:0 "Anypony sailing in the Southeast has already witnessed a dragon flying over them. This has lead many of my naval officers to understand early on the potential and power of air power applied to naval warfare. This has lead to many early designs for carrier ships, most of which were utterly unattainable for our meager naval capabilities. With our newly acquired experience and infrastructure, we can attempt to build a sea-worthy prototype."

From there, my admirals can work on our dream of seeing one day Aztlan rule the waves."

The dangers of budget balancing are not as thrilling as those of a jungle trek but there is no less urgency in it. As it stands, Aztlan is more of a cobbled-together mess of three barely connected regions than a united nation. Worse, all three of them have been left devastated by war and bad Equestrian policies. Choices will have to be made and with the state of our treasury, they won't be easy ones."

Some Hoofington industrialists had begun to try and tap into it but the civil war put the lid on that.

Without access to the Severyanian production, Equestria has been forced to rely on Olenian and foreign imports. Lucky for us, a geologist found traces of bauxite in the Sirius region.

There is no glamour or beauty in the rubber business but it pays and a modern world requires a lot of it.

Those greedy bastards would bleed this jungle dry if left unchecked."

However, statecraft is a costly business when one won't exploit resources put at his disposal. I cannot save this land at large but I can preserve much of it.

jungle.1.d:0 "As anarchy found its home in the southeast with the upheaval of Celestial and Communist revolts against the Lunar administration, a strange figure found itself landing on the port of Saltmane and quickly making their way into the city of Tenochtitlan. A stallion called Caballeron, who insisted on the title of Doctor being used to refer to him, followed by bands of ponies, changelings and griffons, all heavily armed and seemingly ready to be set loose at any moment. The stallion had gone into the local administration building followed by the chief of Saltmane, an hour passing with the city in a tense standstill, a single thought echoing throughout the minds and behind the walls of the residents of the city of the sun: "What's gonna happen?"\n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, the doctor left the building accompanied by the local administrator and some Neighua chiefs, their laughs and smiles contrasted by the expressionless faces of the armed folk and the tense brows of all locals, time frozen until -\n\n"People of the sun! Freedom has come to you today! I, Doctor Caballeron, have come to free you from Lunar subservience and Equestrian neglect! Share the news to your neighbor, it has been too long, with you... suffering! Join me and suffer no longer!"\n\nThe local administrator and the chiefs did not seem to react badly of these absurd words screamed into the skies, even clapping and shouting for others to join them, some feeling pressured and others taken by the fervorous wave that soon took over the town. As the locals ran to spread these news, the doctor spoke into a radio for his soldier to hear.\n\n"Hostile takeover will not be needed, we can proceed as normal," a smile forming as he stashed it back into his bag."

A hungry people meant no morale and no trust; a hungry army meant death. Caballeron could not let this become a problem.\n\nAs ships arrived at Saltmane Harbor, Caballeron ordered his close guard to assist with unloading their contents into the trucks he had prepared for this. Crates and crates of grain, enough to fill up the granaries for a few months, while it was not the most luxurious meal, it would be enough for the people to keep on living, the thought bringing him a smile… Caballeron put a hoof over his mouth, surprised. He… felt good about helping others?\n\nAs the trucks prepared to leave for the capital, he quickly hopped on one of them, but these thoughts would not leave him. Why would he care about these jungles? They were just a way for him to make as many bits as possible so he could fund his research… it was a stepping stone, nothing more. As he looked out the windows, a lake could be seen in the distance, with playing foals and adults alike, as if no pain had found its way to this land. Caballeron closed the window down and looked straight ahead at the dirt road."

He could have never expected things to have gone this way even in his wildest dreams, no longer known as just a goon for Daring Do to face in her latest adventure, but as a symbol of hope for all the Neighua and other tribesfolk under Aztlan. He took one last deep breath and-\n\n"To all that live in the Southeast, be they Neighua, Coltec, Mareyan, or whatever denomination you fall upon, you have a place here! We have walked great strides to free this land from the colonial rule of Equestria and have kept it safe from those that wish to exploit it once more, such as the Nightmare followers wishing to enslave you to a mad goddess, ponies hiding under a veil of communism to do purges of their own people in Baltimare, or Daring Do, wishing to forevermore tie this land to a government that does not care for your plight! I say no more! The Southeast will never again be slaves! Never again be forgotten! After we have all fought and bled for this land, how could we give it up?!" The crowd erupted into cheers, Caballeron allowing them to chant his name a while longer before continuing.\n\n"Under these principles of freedom that have shaped our battles, I wish to make one further announcement today. Once the fighting is done, I will proclaim this land as a true nation; a federation to stand proud on Equus! Once that is done, we will work together with all! Be they communist or lunarist, all who have not committed crimes too great against our people will have a chance to redeem themselves! Long live Aztlan!"\n\nAs the crowds cheered, Caballeron thought of how easy it was to get people to trust you if you just spew some honeyed words. Well, it also felt a bit good to be seen as a hero."

He sneaked through some foliage to get a better look upon these devilish bats as to warn the chief of how many marched.\n\nAs Akanti got a better look, the creatures seemed to be led by a pony, but they appeared to be... griffons? There were no bats in sign as the griffons filled a truck with gems upon gems, another truck, already stashed with many boxes beside it. How could they?! These temples were sacred and so were the gems there, this was a horrible thing to do... but what could he do? He was a lone pony seeing as dozens of armed creatures ransacked and destroyed their heritage, his people's story...\n\nThe torture seemed to finally give break, as the pony and a rather well-off looking griff shook hoof and claw, the truck with the gems taking off as the truck with the boxes was left behind. The pony seemed to smile and order the other griffons to open them up as he left towards the jungle. Akanti kept a close look as to ascertain whatever was in those boxes, it could be valuable information for the tribe to have.\n\nAs the boxes were opened, one of them reached out and grabbed a... rifle? As dozens of others went to look... that was it? They had stolen from sacred lands for what? Weapons?! Did they know nothing about the importance of those gems? Were they simply misguided?

"Yes... but there is a need for more guns this time."\n\nThe griffon took a sip of some drink he had brought, not really focused on what Caballeron was talking about.

The last time they had done business, it was also for gems. He got some of his soldiers to raid a broken down temple a few miles from Ixtapan, it all went well, except... the kid. He had seen shadows and foliage moving in the distance while his mercs brought the guns, he wouldn't have gotten so far facing Daring Do if he wasn't attentive, still, he was glad to be the one to have spotted him and not one of the griffs. Once he found himself behind the pony, he noticed it was just a foal—scared, angry, saddened, all feelings amplified by youth... it reminded him of his early days studying archeology, the sadness he felt by having to put a price in such priceless pieces; the anger he felt from his first encounter with Daring Do; that deep fear the first time face to face with Ahuizotl... all things that foal had to face at once due to his... his...\n\n"Doctor? Are you there?" Caballeron snapping awake as he noticed the griffon snapping his claws at him. Yes, right. The deal. They still needed guns to keep the fight going, this fight he had taken upon himself to see to the end."

Many warriors of Ixtapan have already joined you, if even more are mobilized it will mean losing strong hoofs at the tribe. If they do not return, it could very well ruin our balance." The other chiefs seemed to agree, all voicing their concerns towards this hasty mobilization.\n\nCaballeron kept his smile as they talked, nodding along to the conversation until all went quiet. "Yes, yes, I do understand. Trust me, I do not wish for needless suffering to come to your lives, it is why I have chosen to help you, no? Frankly, it is... discouraging, knowing you come to help others out of the goodness of your heart, yet, they refuse to acknowledge your sacrifice." Caballeron sighed, "That creature must be a sad sad one, thankfully I am not them. I have understood your woes, so I will not ask for so many warriors."\n\nThe chiefs seemed relieved. "Of course! So it will be done like this, you will send half of the previously proposed amount of warriors and half the amount of non-warriors." The chiefs looked to Caballeron aghast, with him quickly amending, "This way... balance is kept, no? With half warriors and half non warriors, there is no risk of ruining your balance. Do not worry! They will be quickly trained by my folk how to use guns." Caballeron smiled. "You have my word, every death will be memorialized as a hero of our freedom. You should get to it soon, it would be a tragedy if more died due to lack of support, no?"\n\nAs the chiefs left the room, Caballeron couldn't help but feel proud of getting his way done while running circles around them."

The chief spoke with a cloth-covered body behind him, his stoic face betrayed by his sad eyes. "Quitzá  lived and died as a true child of the Sun. Taken by surprise by the underhandedness of the bat warriors, she still fought bravely and died a warrior's death." It was directly because of Caballeron's choices that she had died, being one of the warriors conscripted after his edict to mobilize more creatures. He did not expect to have to see this, much less to be invited here to participate in such private rituals. "Alongside us today is Doctor Caballeron, he will give his words as was promised." The chief stepped down and made way for Caballeron to take their place. Taken by surprise but never one to freeze upon headlights, Caballeron found himself standing in front of hundreds of Neighua, some looking upon him with disdain, all with sadness in their eyes.\n\n"I thank you all for giving me this... opportunity." He had nothing prepared, nothing left to do but go for it. "I did not know of Quitzá personally like many of you do; I never got to ask for their help or hear their laugh. However, I do know of one thing... She perished as a soldier of Aztlan. She died fighting for a belief... a belief of a free land, one where Neighua could live in peace, equal and safe. While she died fighting the night, we allow her to pass through the veil as a true child of the Sun." As his speech went on, oil was dropped upon the cloth covering her body, and a torch was handed to Caballeron. "We witness not just death, but her new beginning, as the flame I share with her shall bring her your gifts, tears, and prayers to follow her as she journeys on."\n\nAs he dropped the torch and the flames sprang from the burning body, he looked back to the crowd, the faces of anger gone, with only sorrow and their fiery spirits remaining. "WE FIGHT ON, NOT JUST FOR AZTLAN, BUT FOR QUITZÁ! LONG LIVE AZTLAN! LONG LIVE QUITZÁ!" Lost in the quickly growing fervor, he failed to notice the tears spilling from his eyes."

What about after that? Demands and expectations were piling up, both figuratively and literally, as illustrated by the mountain of papers he still had to deal with... or did he? He did promise to work towards reintegrating and giving a stage to all the voices in his federation... What better way to do that than by getting a right-hoof to stand by his side. Works as a showcase of wanting unity and to move past the past, but more importantly, allows him to shove all this bureaucracy into someone else's lap while he can focus on what really matters: smiling for the cameras!"

As Golden attempted to speak up to defend his choice, the factory door slowly creaked open, making a large noise that got the attention of everyone. A head popped out, revealing none other than– "Caballeron?! Our meeting was supposed to be three hours from now at my office, how did you even get here?"\n\nCaballeron strode towards the group. "Why, I must have gotten to the wrong location! Such a silly mistake." His reactions over the top, a grin plastered on his face. "Although... now that I am here, it would be best to get our talks underway." With CAN's members at their wits' end and TER not far behind, it was only Golden's composure that kept them all at bay.

'unions,' they can stay in the federation I'm creating. Political aspects are still to be decided, but... allowing the workers to organize is my sign of respect to you. All I ask is for less rabblerousing in the cities... until we can better decide the terms." The workers watched, silent, gauging the two stallions in a standoff.\n\nGolden extended a hoof towards Caballeron. "While there is still much to be desired, constitutional recognition of our rights to strike and unionize is a good enough step for now. You have my word that CAN and TER will respect this agreement.

Daring Do has a way with words and manipulation, I do not blame any of you for standing by her side during the war." He flashed a charming smile. "What I hope now is that we can put all this bad blood behind us, and that like the sun, a new dawn will wash over us. As one would say... Chicāhuiliā. Now, a drink?" As if they had never been enemies, all partied, kin united under one cause... except one.\n\nA rather rotund stallion having some food and talking to the chief of the Ixtapan. By his size and obnoxious smile, he fit perfectly the description of the Neighua closest to Daring Do. Caballeron approached with a practiced smile on his face, only for the stallion to walk away after some quick greetings.  "Maita is a very wise pony with a very kind heart, but he was close friends with Daring... I am sure you can be friends in the future, please do not resent him for this." Caballeron smiled "Of course, there was no offense taken at all... let us go? I heard there was an announcement to be made."\n\nAs the party continued and smiles were exchanged, the defining moment of the night was the ceremony to name Caballeron as Huey Tlatoani, ensuring he was not only president of Aztlan, but a leader to all Neighua... except Maita, who was wearing an aloof smile as all others laughed and partied. Caballeron wasn't one to give up; after all, what greater humiliation could there be for Daring Do than losing even her friends to him.

There is no one here—" As he spun around with his flashlight, it illuminated hundreds of bats perched around the ceiling, weapons in hand, their postures battle-ready.\n\nThe mere sight of this situation was enough to get his so-called escorts to run away screaming, a luxury he could not afford at his current position; not if he wanted the thestrals to ever stand down. "I see you have prepared a... welcome party. This is too much kindness." Caballeron smirked, inciting no reactions at all from his counterparts. "Tough crowd today, hahah..." He could feel sweat dripping down his face, hopefully they could not see it from up there. If small talk would not work, he'd need to think of something else—or so he wished, as his flashlight died and he heard the echoing sounds of dozens of wings starting to beat, closer, closer, closer—what else could he say?! This surely couldn't be the end of the run for him, after getting so far! He still hadn't beat Daring Do!\n\n"STOP!" The hooded guide shouted, lighting a torch from the wall "There's no point if he's dead! What are you all thinking?!" The figure got closer to Caballeron, their young face not one Caballeron recognized. "Caballeron came here to negotiate about our rights! We'd be no better than Celestia if we ignored his plight." With the torch illuminating his surroundings, no bats seemed to come closer. "I'm sorry for this and I'm sorry for not introducing myself sooner. My name is Light Narrative, writer for... It doesn't matter right now! What matters is what we can do for my people."\n\nA bit flustered, inexperienced... but this Light Narrative had a spark of potential. If Caballeron could help refine him, he'd surely prove a valuable tool for the future. He coughed, going back to his usual bravado. "I do not judge your misgivings about me. To you I am a representative of the Neighua, but my true hope is for Mareyans and the Coltecs to stand in this federation as equals... it is why I have come here today, face to face with you all."

The rest of the region is a bit less fascinating, dominated by jungles and only visited by settlers to establish logging camps and mines. As for the southeastern tips of Equus where the small town of Portland lies, they are nothing more than a hunting ground for dragons.\n\nSadly, the war has taken its toll on the Stableside region. Many industrialists have fled, often taking significant assets and expertise with them, despite Daring Do's reassurance. Some loyalists followed them when my forces neared the city. And war being war, the local infrastructure and many of the factories have been badly damaged. As for the vital railways, they have been sabotaged and bombed into oblivion.\n\nIt will take time and effort to restore it all to greatness but I'm nothing if not persistent."
jungle.30.a:0 "I, Doctor Cabelleron, promise it!"

jungle.31.t:0 "A Stable Economy"
jungle.31.d:0 "Should you travel to Stableside these days, you'd be hard-pressed to remember that it used to be a war-area not too long ago. Mines are churning out minerals. Oil is flowing. Trains are chugging along. And once again, ships full of goods are leaving and entering the port. The well-oiled machine of Stableside seems unstoppable in its march to prosperity.\n\nBy continuing to invest in Stableside and making permanent my subsidies and tax breaks to the industry, I can kickstart a true industrial boom in Aztlan, one that could make it a continental powerhouse. Sadly, my budget is limited and if we pursue this road, many of my project in Tenochtitlan and Baltimare will have to remain limited. Some even point out that by doing this, I am only resuming Equestria's imperialist projects, betraying the promises I made to the natives. But that just might be the cost of peak industrial performance."
jungle.31.a:0 "There is no alternative."

jungle.32.t:0 "Among The Ruins Of Old Aztlan"
jungle.32.d:0 "Ah, Tenochtitlan. Immortal city of my heart. City of lakes and canals. But also a city of ruins... Truth be told, the jungles of Aztlan don't have much to offer. Centuries of Equestrian imperialism let an entire civilization be lost to the vines. But some like myself can see through the thick canopy and I see a land of opportunities and of virgin beauty. Something can be done here. Should. Must!"
jungle.32.a:0 "I, Doctor Cabelleron, promise it!"

jungle.33.t:0 "The Sun Rises Over Tenochtitlan"
jungle.33.d:0 "The Aztlan Revival is costly and many in Stableside and Baltimare are criticizing me for it. I still need a lot of resources to fulfill my promises to the Neighua. If I attain my objectives, the heart of the country will truly beat healthily again. Of course, it will mean that our industrialization will be somewhat slowed down in an age where everything is accelerating at neck-breaking speed. But if I don't, can the Neighua really wait for another chance at carving their place in the modern world? It is tempting for me to say yes. But what would that make me but a sellout? A very rich sellout..."
jungle.33.a:0 "Let the world hear at last of the Neighua!"

jungle.34.t:0 "The Cursed City"
jungle.34.d:0 "Baltimare is the most populated city in our new Aztlan. It is by far one of the most modern of our cities, being a part of the larger Equestrian east-coast. It even played a major role in bringing about the Equestrian industrial revolution thanks to its coal mines and natural harbour.\n\nYet, despite its strategic location on the Eclipse Gulf and natural advantages, it was always less favored by industrials and investors than her sister cities such as Manehattan or Fillydelphia. Some cities would have answered with apathy but the Baltimareans stood proud. They unionized and made do with what little they had. And when the civil war torn Equestria apart, they fought a revolution. While we ended up on opposite sides, I respect them for it. And under my rule, Baltimare won't be forgotten anymore."
jungle.34.a:0 "I, Doctor Cabelleron, promise it!"

jungle.35.t:0 "To Break The Curse of Baltimare"
jungle.35.d:0 "After my initial investments and reforms in Baltimare, it is beyond amazing how far that city has gone. To think that it took so little to build so much makes you wonder how much Equestria didn't care about that city. Maybe the revolutionaries there had a point after all...\n\nNow with continued investment and focused industrial planning, we can transform Baltimare into a major industrial center by the next decade. However, it will take massive resources but there is no way we can hope to invest them here and still pursue my more ambitious plans elsewhere. It is not without risks either. By focusing so strongly on the Baltimare region, we remain economically dependent on the greater east-equestrian region for our economy. The state of affairs in Equus being what they are, such a dependence could very well put us in a rough spot should Equestria's troubles deepen. Worse, it would leave the tribal regions and the whole Southeast in a state of continued underdevelopment.\n\nMaybe I cannot afford to break the Baltimare curse in the end but can I afford not to?"
jungle.35.a:0 "Set aside no more!"

newjungle.1.t:0 "Class Enemies, Business Partners"
newjungle.1.d:0 "#TODO: Caballeron tells Golden Delicious he wants him as his "vice president", or rather Cihuacoatl since everything is Aztlan larp. Golden says he's going to keep fighting for worker rights, and that Caballeron should take the cities very seriously. Caballeron says he's happy to fight off the elites, it could be fun, but Golden has to be willing to work with the natives and thestrals to get there. Golden agrees."
newjungle.1.a:0 "I think we can make a great team."

newjungle.2.t:0 "Light in the Darkness"
newjungle.2.d:0 "#TODO: Light Narrative approaches Caballeron with an initiative to further integrate the thestrals. Caballeron approves it immediately, and Light is a little surprised. Caballeron then goes further: Light is clearly talented, popular, and competent. How would he like to be "vice president", or rather Cihuacoatl? Light is kind of flabbergasted at the idea of being leader, but nods."
newjungle.2.a:0 "You've got the spark!"

newjungle.3.t:0 "Old Faithful"
newjungle.3.d:0 "#TODO: Caballeron thinks about the many chiefs he's befriended, and comes to the conclusion that there's only one prominent one who still has severe reservations: Maita. So to mend wounds, he meets with him and proposes making Maita his Cihuacoatl. He clarifies this Federation will not have hereditary leadership so it's more like a "vice president". Maita thinks it over, and agrees to cooperation one condition--he leave Daring Do alone. With a sigh he agrees."
newjungle.3.a:0 "I was hoping you wouldn't ask for that..."

newjungle.4.t:0 "Waking from a Nightmare"
newjungle.4.d:0 "In a courtroom at Tenochtitlan stood Starry Night, his face a stoic mask as the judge read him his crimes.\n\n"- with your actions against the southeast during your paramilitary years, your vitriol-filled speeches against all creaturekind outside of Thestrals, and worst of all, the leaked plans for a Thestral-only state in the southeast by arranging camps for the Neighua and other peoples. You have committed inexcusable crimes against creaturekind; I hereby sentence you to death by firing squad. Please, take him away."\n\nThe bat stood, rage beginning to fill his eyes. "This cowardice was to be expected of a lesser people such as you, your so-called leader not even brave enough to face a chained bat, pathetic. HEED MY WORDS, WE THESTRALS WILL RISE AGAIN. BE IT IN A DECADE OR A THOUSAND YEARS, YOU WILL FACE OUR FURY." As he was dragged away to face his fate, none indulged his crazed ramblings; he would die with his ideas as irrelevant as they were in his lifetime.\n\n\nSomewhere else, deep in the jungles of Ayacachtli, a band of soldiers of all kinds stalked a Thestral warband, their leader keeping a close eye on them through his binoculars. They didn't come here to engage in battle, there was no need for that anymore. All they needed was one shot for this cauldron to disperse. After a few days of no opportunity, one finally presented itself as Caballeron noticed Stars Whirl preparing a scout party to leave the camp for the night.\n\nWith his soldiers ready, they kept a close eye as she stood tall among her most devout followers, surely some beautiful speech about dying for the nightmare and what not. "At my signal, fire at will." Tense moments passed as pony, griffon and changeling alike waited for a signal, Caballeron with one hoof up in the air as he watched her speech. Once Stars Whirl raised her hoof and her followers did the same, it was the perfect moment of weakness. "FIRE"\n\nDozens of shots rang out, many missing, three connecting: hind leg, stomach and neck. As she fell to the ground coughing up blood, Caballeron issued the final signal "TARGET DOWN, RETREAT!""
newjungle.4.a:0 "The people free to rest once more"

newjungle.5.t:0 "Purging PON-IES"
newjungle.5.d:0 "In a courtroom at Tenochtitlan stood Lavender Berry, watched by judging eyes on all sides, sweating profusely as the judge read his crimes.\n\n"- endangering the population, leading to the deaths of thousands during your purges and repressive measures as secret police chief and leader of IES during the times of the Baltimare Republic. You have committed inexcusable crimes against creaturekind; I hereby sentence you to death by firing squad. Please, take him away."\n\n"You... YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME. I'M INNOCENT, THESE ARE ALL LIES, I NEVER DID ANY OF THIS!" The stallion fell to the ground, tears and sweat streaming down his face. "G-GOLDEN IS THE REAL CRIMINAL, THEY ORDERED ME TO DO ALL OF IT, THIS IS ALL A MISTAKE, YOU'RE TAKING AN INNOCENT LIFE, I'M IN-" A hoof hit his face, his glasses falling to the ground as he tried to understand what just happened.\n\n"You killed my son! No one else did; it was you and your orders that did it!" An elderly mare stood in front of him, having left the jury; no guards moved to apprehend her, none daring to deny a mother's grief.  "He did nothing wrong and now he's dead because a sociopathic coward treated his life as just quota to meet" Tears streamed from her rage-filled eyes as others stood up, the whole room erupting with accounts of his crimes, many having lost loved ones during the purges.\n\nAs the gavel was hit to call for order and the guards dragged him away, broken families stood to see his last few scrambling moments, kicking and screaming for mercy that would never come.\n\nSomewhere else in a farm near Saltlickingham was a lone old creature. Swaying lazily as the chair went back and forth, gazing at the maize grew. He was saddened to give up his dreams of Stalliongrad being born in the southeast but glad to finally have some peace and quiet to tend to his farm once more, a letter standing by his table.\n\n"Enjoy your retirement and remember to live a quiet and peaceful life." Signed, Huey Tlatoani Caballeron."

newjungle.6.d:0 "#TODO: Caballeron meets with Daring Do smugly, having finally caugjt her. She defiantly says she's a freedom fighter, and his coy response is that he's BROUGHT freedom. His new Federation is a great place to live, and she has been sabotaging it. She asks what he's gonna do - kill her? He laughs and says of course not - she's getting a pardon, though that won't extend to any future crimes. Nothing will make him happier than knowing she has to live under his government and be a regular citizen, not a hero."

JUN_doctor_desc:0 "Born in Puerto Caballo, Caballeron has long been a student of archeology, fascinated by the cultures, languages and history of southeastern Equestria. To fund his studies, he sold artifacts he found, sometimes to rather questionable individuals. This proved to be worth it as he eventually graduated with a Doctor's degree, despite Daring Do, his arch-nemesis, often trying to intervene and rescue the relics before he could sell them.\n\nAfter the Equestrian Civil War began, Caballeron used the wealth he had acquired from the sale of artifacts to hire mercenaries and drove out the Lunarist forces from the region around Tenochtitlan. He claims to be defending the natives, though some doubt if his motives are truly honest."
JUN_nice_doctor_desc:0 "Born in Puerto Caballo, Caballeron has long been a student of archeology, fascinated by the cultures, languages and history of southeastern Equestria.

This proved to be worth it as he eventually graduated with a Doctor's degree, despite Daring Do, his arch-nemesis, often trying to intervene and rescue the relics before he could sell them.\n\nAfter he founded the Aztlan State in the southeast, Caballeron has worked hard to create a free federation where everybody's rights are guaranteed. Despite his background, he has proven himself as an honest leader who genuinely cares for the natives. Thus he earned the trust of Equestria, much to the dismay of Daring Do."
JUN_rat_horse_desc:0 "A filly full of adventure and exploration, Sweet Water grew up without much of any supervision, going about at her heart's content. Be it swamp, jungle, desert, no climate was out of her reach growing up and volunteering in any situation or company or explorer's guild to get down and dirty.\n\nAt the appropriate age, enlisting in the Lunar Guard auxiliary and serving a short term doing essentially, nothing of significance walking tiled floor and great halls, she quickly became bored and as soon as her enlistment was to expire, she rucked it South to continue her exploring. Getting approached one day, with the opportunity to be highly paid and lead ponies and militias through the jungles by the infamous Caballeron, she quickly accepted.\n\nThe little swamp fox, the jungle rat as it were, would train her ponies and take them through thick and dirty and make them a feared jungle fighting force. All the while, getting to get very dirty and muddy in the process."
JUN_merc_pone_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: December 22nd, 984, Tonaltzintli\n\n§YBiography§!: Born in the jungles away from the populated coastal cities of the South-East, Jungle Trek did not have the typical foalhood of an Equestrian. Far away from any schools or places of education, his father did his best to teach Jungle, and while he quickly learned basic subjects such as math, science and history, he was more interested in exploring the world and jungles around him. Seeing what more was out there was always one of his deepest desires, but so was there a deep appreciation for the untamed environment that surrounded him.\n\nOnce he reached adulthood, Jungle set off to find his own path in life, having a brief stint serving as a henchpony for Doctor Caballeron's schemes before finally settling in with a traveling mercenary band. Working for bits in Equestria and beyond, his charisma and his natural skill in combat earned him the admiration and respect of many of his peers, with one in-joke within the group being that he could have convinced Princess Celestia herself to marry him had he been given the chance. When the previous captain eventually died in battle, Jungle was agreed upon by the majority to become his successor, and their new leader.\n\nAfter becoming captain, Jungle did not have long before he was contacted by his former employer in his homeland, with an offer for employment in fighting for a newly declared Aztlan. He quickly accepted, not just for the money or out of loyalty for the Doctor, but also to return to the one place he always felt closest to. With a strong moral compass only occasionally blinded by bits and the loyalty of the ponies under him, Jungle Trek is ready to fight for a new flag, and perhaps a nation he can soon truly call home.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Rari"

 TRT_relocate_capital:0 "Relocate The Council"
 TRT_relocate_capital_desc:0 "Tambelon is not safe. Proceed with the relocation plan. The council must depart immediately to ensure its members do not get captured by the enemy. Once relocation is complete, commence execution of the original plan.\n"Live, so you may cleanse.""
 TRT_exterminate:0 "Reward The Troggles For Their Service"
 TRT_exterminate_desc:0 "The troggles have outlived their usefulness and their loyalty can never be guaranteed. They are hence reclassified into filth. Filth must be cleansed. Treat them like any other sub-goat race.\n"Do not cling on to useless things out of pure sentimentality. That is weakness.""
 TRT_mass_crystal_production:0 "Expand Crystal Production"
 TRT_mass_crystal_production_desc:0 "Crystal production has remained conservative due to reluctance to waste slaves. This is no longer of any concern. Scope of production must be greatly expanded to meet our needs. Conversion subjects can be told before procedure that this way they will cease to be useless.\n"Death is only the beginning.""
 TRT_begin_marching:0 "Begin The Death March"
 TRT_begin_marching_desc:0 "Our former master-race was purged long ago. Path of Now and Forever was flawed due to not applying this method to all other potential master-races. The grim task must now be fulfilled out of necessity. Use any means available to ensure no one survives.\n"Only a world with a single sapient race will know peace and freedom.""
 TRT_increased_fear:0 "Fear Of Extinction"
 TRT_increased_fear_desc:0 "Sapient creatures are naturally afraid of dying. Fear factor levels can be increased to levels never before reached. Power of goatkind will be unmatched.\n"Fear is the key, fear is what liberates us, fear is what keeps us free. They must always fear us.""
 TRT_recycling:0 "Develop Great Maws"
 TRT_recycling_desc:0 "A new kind of monster has been created: a large mouth with a digestive system attached to it. It will convert filth into pure, raw biomass. This will allow us to greatly accelerate biomass production.\n"Let no one call us wasteful!""
 TRT_new_economy:0 "A New Economic System"
 TRT_new_economy_desc:0 "Without slaves only goats remain to do all the required work. The age of decadence is over. Goats will no longer be free to do what they please. A third of their time must be spent fulfilling socio-economical obligations.\n"A single individual is nothing more than a single cell in a giant organism. Yet the organism cannot exist without cells.""
 TRT_goat_production:0 "Mobilize The Workgoats"
 TRT_goat_production_desc:0 "Slaves can no longer be used for production of crystal-infused armour for monsters. Goats must take over this responsibility as well. Both productivity and product quality are expected to increase, as slaves were prone to sabotage and inaction.\n"A single motivated and zealous goat can do as much work as a thousand slaves.""
 TRT_new_occupation_law:0 "Let Them Feed"
 TRT_new_occupation_law_desc:0 "Monsters had been trained to spare those creatures that accepted slavery. This is no longer an option. Monsters must be allowed to prey upon target populations freely. Any "resistance movements" will spend all their time fighting for survival.\n"Monsters have preyed upon sapient creatures since primordial times. Why should the future be any different?""
 TRT_recycling_2:0 "Put The Troggles To Good Use"
 TRT_recycling_2_desc:0 "Usable biomass should not be left to rot. The troggles may continue to serve goatkind in another more efficient form. Process them into raw biomass at once. Then distribute it to the biomancers.\n"They will continue to serve us after death.""
 TRT_goat_generals:0 "New Leaders For The Monstrous Army"
 TRT_goat_generals_desc:0 "Without troggles new military leadership is needed. Goats need to be promoted according to their talent and ability to learn. Heads of the council will become the highest-ranking army commanders.\n"Experience is the best teacher.""
 TRT_goatscription:0 "Introduce Goatscription"
 TRT_goatscription_desc:0 "Fighting can no longer be left to slave-soldiers or volunteers. It is the duty of goats to serve. More monster-handlers and biomancers are needed. Refusal to serve will be punished. Conscripts can be relieved once world purification is complete.\n"There is nothing more noble than sacrificing yourself for the greater good.""
 TRT_repopulation:0 "Repopulate The World"
 TRT_repopulation_desc:0 "Global goat population is currently estimated to be around 500 000. Restoring population to pre-banishment levels will take centuries at the current rate. Population growth needs to be accelerated by encouraging and supporting establishent and expansion of families.\n"A purified world is a garden full of fertile soil. All we must do is spread our seed, then we may grow and flourish.""
 TRT_superior_armor:0 "Enchanted Monster Armour"
 TRT_superior_armor_desc:0 "Enemies develop increasingly effective countermeasures. We must adapt or die. Increased magical power allows for superior enchantments. Combination with additional crystal lattices will result in superior armour. It will be almost inpenetrable.\n"Let them fight us with all the panoply of war. They can only prolong the inevitable.""
 TRT_goatvisors:0 "Meritocratic Goatocracy"
 TRT_goatvisors_desc:0 "Goats who exemplify military genius must be promoted into commanding positions. Promotion is to be based entirely on meritocratic standards. Good performance need to be rewarded. Yet loyalty to the cause must always be taken into account.\n"Survival of the fittest is a simple, universal biological principle. It cannot be avoided or subverted.""
 TRT_superior_magic:0 "Overpowered Magic"
 TRT_superior_magic_desc:0 "With sufficient levels of fear factor all goats will unlock their full potential. Godhood is within reach of all of us. Reality will bend to our will. Or it will break.\n"Now I am become Death, the shatterer of worlds.""
 TRT_leviathan:0 "Leviathans"
 TRT_leviathan_desc:0 "Sea serpent design is becoming increasingly obsolete. Proceed with developing an improved underwater monster design. It must be capable of facing the largest ships that sub-goat races are capable of making. Biomass cost is of no concern.\n"Behold, the hope of him is in vain; shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?""
 TRT_remake_titans:0 "Reverse-Engineer Titan Biology"
 TRT_remake_titans_desc:0 "Titans are primordial creatures with alien biology. The single specimen available can be deconstructed and thoroughly copied. Creation of artificial titans would provide us an upper hoof in the great battle against filth.\n"Will we next create false gods to rule over us? How proud we have become, and how blind.""
 
 TRT_relocate_capital_2:0 "A Safe Refuge"
 TRT_relocate_capital_2_desc:0 "It started without any warning. Some goats demanded others to convert to their "Eternal Doctrine" and kill all slaves on sight. Those who refused to obey were then violently attacked. This organized takeover attempt combined with the sudden disappearance of Grogar has led to the formation of a provisional council. However, Tambelon is no longer safe for it."
 TRT_save_troggles:0 "Save The Troggles"
 TRT_save_troggles_desc:0 "The troggles have served us faithfully so far. Yet they do not understand the context of this civil war, and many of them have remained loyal to the Eternal Doctrine, assuming themselves to be safe. They are very wrong. We must send goats to infiltrate our enemy and contact as many troggles as possible. Hopefully, they can be convinced to flee."
 TRT_reconsider_technology:0 "Reconsider Stance On Technology"
 TRT_reconsider_technology_desc:0 "Before, Grogar was strongly opposed to use of inventions made by the lesser races. However, would it not be ironic to use the technology of the subgoats against them? Besides, without the use of more advanced weapons, we might stand no chance against our enemies."
 TRT_more_slave_soldiers:0 "More Slave-Soldiers"
 TRT_more_slave_soldiers_desc:0 "Troggles have been used as slave-soldiers for a long time now, and have proven themselves to be loyal. Is there any reason to not use any other race as soldiers? There are warlike creatures on Zebrica who could be useful on the frontline. Why not throw them at our foes out of desperation, if nothing else?"
 TRT_reignite_forges:0 "Re-Ignite The Forges"
 TRT_reignite_forges_desc:0 "The vast industrial organizations of the subjugated nations have practically been disbanded and their extensive facilities have remained abandoned. This should change now. The slaves will be sent back to their factories and will be allowed to work for us with machines rather than just with their various appendages."
 TRT_slave_scientists:0 "Appropriate Science Of The Lesser Races"
 TRT_slave_scientists_desc:0 "Currently, almost all slaves conduct menial labour or chores for goatkind, even those who are very intelligent and could be useful to us in another way. Not only should we have dedicated slave-scientists, but we should translate the countless texts written by the subgoats and study them, so we may expand our knowledge of the world."
 TRT_new_occupation_law_2:0 "Diversify Slave Exploitation"
 TRT_new_occupation_law_2_desc:0 "Rather than letting monsters run rampant and enslaving those who want to be spared, we should utilize a more efficient occupation policy. Every able-bodied creature must be put to work, and the work they can do will depend on their personal abilities. This will guarantee more efficient usage of slaves."
 TRT_improve_living_conditions:0 "Improve Slave Living Conditions"
 TRT_improve_living_conditions_desc:0 "Slave mortality is high and their lives are full of misery and suffering. This makes a large scale slave revolt unavoidable. Their mistreatment must be reduced, as it didn't make them afraid of us anyways. Rather, it made them hate us. Giving them proper housing, food, healthcare and a modicum of free time should please most of them."
 TRT_soc_dev:0 "Embrace Modernity"
 TRT_soc_dev_desc:0 "If we want to fully utilize technology on a large scale, we need to adopt more advanced and complex societal organizations. Thankfully, some of the countries we conquered already utilized them, so we simply need to follow their example."
 TRT_read_nigga_read:0 "Ensure All Goats Can Read"
 TRT_read_nigga_read_desc:0 "Despite many goats being gifted in the arts of biomancy, there are even more who do not even have basic literacy. We should take steps to educate every goat and provide them with basic education, so all of them can unlock their fullest potential."
 TRT_civ_concerns:0 "Organize Civilian Economy"
 TRT_civ_concerns_desc:0 "The lesser races created various organizations to manage use of workers and ensure more efficient production. We should adopt their methods in the civilian sector to ensure the stable growth of our production capacity. Unfortunately, this means having to rely on advice and assistance from slaves, but this is only temporary."
 TRT_mil_concerns:0 "Organize Military Economy"
 TRT_mil_concerns_desc:0 "The lesser races created various organizations to manage use of workers and ensure more efficient production. We should adopt their methods in the military sector to ensure the stable growth of our production capacity. Unfortunately, this means having to rely on advice and assistance from slaves, but this is only temporary."
 TRT_aircraft:0 "Utilize Aerial Technology"
 TRT_aircraft_desc:0 "Flying monsters barely stand a chance against modern aircraft, made of metal and powered by combustion engines. We need to not only study designs used by the nations we have defeated, but also find former pilots among our teeming throngs of slaves and put them into service."
 TRT_ships:0 "Utilize Naval Technology"
 TRT_ships_desc:0 "In the time it takes for us to produce a single sea serpent, the lesser races can produce a dozen warships made of steel and armed with heavy cannons. It is time we enhance our naval forces with an actual navy, utilizing the dockyards of the conquered countries and staffed by slave-sailors."
 TRT_army_shit:0 "A Modern Army"
 TRT_army_shit_desc:0 "Alongside the monstrous army, we will now have a modern army, equipped with the latest technology developed by the lesser races, consisting entirely of slaves, volunteers and auxiliaries. Supported by the airforce and the navy, we can now bravely face those who oppose the rule of Grogar."
 TRT_accelerate:0 "Accelerated R&D"
 TRT_accelerate_desc:0 "It is not enough to simply copy the accomplishments of the lesser races. We must seek to innovate by ourselves. The intellect of goats is superior to all others, after all. In no time, we will eclipse every other race on the planet, and become the rightful masters of science."
 TRT_nukes:0 "Secrets Of Fission"
 TRT_nukes_desc:0 "While our spells are powerful, the lesser races have developed extremely powerful weapons of their own that rival our magic in their destructive ability. Why can we not use them too? Not only that, but the fuel for these weapons is also useful as a source of energy, which we sorely need."
 TRT_the_final_focus:0 "The End Of The Path"
 TRT_the_final_focus_desc:0 "The Path of Now and Forever has a clear and explicit reason to exist: it is a solution to a serious problem. But if this problem was solved permanently, then what need to follow the Path would there be?"

 eaw_decisions.1.t:0 "A New Base Of Operations"
 eaw_decisions.1.d_edge:0 "Oskar, Giles and Gore were seated around a table in silence. This room was in a house of some low-life filth that had been cleansed. Now, it would be their temporary headquarters. The move had been done out of necessity, to prevent quick defeat to those who refused to accept the light of the Eternal Doctrine, yet it still felt like they had been cast out from the paradise of Tambelon.\n\n"I am glad you accepted me as part of the council," Gore said, breaking the silence. "I know you were sceptical, but you told me the All-Father saw the wisdom of your doctrine. Therefore, I am obliged to follow it."\n"Yes, we're glad you did not betray us," Oskar grumbled. "Like all the other goat traitors."\n"Don't let anger overcome you," Giles said. "Once we inevitably prove the superiority of our pure doctrine, they will see the error of their ways and surrender. Then the Father will lead us again."\n"Yes! We must not waver! We must have faith in victory. When other goats see the light, see the darkness of their doomed path, they will welcome us as guides and teachers. Then, we shall execute the Doctrine and reach unto eternity."\nOskar smiled. "Thank you, my friends. I am sure that together we will triumph as before. Now, let us discuss our plans of action.""
 eaw_decisions.1.d_unedge:0 "Rachel, Randy and Abram were seated around a table in silence. They were inside a temporary tent that had been erected as their seat of government. Without Grogar, and with a cult running rampant, they had no option but to claim leadership over goats and flee to a secure location.\nRachel was the first one to break the silence. "So, um, am I the only one trying to process what just happened?"\nThe other two goats shook their heads. "We're back to being without our Father," Randy said. "And now we're stuck once again among this sub-goat filth! Everything was going so well, and now we've lost everything!"\n"Calm down," Abram said. "Maybe try munching on some paper. That helps me relax when I'm stressed."\n"We can't relax," Rachel said. "As part of the Faithful Six... erm, I guess it's the Faithful Three now, it is our duty to save goatkind and all of our slaves."\n"...Save our slaves?" Randy asked.\n"Well, yeah," Abram said, "those cultists said they should all be killed."\n"I... I was good friends with a sub-goat once," Randy admitted. "A minotaur. Sure, he was filth, but he doesn't deserve death. That's just cruel."\n"Exactly," Rachel confirmed. "They're taking things too far. Who knows, maybe they even imprisoned Grogar or did something worse to him. We have to stop them, and we can only do it by working together!""
 eaw_decisions.1.a:0 "United, we will win."
 eaw_decisions.2.t_edge:0 "It Never Ends"
 eaw_decisions.2.t_unedge:0 "A New Age"
 eaw_decisions.2.d_edge:0 "Grogar looked up at a great organic capillary tower that reached far above the clouds. Then he looked down at numerous gates of stone and crystal that were being constructed by goats. "Bray, I want a detailed repo-" Grogar said before realizing that Bray was dead. He snorted out of frustration, then headed down a set of stairs.\n\nEventually, he found the Faithful Three, Gore, Oskar and Giles. "There you are," he said. "I want a detailed report about our progress."\nThe three bowed to him. "Father," Oskar said, "The first experiments of space-born monsters has been a relative success. They survived for several hours before suffocating, and were able to reach great velocities. At this rate we will reach our goals within a decade."\n"Father," Gore said, "The dimensional portals are nearing completion. By studying portals constructed by ponies, we were able to create replicas that function for several minutes before collapsing. At this rate we will reach our goals within a decade."\n"All other worlds will be within our grasp," Giles concluded. "We just have to be patient."\nGrogar frowned. "I've been patient for millenia. A decade means nothing to me. But when we are ready, we will sail to a billion worlds. We will sail until every light has been extinguished. Only then can the multiverse be truly safe from mental enslavement.""
 eaw_decisions.2.d_unedge:0 "With the destruction of the last hostile military forces, the War to End All Wars had finally come to an end. It had always been Grogar's goal to restore goatocratic world rule, but now there was no purpose to it. The goats had found an alternative way to avoid repeating the past. So, why repeat it?\n\nThe Path of Now and Forever was abandoned, and slavery had been abolished. Some still resisted Tambelon's rule, but many creatures found their new lives to be rather comfortable, some even better than they had been before. The goats no longer ruled with an iron fist, but with a silk glove. Many soon realized something else, too: world peace had been achieved, and it was likely to last for a long time.\n\nWith the goats now treating other races with respect, cooperation and trade increased globally. Tambelon became a multiracial and multicultural hub, the capital of a peacefully united world. Meanwhile, in the outskirts of the most ancient city, Rachel stood and looked proudly at a space rocket, ready to launch.\n\nIt was the beginning of a new golden age on the planet. And soon, they would reach out into the stars."

 eaw_decisions.3.d:0 ""What do you mean all troggles have left and joined our enemy?!" Oskar demanded to know.\nThe fearful goat visibly shrank. "I... well, which part of it do you not understand?"\nGore tried to defuse the situation with a smile. "I think he does not understand why they did so."\n"Isn't it obvious?" Giles replied with a snort. "The goats who follow the Path of Now and Forever wanted to keep their precious slave-soldiers, so they sent agents to contact and rescue the troggles." He shrugged. "It doesn't change much. We will simply cleanse them later.""
 eaw_decisions.3.a:0 "So much for their loyalty..."
 eaw_decisions.4.t:0 "Technophobia"
 eaw_decisions.4.d:0 ""Call me a heretic if you want," Rachel told the assembled council, "but there are far worse heretics out there. Besides, nothing about the original Path of Now and Forever says anything about the use of advanced technology."\n"Unless it's related to mind control," Abram added. "I learned that from my time in the archives."\n"Yes, except that. But what other obstacles are there? Sure, the inventions were made by filth as we call them, but does that taint them? Can the idea not be detached from the creatures who made them?"\n"I've had my experience with technology, too," Randy said. "The devices lesser races have made can be very useful. Like the microphone I had to amplify my bleating."\n"Exactly!" Rachel replied. "Why would we deny useful tools for ourselves? We're just pointlessly crippling ourselves, which might end up dooming us. We need any advantage we can get against our foes, before it is too late!"\n\nThe councilgoats murmured. After a while, Abram spoke out: "We have decided to assign our most intelligent goats to study the machines of the subgoats. The Father might be displeased, but I think even He can be convinced that this is the right thing to do in times of crisis."\nRachel smiled."
 eaw_decisions.4.a:0 "How unorthodox."
 eaw_decisions.5.t:0 "A Shield For The Mind"
 eaw_decisions.5.d:0 ""Hayreka!" Rachel exclaimed as she burst into Abram's office, startling the goat.\n"Wha- Rachel, what was that?"\n"It's an interjection used originally by pegasi to celebrate a discovery or invention. But that's besides the point. Abram, my experiments have been a success!"\nAbram furrowed his brow in thought for a moment to recall what those experiments were, then widened his eyes in clarity. "Ah! You mean the anti-mind control magic shields?"\nRachel nodded frantically. "Yes, yes! The imprisoned user of mind control magic was completely unable to do anything to the test subjects in the effective range of the mind-shields. Do you know what this means!"\n"Um... well, I guess we can relax a bit."\n"Come on. With modern technology, we can mass produce these shields so every single goat has one. This means fear factor, slavery, world conquest, all those things are completely unnecessary!"\nAbram blinked. "Um. Bit late for that."\n"Nonsense. It's never too late. I came here to ask you to spread the word in the news! You're an editor, after all. When the word spreads, all goats will agree to abandon the Path, forever."\n"You remind me, it's time for my meal." Abram began to chew on a newspaper."

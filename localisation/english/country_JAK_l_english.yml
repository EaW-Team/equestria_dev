newjaks.1.t:0 "Dreams to be Buried In"
newjaks.1.d:0 "There was snow and dreams to be buried in, yaks' snow and dreams. Half-buried in a wrathful blizzard, Prince Bradford withstood the elements to commemorate yet another batch of soldiers having passed military training under conditions most other creatures in Equus would die from. Medals, horns, and hearty meals awaited them within the lonely yurt, but that would come after this tradition of blessing them in the freezing wind.\n\nTradition and dreams—Rutherford was doing his best to crush them all. Bradford didn't need to visit the other clan anymore to see the continuing degeneracy that festered there. The ponies offering free aid to an acquiescing yak, in the midst of an avalanche no less, was deplorable, a decision made so hastily. Short-term success, and for what? An endless stream of licking Celestia's horseshoes, abandoning the stalwart path of the yaks for serene submission.\n\nPonies wearing yak skins and fur. Disgust boiled within every inch of Bradford's being. Still, he did his best not to show it before these young recruits, many of whom had left Rutherford's realm for a society that millennia of bloodlines and lineages had always sworn by. The last thing they needed from Bradford was a smash of untimely anger, a sheer lack of discipline after gruelling months of nothing but."
newjaks.1.a:0 "Rutherford will have his rude awakening."

newjaks.2.t:0 "The Internal Empire"
newjaks.2.d:0 "A map hung before the assembly of jaks in the yurt where cloven hoof-shaped cakes had gotten stale over sweat-filled deliberation. Elegant ancient script adorned that map's labels and legend, with every town and clan given its own unique symbols and signs. The colours and the arrows, however, revealed how the Jakichikh's grim position: the east had shunned their fellow yaks and their whole identity; the centre, while it likely couldn't hold for Rutherford's sake, still must be fought for.\n\nOr so it seemed. It was a weak yak who couldn't strangle triumph from travesty. For those in the east, it would be nigh impossible for the Mangchijid to change their path—how could they when Prince Rutherford hailed from there? But how fast did he forget the Noyamanan who'd given him his beautiful alphabet (quickly abandoned for the simple Equestrian tongue) or dismiss the Kiyatukh—perhaps even the wayward Juyilkhai—who'd given him his pious history (quickly traded for a borrowed Ponish past)?\n\nOr what about the unsure centre? The Arusharii and the Süldintjid, though nominally under Rutherford's hoof, stood as proud warriors if maybe out of a fanatical fear of defeat: their loyalty would shift to a prince who empathised with their plight. Riper still were the clans who already felt betrayed: the Mankhutayid would be swept away by Rutherford's desire for rabid Harmonisation, and the Yurkid whose shreds of faith in the Mangchijids for protection against the griffons had now frayed. Only the Ghenikhan stood as the other clan to embrace the ponies, and even then, the elders among them would soon wise up to Equestria's dangers sooner than later.\n\nA good word here, an ultimatum there..."
newjaks.2.a:0 "...and Rutherford would awake to see the whole world Jaki."

newjaks.3.t:0 "Snowball"
newjaks.3.d:0 "Wherever the border between the two yak nations wasn't exactly vague, wherever allegedly impenetrable fences and barriers were put up to loudly declare, "This is yak territory, not not-yak territory," the yaks posted there could only stay and wait, remaining ever vigilant over a naked strip of snow.\n\n"It's time! What do fake yaks have?" one yak from the Jaki-Clan yelled from out of the wintry blue. "Nothing! All fake yaks want pony to step on yaks forever!"\n\n"Hey, yaks can hear sad yaks!" a shout carried from across the rift. "Prince see better way than just pure yak way!"\n\nA snowball would fly across the border. It fell pathetically into no-yak's-land. "Who is yak, yak that don't know own history?!"\n\n"Yak history is trap! Rutherford wants way out! Yak future is different than yak past!" Another snowball then flew back, dropping back into the ground.\n\n"Yak future? More like pretty pony princess future! Not yak future! Yak future will become pony future!"\n\nThe pelting of failed snowballs then persisted until officials on each side reined them in. Real fighting would come another day. Now, the watchtowers and the outposts couldn't dare move, and so couldn't their strangers on the other side of nothing but cold.\n\nAn errant snowball shot into the air, flamed into an explosion, then all headed for their guns."
newjaks.3.a:0 "These strangers, the ones that wear our wool and our faces..."

newjaks.4.t:0 "Heroes?"
newjaks.4.d:0 "At a carved statue of wood, radiating fine craftsyakship, Bradford lay. Candles and strange scents had lit his path here to a place of both remembrance and re-orientation, retracing the steps of that ancient yak deified here, his glory found not in being some timeless all-powerful spirit the shamans worshipped but in being... average. When the sea threatened to swallow his world whole, the nameless hero (of decent build and intelligence) applied himself against the elements and stood victorious, saving his village and all civilisation.\n\nAny yak could be him. Any yak like Bradford. Or his brother. They hadn't been scouts nor adventurers in their youth. Under these same skies, they played and danced, constructing a city's worth of snow buildings together only to smash them together. What a riot it all was...\n\nStill, that, too, must be shed. If even Rutherford faltered in the end, who couldn't? The temptation of family above all else, to listen to the ramblings of a blood-relation while putting in jeopardy all yakkind—\n\nIt all made him shake his head, huddling deeper into the shrine."
newjaks.4.a:0 "Gone from my life, gone from my excuses."

newjaks.5.t:0 "The Madmare of Khoriikhat"
newjaks.5.d:0 "The land of frost and forest of the north almost set out to prove its namesake every day by letting the snow fall and harsh winds carry it regularly, but to Star Mountain, it provided a comfortable buffer of noise that drowned everything out in it. But today was a rare occurrence where no snow fell, so every step crunched obnoxiously loudly in her ears.\n\nIt was hard to focus on what her friend, Blind Side, was saying as they strolled towards the communal bath house to warm up after a long day of training, because of how frustratingly loud the noise seemed. Then a careless yak standing outside a hut on the side of Star's path spat on the ground and muttered to herself, "Pony carry self like yak, but just pony walks." On any other day, this insult would've gone totally unnoticed, but in the silence of a snowless day, Star Mountain heard it loud and clear.\n\n"You wanna try that again?" Star halted, stomping her hoof into the ground for emphasis. "I don't think I heard you right."\n\n"Yak would be more than happy to," the challenger said, sauntering up to meet Star and leering down at her, which was more than enough for the pony who didn't hesitate to throw a punch under the yak's jaw, which sent them reeling and cast their helmet clean off their head and into the air.\n\nRecoiling for only a moment, Star's challenger brought their head down and rushed forward, hoping to score a direct hit and end the fight with a headbutt. A sense of fury rose from some untapped wellspring of wrath buried within her as she ducked down and caught the underside of the yak's neck with her whole body before proceeding to flip them on their back with a heavy, sickening crunch.\n\nStar Mountain saw red as she took off her sharp, horned helmet and nearly struck it clean through the yak's neck before the words of Blind Side stayed her hooves. "Stop Star! You can't accomplish anything from inside a jail cell! Let it go, you've proven your point!"\n\nShe was right, and Star knew it. She relished in the victory for a moment before taking her turn to spit on the yak and declaring to the crowd of onlookers now forming..."
newjaks.5.a:0 "I am as much of a yak as any of you!"

newjaks.6.t:0 "Level Ground"
newjaks.6.d:0 "Bradford sat upon the northern frontier, eyes and hide alight in the reflections of faint, far-off auroras. They danced, mystical wisps curving the night, echoes of whatever his ancestors were doing in the cosmos. Ancestors that often felt close yet distant at the same time, forever watching his steps with all of yak-kind at the brink of collapse.\n\n"Bradford."\n\nThat got him to yelp, to turn and see Kerr tinted in the shifting colours of the sacred lights. "Why Kerr yak here?" Bradford asked as if commanding an answer out of the intruder. "Does yak not know boundaries of spirit time?"\n\n"Bradford asked for help, so yak come at most serious time to show true seriousness." Kerr sat down, inches within the prince's personal space. The beauty of the auroras, he ignored, preferring Bradford's concerned view. "Yaks think different on tradition, but different yaks have same tradition. Rutherford wrong, but Rutherford also strong, united. "We yaks not survive with Rutherford in charge. Under sky, faithful yaks stand on level ground."\n\nThat was when he took out a mallet all primitive yet bedecked in metal ornaments and spikes. It shone under the lights as it was laid on the ground, right before Bradford's hooves.\n\nSubmission, this was, for now."
newjaks.6.a:0 "You have personal yak hammer.""

newjaks.7.t:0 "An Opportunity"
newjaks.7.d:0 "REPORT ON THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN YAKYAKISTAN:\n\nIn spite of the many difficulties VOPS agents encounter while impersonating yaks, we have successfully embedded infiltrators across the country in intelligence gathering roles.\n\nReports from Yakistown are not encouraging. Prince Rutherford is developing a nearly unshakable devotion to Equestria, largely due to his relationship with the element bearer Pinkie Pie. The Jaki secession crisis has recently forced Rutherford to align himself with Yakyakistan's small but growing communist movement, which is firmly under Stalliongradian influence. Chances of pushing the central government towards a pro-Changeling stance are minimal.\n\nHowever, the situation in Saihan Tolgod presents many opportunities. Prince Bradford, Rutherford's estranged brother, is rallying the yak clans to fight against all foreign influence. Though the Jaki Clan forms the core of his movement, he is now gaining support across the country. His victory would destroy Equestrian influence in Yakyakistan and ensure its neutrality in any future conflict.\n\nEven more promising is the Yürkid Clan. At the behest of their leader, Kerr, they have now joined forces with the Jaki. Our agents describe Kerr as a fanatical expansionist, but his goals are not entirely incompatible with our own. Having convinced Bradford that we can be trusted, he is now reported to be seeking Changeling military support for their cause.\n\nField agents advise strongly considering this request."
newjaks.7.a:0 "Another Equestrian pawn shall fall."
newjaks.7.b:0 "The yaks aren't worth the effort."

newjaks.8.t:0 "Changeling Advisors Arrive"
newjaks.8.d:0 "Prince Bradford shivered slightly as the Queen's Guard officer approached. With his chitin and the dark uniform he contrasted harshly against the snowy ground. Kerr, standing beside the Prince, was smiling ear to ear.\n\n"Yaks grateful for changeling help," Prince Bradford said shakily, "But Jaki-Clan and allies want to stop all foreign meddling, not just by ponies. Prince ask that changelings focus on war only."\n\n"Don't worry Your Majesty," the changeling replied in a raspy voice, "Our orders are to help train and equip your army, and we have ways of keeping our activities discreet."\n\n"Yes, very good!" Kerr interjected, "Bugs bring weapons, yes? Yak want to see new weapons!"\n\nAs Kerr and the officer walked away Bradford tried to reassure himself. With his brother getting aid from the ponies to the south he had no choice but to bring in the changelings. Surely they'd be willing to leave after he emerged victorious..."
newjaks.8.a:0 "Who says changelings can't be trusted?"

newjaks.9.t:0 "The Changelings Refuse"
newjaks.9.d:0 "After Kerr informed changeling agents that Prince Bradford wanted military aid the two yaks waited for a reply. Days went by, then weeks, then months. Eventually they realized the lack of a response meant the answer was "no."\n\n"Prince knew bugs cannot be trusted." Bradford said with a sneer, "Jaki and Yürkid clans must reclaim Yakyakistan alone!"\n\nWhen Kerr finally realized the changelings weren't coming he was furious. Only after thrashing and smashing for hours was he able to calm down. He thought the bugs were proud warriors, but they appeared to be just as cowardly as their pony enemies."
newjaks.9.a:0 "Bugs will get theirs eventually..."

newjaks.10.t:0 "Pony Special Help"
newjaks.10.d:0 "#TODO: Star Mountain's clique and followers disperse through the army, using their magical and winged talents to help the yaks as much as possible."
newjaks.10.a:0 "Teamwork lets SMASH better!"

newjaks.11.t:0 "Different Here"
newjaks.11.d:0 "Horror stories leapt from mouth to mouth; it'd been Dubni's turn to hear the terrors of Stalliongrad: Commissars sat around in lavish palaces to complain about theories and numbers, while outside in the deathly cold, millions had been reduced to hungry skin and bones. The hubris of a few imagining themselves as self-made gods and spirits, believing they could manage an entire world, convinced them to shoot every reasonable critic just to cement delusional creatures in the minds and hearts of the hopeless.\n\nBlood littered Stalliongrad's streets, a disease that had already infected the yaks to the east, yet the west lay leagues closer to those agitators. Their words, their ideas chipped away at the fabric of decency.\n\nLike today. Something about sharing, the right and the wrong kind of it. The village elder had knocked on his door, asked him several questions. Looked just as scared as he was. "What yak give today?" "Simple bread." "Why simple bread to this yak?" "Yak hungry." The sweat on Dubni's brow—his hide felt a dozen sweltering tons too thick. The communists has employed infected the definition of sharing for the sake of the poor and the downtrodden. Was he poor and downtrodden enough to count? A mental inventory: he wasn't that badly off; he could afford a foreign trinket or two. Disastrous... communist ponies stole poverty! Still, he must do something to take the pressure off. He dug into his memories of the past week or so, a stray detail...\n\n"Taksima yak, some yurts down, Dubni yak know. Found disaster, got injured. Yak angry at world, at 'system,' maybe.""
newjaks.11.a:0 "Yak give many thanks for talk," then the elder hobbled away like always."

newjaks.12.t:0 "Two Worlds"
newjaks.12.d:0 "From the mountains to the sea, from the core of Equus to the glaciers of the shore: this was the mandate for great khans, yet transcendence could be Kerr's. The ancient ones would be bewildered at his imaginings of conquest by cannons big and small, with an armed population of disgustingly high proportions—to sack a continent until it lay at his hooves.\n\nOthers, however, were poised to copy his dreams. How could Bradford be fearful of a fellow species and a nation masterminded by a kind of same-minded khan? A deal with the changelings would reap tangible benefits, including a camp of officers with ample access to an armoury of gloriously modern "boomsticks" one could carry or one could move around in tanks. They couldn't be wasted on Bradford's lack of ambition.\n\nEnough talk about Chrysalis being a role model for future conquering lured one such changeling sent just for the occasion. One generous dinner in Kerr's private yurt later—flooded with helpings of sour dried curds and fried bread—and anything and everything had been talked about to the smell of koumiss, of how Chrysalis had forged a brand-new society out of petty squabbling tribes (not unlike Bradford and his own attempt). Although she looked like a supersized cockroach smacked with black paint, she wasn't so scary. Actually, she'd been so amenable... "Bug country gained strength through adversary and discipline," Kerr said proud with a pump of the chest, already whipping out a medal. "Thanks to bugs' help, yaks grow big and strong and find new ways to navigate war. Do not tell Bradford; Kerr yak be there if Bradford yak find out. And... Lucinidea bug? Yes, Lucinidea bug must accept gracious thanks! Lucinidea become general!"\n\nShe did take the medal in her magic. A faint smile she sustained while the whole earth quaked under controlled smashes of joy."

newjaks.17.t:0 "As Written in a Million Skies"
newjaks.17.d:0 ""A new radio system for yak leader," said an aide to the prince, to which Bradford grunted as a formality. The hodgepodge of cables and metal boxes were a foreign oddity, but it'd been deemed useful to install at the insistence of several concerned yaks: "Army need faster way to talk. But here, prince yak use headphone to hear better." The pair of glorified ear mufflers had been stretched thin to fit Bradford's head, but put them on he did, just to hear the words from another yak dozens of miles away.\n\nScreeches took hold of him. He could only collapse from his chair, senseless as the fake radio set was taken away, replaced by maps and banners and honorary horns fit only for a khan. The premises had been stormed by a blizzard of armed yaks, bolstered even by the Yurkids from far up north, and now the prince's yurt was no longer his.\n\n"Bradford yak must stand down."\n\nKerr's words, all as he whipped out a megaphone, though several yaks were also planting microphones and speakers so his message could be heard for miles on end: "YAK NOT WASTE TIME SITTING ON BUTT! RUTHERFORD YAK INCOMPETENT, BUT BRADFORD YAK NOT KNOW REAL YAK WAYS! NEW WORLD STAGNANT, SIT AROUND WITH LUXURY LIKE ALICORN! NO SITTING DOWN! YAK STRENGTH IN VITALITY! YAK GREATEST INSTINCT AND ENERGY IS CONQUERING LIKE KHANS OF OLD!"\n\nThe ground had shaken and vibrated to the tune of a dozen things falling down; perhaps a few ears went deaf, and certainly his words echoed to the rest of his army standing guard over dead patrols.\n\nThe message was commemorated with a group smash destructive enough to tempt an avalanche."
newjaks.17.a:0 "The stones and mountain slopes speak, and they say his name."

newjaks.18.t:0 "It is Easy for a Yak to Conquer the World..."
newjaks.18.d:0 "At the heart of his own clan's ancestral lands, Kerr lay among his fellow Yürkids, showered with faint praise.\n\nArmies had danced with him, sang of his greatness hours ago on the way to the heart of the Jakichikh. Bradford's faithfulness to ancestry mattered not if they'd be dead in a few years by more ambitious foes who'd have swooped in with more of the continent than the khans could dream of.\n\nA cry from the Ubkhait had killed the momentum of their march, their armour as bulky as iron walls, dug into every curve of the mountain that could afford them cover. From the snow then rose a Khoriikhat yak, his ancestry clear from the accent: "Bradford yak knew others charge here. Yak say no more."\n\nHis spear stabbed the ground.\n\nSeconds of nothing, then shadows fell upon the slopes and the heights to jump, to quake the earth—"Stupid yak!" Kerr yelled in the midst of the tremor. "Yaks trap selves in avalanche!" All ways of escape closed, the four faithful Jaki clans descended: Ubkhait plates and positions deflected any push, Khoriikhat hooves and moves stole enemy blades from underneath their muzzles, Kahata'ut warriors directed the deluge of snow at their foes, and Jakichikh guns sealed their fate.\n\nNo audience with Bradford was negotiated. Only a piece of paper from the prince himself prepared Kerr's end: exile to the centre of the Yurkids, a fine city to make for a fancy prison.\n\nSo Kerr sat, free in his urban playground. The stipend to feed himself and pursue menial hobbies was generous, and praise did ring in his ears once in a while. But a step out of these walls spelled a bullet to the heart."
newjaks.18.a:0 "...but to step off and govern himself? That is the hardest task."

newjaks.19.t:0 "A Most Unexpected Event"
newjaks.19.d:0 "The commotion going on in the other room didn't bother Khan Kerr or the isolated Prince Bradford, yaks often got into very noisy fights over very trivial things, and besides, the Khan could always scold his soldiers after he'd made his point to the Prince. Kerr tapped his hoof against the dark table that separated him from his counterpart. "Prince will be provided for, but Prince must provide silence. Khan has no need for vocal enemy, and Khan have no problem making Prince sil—"\n\nThe tense conversation between the two was cut off as the door to the room was kicked clean off its hinges and the hulking pony that had helped to defeat Rutherford entered, and hastily fired at Kerr with a magical rifle. His body hit the ground unceremoniously, fur sizzling from the rounds and cloaking the room in a foul, pungent odor. "What is meaning of this!?" Prince Bradford stumbled backward into the wall, quickly realizing his back was against it.\n\n"The start of true glory for the Khanate." Star Mountain replied coarsely, her eyes sparkling with reverence for herself, "The great Ulysses has returned, and I have given him a new form! As we speak my troops are clearing the path for me to exercise that rule! I suggest that you use their absence here to make your escape into exile like your brother. For your own sake, of course."\n\nPrince Bradford looked on horrified at the smoke coming from Kerr and got the message loud and clear. Star turned and began marching out of the door with a wide grin on her face, "Farewell, Bradford," she called over her shoulder, the smile seeping into her tone, "I've got to join my soldiers and spread the good news that the Khan has fallen, and the Khatun has risen in his place! The best is yet to come!"\n\nFirst the war, then the coup, and now a counter-coup by the madmare Star Mountain herself. Hastily gathering what little things he could carry from his home, Prince Bradford lamented at what would become of his homeland, and if he'd see it collapse from afar."

newjaks.25.d:0 "11/1/996 — Dear diary, I won't forget the look on Papa's face when he stopped me, my brother Seva, and my sister Sveta while we were running through the manor playing tag. For the first time in my life, I saw fear in his eyes. Papa said that Celestia had abandoned Severyana and conceded to the revolutionaries, that we might be kicked out of our family home, and we'd have to say goodbye to the servants. I'm scared, diary, because Papa's scared. I don't want to go, but the reds just might force us out...\n\nIn the brief moments when the sun had begun to rise, but before it fully brought daylight, Star Mountain had some time to herself before she began her day. Since taking control of Yakyakistan, every moment was filled with decisions that had to be made and actions that must be taken, so that precious reprieve became all the more valuable. The old journal from her foalhood in Severyana felt heavy in her hooves as she flipped through the pages. That all too familiar feeling of fire and frenzy welling up within her chest and spreading to every part of her body as though all her nerves stood at attention.\n\n20/1/996 — Dear diary, the worst has come to pass. The servants stormed the manor, and dragged Mama and Papa outside before killing him in front of us. We gave them everything, and this is how they repaid us!? Then those damned reds made us pack our things and when Sveta protested, they... they shot her. Seva and I barely had time to get our belongings, something to remember Papa and Sveta by, before we were dragged to the train station and sent out to Yakyakistan. I don't know what's going to happen to us, diary, but I know that I have to be strong for Seva. He's all I have left.\n\nEvery bit of sadness welling up inside Star Mountain instantly evaporated into rage. Yak spiritualism actually had a term that described her feelings: a 'Hungry Ghost.' An all-consuming feeling that eclipsed all other emotions and replaced them with the most gnawing, burning hunger imaginable. For some it was addiction, others gluttony, for Star Mountain, it was vengeance.\n\n3/3/997 — Dear diary, after weeks of taking care of Seva after he fell ill after arriving here, he took his final breath this morning. His funeral is in a few days. I don't know what to do. I'm all alone.\n\nStalliongrad will pay for what they've done, and revenge will be exacted with the three oldest and strongest weapons of Severyana."

newjaks.26.t:0 "The Wheel Turns"
newjaks.26.d:0 "The smell of burning straw and wood, the melody of screams and bullets flying, and the sight of it all was as though Star Mountain had stepped out from her wildest dreams and dragged them into the real world before her. The Ghenikhan Clan has been a fifth column within Yakyakistan for decades, ever since their fetid overlord desecrated Severyana and gave the Ghenikhans the hope that they could repeat the destruction here. Now, however, the wheel of history moved forward and crushed the communists beneath its full weight.\n\nThere was no mistake about why Star Mountain, or her mass of cohorts, were here. The soldiers had fallen upon the Clan's lands with all the speed and destruction of a hundred thunderbolts, there was no way to see them coming and no defense could be scrambled. Massacre was too kind of a word to describe the events unfolding around her, as thousands died around her, taking their culture, their history, and most importantly the poison of socialism down with them into their graves. This was an extinction unfolding in real-time.\n\nThe only ones spared were the children of the Ghenikhan Clan, who instead were snatched up and taken prisoners of the new regime, to be placed in the care of other Clans throughout the country so as to wipe their culture from the record completely.\n\nAnd in the center of it all, dancing beneath the thousands of columns of smoke reaching up into the sky, each one their own monument to the fallen, there was Star Mountain dancing and laughing like a filly who just got their cutie mark. Most of her joy came from the nightmare around her, but the rest came from the realization that this was merely the first step on a long road to retribution. That searing wickedness in her was satisfied, but the vicious craving for more burned hotter in her chest. The lands around her would be cleansed in righteous fire, all scorching a path towards home."

newjaks.27.t:0 "All One Under the Stars"
newjaks.27.d:0 "There was a particular balcony just outside the throne room in Yakistown that overlooked most of the city on which Star Mountain insisted to speak directly to the people. However, unlike the decrees she, or her top officials, would give under sunlight, the Khatun had decided to give this particular edict under a blanket of stars.\n\nThe residents were ordered to shut off all lights, and factories had to halt production to ensure that no light interfered with the night sky, with the sole exception of two lights above the towering leader of the Khaganate as she stepped out before a cheering mass of yaks, ponies, and a sparse few griffons. All it took was a raise of the hoof and a wave of calm fell upon the crowd.\n\n"I often find myself thinking about destiny," Star Mountain began, her deep, coarse voice booming across the cold and silent city, "What else can explain the long road of hardship that has led me to command this nation, or the fact that I am Ulysses reincarnate. But then, this is only the view looking backward into the past, what I wish to speak about tonight concerns looking forward into the future, and it concerns all of you."\n\nThe vast audience said nothing, the only response came by way of a cold breeze rushing through the crowd as though the land itself wished to speak up, but Star Mountain provided it no such opportunity as she slammed a hoof into the concrete railing before her. "From the time of Ulysses to the present day, these lands have had a shared destiny with our neighbors, who once played a part within that fate before they were wretched from our control." The mare took off her horned helmet and looked up into the countless shimmering stars in the sky joined by the bright ribbons of incandescent northern lights, the crowd readily mirroring her action.\n\n"Every one of you, yak, pony, bear, penguin, and griffon alike is a child of the gods, given a bright, icy soul that was breathed into you by the great Aurora Borealis, and this is what unites all of us into the most glorious future that we will set about creating. Our brethren across the preposterous borders, and every resident in the nation now, will no longer be denied their destiny just as we will no longer deny ours! If you feel as I feel, then you will join me in sealing this fate with the stars and shout! Hurrah!""

newjaks.28.d:0 "The city of Yakistown looked a lot different than Baatar remembered, he'd only been a partisan resistance fighter for little over a year, and already so much had changed. New buildings sprouted from the ground like flowers in the first thaw, and yaks and ponies walked side by side seemingly with unending joy across their faces, every bit of it lending validity to the newspaper in his hooves.\n\n'General Amnesty offered to all partisans, report to your local police precinct for details!' Reading it from the harsh mountaintops he and his cohorts hid in to fight back, it seemed too good to be true, but then, so did everything around him. It looked as though the country was taking great strides into the future with every passing day, so maybe turning himself in would be like turning over a new leaf.\n\nBaatar looked up from the paper and held his head high as he moved towards the police building on the corner, swinging inside without the faintest hint of hesitation. The desk in the center of the room was staffed by a rather tired-looking white mare who nearly jumped out of her hide upon seeing a huge yak, with a twin pair of rifles on either side of him. "Oh! I'm sorry, miss, I'm here to turn myself in, I didn't mean to startle you." Bataar instantly unhooked the rifles from his sides one after the other before setting them down before the still apprehensive pony.\n\n"You know, I'll never get used to that." The mare nervously chuckled, parting the red hair from her eyes and sitting back down, gently waving her hoof in the air and calling over another officer, a rather short yak who was still much taller than the pony. "You said you were a partisan, which unit were you with?"\n\n"I was with the 14th Ghenikhan Marksyak Battalion, stationed just outside the ci—" Bataar was cut off harshly.\n\n"Ghenikhans?" The yak officer stepped forward, readying the lone rifle on his right side. "Are you a socialist?"\n\n"Yes, sir, but I want to leave it all behind and start fresh." Bataar couldn't hide the fear in his voice, but as he started for his next sentence, he was cut off by a bullet, then another."

newjaks.29.d:0 "It was like any other day of the week. Clock in, pour the powder into the artillery shells for five hours, break for lunch, only to come back and pour powder for the next five hours. There was a slight reprieve for Khulgana, though, today was the last day in the work week, which meant that the next two days were free from the monotony of the armaments factory and instead filled with the joy of spending the weekend with her three sons.\n\nThere was a festival scheduled for tomorrow, and she'd been saving for months in advance to make it a family trip to remember, the cost would be great, but the priceless smiles on their faces would make every bit of struggle worth it. Khulgana rubbed her eyes with her hooves as she got in line for the paymaster on her way out of the factory, standing as she had dozens of times in the dimly-lit concrete hallway when she heard a squeal of joy coming from the yak in front of her. "I no believe it! This for Saran yak!?" She bounced up and down, shaking the lightbulbs hanging from the ceiling and making the ground tremble.\n\n"Yes, that's right," The unicorn behind the thick pane of glass built into the side of the wall chirped back, "Now please, move along and let the nice yak behind you through."\n\nThe jubilant yak before her skipped on her merry way, and Khulgana readily took her place and tried to focus on the pony passing her a check rather than the swinging overhead light. Then she saw the number written on the check itself, more than double her usual take-home pay for a week's worth of work. "Oh, this check no for Khulgana. You make mistake."\n\n"No mistake, miss." The unicorn replied with a rehearsed sweetness, as though she'd had to say this a hundred times today. "The Khatun has seen it fit to increase the wages of every worker so that they may live a life befitting the Khaganate. Now please, move along and let the nice yak behind you through."\n\nIt took a second for it to click, and Khulgana reached for the check and held it as though it were made of glass. Every moment that passed, it became harder not to skip down the hall the same way her coworker had, but it was impossible not to let the tears roll down her face. She wouldn't have to skip meals so her sons could eat anymore, nor stress about deciding between paying the rent or electric bill, she could now live without worry. Turning to the paymaster one last time, Khulgana couldn't help but shout"

newjaks.30.d:0 "There had to be a link. Magnit Moonsong knew that a link must exist between the great stars in the sky, especially those closest to the moon which shone the brightest of them all, magical beasts that roamed the land, and the powerful crystals that came from deep within the earth. But to understand any of it, let alone cement any of the knowledge in scientific fact, he had to understand at least one of them, and with the ownership of several mines across the land, crystals were the obvious first step.\n\nNot that he expected the commoners under his command to understand a fraction of the secrets of the stars, but they didn't need to in order to assist in finding a connection. A team of a half dozen earth ponies and a single unicorn dragged a particularly clear chunk of crystal through the snow, its deep red structure glowing in all directions from the moonlight. "No, pull it a little more to the left, I want it perfectly aligned beneath the moon!" Moonsong spat, unable to contain his impatience. There were only so many precious minutes that this experiment could be performed, and he would not let them disappear like sand through an hourglass. They readily obeyed shifting the crystal to the side, "There! Right there that's perfect!"\n\nTaking a moment to make sure everything was in place, Magnit kept his eyes on the red glow, "Now you, unicorn, hit it with some of your magic."\n\n"With all due respect, sir, this particular kind of stone is incredibly dangerous, adding magic into the mix would make it more unstable—"\n\n"Trust that I know what I'm doing, ma'am. Or would you rather go back to the mines?"\n\nThe unicorn hesitated, casting an uncertain glance to her fellow ponies, looking almost apologetic for her next move. Her horn lit up, and a beam of pure magic shot out into the pulsating crystal, which started to grow brighter and hotter, enough to melt the snow it sat upon and boil it into steam within an instant. The ponies all started slowly backing away, but it was too late. The crystal exploded, sending a searing dome of energy out in all directions, and shards into a few of the peasants, whose wounds were seared from the heat. Three ponies were dead where they stood, and the rest were wounded, all except Magnis himself who only sighed, clasping his hooves together in prayer for the stars to accept the souls of the fallen peasants before taking out a notebook and calmly recording what had transpired, adding at the end."

newjaks.31.d:0 "A ruler can hardly reach their position of power alone, and further, they can hardly reach their highest point without someone by their side. But in Star Mountain's march to sate her eternal hunger for vengeance and fury, she hardly had the time to find someone who she could call her equal, let alone her love.\n\nToday was meant to change that, a great contest was being held in one of the larger city squares in Yakistown, and anyone who could be called anyone entered as soon as they could for her hoof in marriage. The day had started hopeful, with the certainty that by sunset, the Khatun would have met her muse, but so far, no one had even come close to clearing the high bar set for them.\n\nSome yaks displayed great feats of strength, seen only in some of the strongest bears of the Khaganate. Some griffons showed tremendous acts of courage and cunning through stunts and acrobatic performances. Even some exiles from Severyana themselves poured their hearts out to the Khatun, but their words fell on a hardened heart that wouldn't be softened. In the end, every single entry jumped their highest to at least hit the tops of their heads on the impossibly high bar, and few even saw it in their attempts to reach it.\n\nHundreds came and went from her gaze atop the high balcony, but none of them satisfied her. It was hard not to feel as far away from love as she was from any prospective partners, but then, this only made Star Mountain realize how this wasn't necessarily a bad thing. If no one could so much as stand in her shadow, then she must be a mare of singular peerlessness. This only lessened the sting of having to reject the last of the entrants, but it failed to fully remove it. Without a word, the Khatun left for her personal quarters alone, as she had so many other nights before."

The cold didn't bother Star Mountain, she was no stranger to the ice or the wind, but the sensation like her hooves were held down by lead was a wholly new one, growing stronger with every step towards her old family manor. Was it anxiety? Impossible, the Khatun feared nothing! Was it unworthiness? No one on the planet could be more worthy. Perhaps it was... Guilt.\n\nAs she looked out into the blanket of fresh, powdery snow across the spanning lawn, she replayed the memories of her brother and sister chasing her across the grass, or playing as knights with sticks in their mouths, or playing with the servants as they tended to the laundry. But just as soon as the vision came, it was gone, and only the eerie silence and emptiness remained.\n\nThe filth that had murdered Star's parents and her sister at least had the decency to bury them on the land as per his last will and testimony, and as Star Mountain made her way behind the mansion, trying not to make eye contact with the mausoleum to her childhood in a country which no longer existed. But as she drew nearer down the row of apple trees that stood on either side of a pathway to the graves, she felt her stomach drop.\n\nA whirlwind of sorrow and guilt and pain, building like a typhoon within her for years since leaving the home, fully brought itself to bear just inches from the graves. If only she were stronger, she could've done something to save her family. If only she were more careful, her brother didn't have to die. If only fate was a little more fair, it would've taken her instead.\n\nHer sobs began to fill the air, her large frame heaving with every gasping breath and trembling wail, none of which calmed the maelstrom raging within her. Step softly, a dream lies buried here. The words on her sister's grave snapped something within Star Mountain, the storm within her suddenly caught fire and eviscerated any semblance of sadness. Her lips pursed into a sour line, the task ahead of her coming perfectly into view. Fate wasn't fair, but she became the instrument of fate."

newjaks.36.d:0 "'I'm starting to understand why the peasants hate Mama and Papa. They refuse to share their love for us with those who work their land, and that couldn't be more clear than what happened last night. Mama was flogging a farmer for muttering 'Celestia would be ashamed' under his breath, and Papa threatened to shoot anyone who interfered, even the farmer's own daughter. She didn't even have her cutie mark yet! Who wouldn't hate living under the hoof of two tyrants like that? They only stopped after I begged them to, and the horror of it all was so great that the filly was stunned into silence.'\n\n'When the Revolution reaches Zvezdopadovo, my one hope is that Burushka and Seva aren't caught up in its flames. They don't deserve to suffer for the awful things Mom and Dad have done. Me, well, I can take it. I'm a grown mare, if the people of Zvezdopadovo decide to shoot me, it'll be no worse than having to live with the guilt of seeing the terror in that peasant filly's eyes.'\n\nImpossible. Star Mountain flipped the journal over just to confirm that it belonged to her sister Sveta, thinking it must've been misfiled, but there was no mistake. She stared out into the immense archival building, the rows of empty tables and towering ceilings that held nothing, and couldn't help but feel just as hollow. Her own flesh and blood... A sympathizer?\n\nNothing made sense anymore, the story Star Mountain had woven over the wounds of her heart began to unravel. What if she was wrong about Mama and Papa the same way she was wrong about Sveta? What if her family wasn't innocent? What if her entire crusade was based on lies?\n\nWhat if every drop of blood shed in their name was for nothing?\n\nThe unending fire in her subsided, and for perhaps the first time in her life, Star Mountain didn't feel any rage, any thirst for revenge, or ambition."

newjaks.37.d:0 ""No!" Star Mountain barked, the words flew from her mouth almost on instinct, her voice echoing across the vacant building. Her breaths came slow and labored as her mind desperately darted across the dim archival office, as though any of its desolate features or organized shelves could give her the answer she was after. The fire that had propelled the Khatun this far refused to go out without a fight and kickstarted the rage back to the forefront of her mind like a defibrillator. The hotter it burned, the clearer the conclusion became.\n\nSure, her parents flogged the serfs, but they never did so without a reason, and besides, a couple of lashings in exchange for housing and steady work seemed like a good trade anyway. Sure, her family may have earned a bit of animosity from the socialists, but the majority of it was entirely unjustified and fabricated. Sure, Sveta sympathized with the reds, but she was naive and misplaced her bountiful mercy. The journal had just proven the maliciousness of Stalliongrad, she gave them her sympathy, and they repaid her with a bullet.\n\nMore than that, Severyana gave those fetid peasants everything, and they repaid their homeland by taking up arms against it with an army built from lies! They've bitten the hoof that's fed them their whole lives, and then expect compassion? They slaughter the families of so many, and expect mercy? Where was the mercy for Sveta? For Mama and Papa? For Seva dying in his bed? No, they have not given any semblance of compassion, so they will not be spared the full wrath of the Khaganate.\n\nStar Mountain rose to her hooves with a wicked sneer stretched across her face. In one fluid motion, she closed the journal and tucked it into her coat before marching towards the twin glass front doors. She'd found the answer she'd been after within the inferno and the frenzy that had always been there. That was now in control. Its name was Star Mountain, the last of her line, the hungry ghost, and she will bring a sweeping wave of death upon the land and purge the blight of socialism from the land!"

newjaks.38.d:0 ""I can scarcely believe what I'm reading," Star Mountain set the report she'd just finished back into one of four tall piles sitting before her, a curious brew of amazement and sorrow in her voice. Within the headquarters of what used to be the Security Police in Stalliongrad was now a building between purposes, and today, that was sifting through every shred of evidence leveled against the secret police since the revolution. "This one here said that a group of SePo officers made the owners of a coal mine play catch with a live grenade, and then they simply shot the last one standing."\n\n"Yeah, I can hardly believe them either," Blind Side, one of Star Mountain's best friends, rolled her eyes, snatching up a page in the center of the long table she and a few other top advisors sat around, "I mean, some of these are just complete fabrications, there's no way they forced a peach plantation owner to play piano for thirty hours straight, only to shoot him when he stopped."\n\n"Well you best start believing them," Dasha Solepyeraya slammed her hoof into the table and commanded the attention of everyone in the chamber. The look in her eyes was somehow fiercer than ten hawks, but more distant than the horizon, "I saw SePo officers enable a group of serfs to steal a manor away from its owners and force them to work until they died from exhaustion."\n\nThe tension in the room was as heavy as it was preposterous. Blind Side didn't know whether to feel baffled or afraid, and casting a glance between Dasha and her friend the Khatun was like looking between a giant and a titan, both of whom were strangers. "My dear Dasha, there's no need for such hostility. Stalliongrad lay dead beneath our hooves, and the SePo that terrorized our great people are no longer free to act." Now the two were locked in each other's gaze, allowing Blind to rise from her seat and tuck it back in place. "Every atrocity will be paid back threefold, and this is the evidence we'll use to do it."\n\n"Say the word, Khatun, and I will make terror the order of the day!" It was almost frightening to everyone in attendance how a genuine smile could look so menacing, but Masha had mastered that unknown art."

Adrenaline shot through her veins and jolted her fully into the moment, her opponent, Torben of Clan Svartpels, didn't give her a moment to rest in their friendly sparring match and charged straight forward while reeling back to prepare the next blow.\n\nExpecting where it would land, Star Mountain waited for the immense bear to get close enough to where he couldn't correct his aim, and ducked beneath his paw and wrapped her hooves around it before using the punch's momentum to flip the beast onto his back. "Not bad, Khatun." Torben's low voice rumbled as he returned to his paws, lowering his head in an intense glare. "You're a living example of your race's highest strength."\n\n"I could say the same for you, Torben," Star growled back, adjusting her mouth from the damage it'd taken moments before, "I only wish the same could be said for griffons."\n\nTorben lunged forth, swiping a set of long claws at his sparring partner, who readily pulled her head back to dodge. "Just as you are approaching the limit of an equine's size and might, griffons accepted into our clan do the same. We call them owlbears."\n\n"The strong protect the weak, Torben." Star shifted her weight entirely to her front hooves and readied a deadly buck of her hooves back into the bear, only for him to jump out of the way, panting. "Then it follows that those of nobility in our society should be strong enough to protect those beneath them, who better to stand for Harmony than the best examples a race can provide?"\n\n"I couldn't have said it better myself." Torben reoriented his body and hauled back to throw another punch, with Star Mountain mirroring the movement. The two collided with a force strong enough to send a shockwave into the ground and kick up a plume of snow. The two stared intensely at one another, almost trying to bore a hole through the other with their stare before Star smiled and Torben broke out into laughter."

The judge was blurry from where Gold was sitting, but his voice was unmistakably coarse like gravel falling down the side of a quarry. "You cause so much pain, so much frustration, and yet when we finally pull you out, you're so small and weak that it's baffling you were ever capable of such agony."\n\nHe couldn't see it very well, but he swore the judge was posing for the cameras. Black Gold was one of the last in tens of thousands of sham trials that all ended with the same verdict. Most were old bureaucrats, some were old officers, and some, like Gold, were just vocal clerks. The stallion closed his one good eye and thought of home. That old musty apartment with creaky boards and a ceiling that leaked, and an upstairs neighbor that loved to stomp and snore. He hated the place when he was living there, but now he'd give anything to spend one more night there with his wife and two fillies. The last he knew, they had boarded a ship to Equestria, but if he knew the barbarians in charge, and the pain in his body reminded him that he did, they probably blew up the boat anyway.\n\n"It's truly a miscarriage of justice that the worst punishment I can pass down for your crimes is death," there was that damned judge again, "but for the crime of terrorism, treason, and conspiracy to overthrow the government, this court finds you guilty and orders you to be shot immediately."\n\nHe'd barely been in the courtroom long enough to let the soreness crying out from his wounds to fade into dull throbbing, but before he knew it, he was carted off out of the courtroom and put before a firing line of soldiers. None of them looked very old, which was just another tragedy added on top of the spectacle. After looking each of his executioners in the eye, he closed his for a final time and thought once more of creaking boards and leaking ceilings."

newjaks.41.d:0 "First came the broadcasts over the radio and the television that the Khaganate had decided the majority of the population was under the spell of a nefarious and invisible 10% who controlled the people in an equally undetectable way. For every act of open resistance, the Khatun declared over the radio with a voice like fire coming through the speakers, there were a hundred more that could not be seen, and therefore could not be punished.\n\nAlmost overnight, individuals ceased to be friends and began to be suspects, not out of any genuine mistrust, but out of fear that if they weren't openly hostile to those close to them, they might be suspected themselves of being within that slim ten percent. Neighbor against neighbor, coworker against coworker, and brother against brother, the reports began to flood the local garrisons, often full of complete fabrications or outright hyperbole.\n\nThen came the soldiers, thousands of them marching in lockstep before splitting off into their designated streets. The Khatun said that any town that failed to turn over ten percent of their population to rid the nation of the virus would be treated like 'a cancerous appendage to be severed to protect the vital organ of the state.' All at once, taking a page out of the Ghenikhan slaughter, officers dragged those in the reports, sometimes entire families from the same household, out of their homes and into the streets, kicking, and screaming. From there, they were force-marched out from their cities or towns to any given local body of water, which more often than not was frozen over, and forced to stand atop the ice. Without warning, an explosion from beneath the bruised and crying masses blew a hole in the ice and sent those who weren't killed by the blast tumbling into the freezing water below. Most drowned within minutes.\n\nSeveryana was in tears, a cruel surgery performed on it with little forewarning and no anesthetic that would leave a deep and terrible scar. Mothers were crying when their sons were pried from their arms, but it was ultimately for their own good. It's tragic to lose someone, and that wasn't lost on every soldier who carried out their orders, but it's even more tragic to let them enslave the people and undermine the nation. In time, everyone would come to thank the Khatun for doing what they were too weak to do."

The smaller mare was finding it harder to recognize what Severyana, or her best friend, was becoming, but days like this when they could speak frankly with one another did wonders. "After a while, they just become numbers on a page and not an actual death."\n\nIt was a perfectly cloudless day in the city of Princessyn, with a lovely backing track of bustling city dwellers and the odd songbird's call, and hearing those words coming from the Khatun nearly sent her tumbling off her back. "I'm... Actually delighted to hear you say that, Star!"

She wasn't familiar with such a fixture, but with every step closer, she began to see its material.\n\nThe bottom supporting layer of the pyramid were hundreds of the thick, haunting skulls of former socialist yaks, and moving up the chain were the skulls of ponies and griffons before the final layer of penguin remains. Some of them had holes between the eyes, while others had large chunks missing as though that part had been clubbed out, but all of them stared back into Blind Side with their empty, lifeless eye sockets. Every pair of dead eyes staring at her weighed her down as though she'd just picked up a mountain, and were she any weaker of a pony, she would've emptied the entire contents of her stomach on the sidewalk.\n\n"Oh, of course, I don't enjoy killing anyone, I wouldn't want to associate with someone who did!" The cheery voice of the Khatun only made the terror pounding in her friend's chest worse. "But like I was saying, I didn't want anyone to go numb to those numbers on the page, and by making monuments like this in every village in Severyana, no one could ever forget.

The only fragment of feeling left was hope that her third son who had been conscripted a year ago would return home.\n\nUntil then, her life was a grueling struggle of working twelve-hour shifts, sometimes for fourteen hours, six days a week, and returning home to barely any food and because of the gnawing, twisting pain of hunger in her stomach that never seemed to cease, barely any sleep either. She wondered rather morbidly as she rolled out of bed and into the kitchen, if she would die from being overworked or if her son would return home in a casket first and break her heart enough to join him.\n\nThe warm memory of the carnival Khulgana had taken them to felt more like a repeating curse in her mind that haunted her, and in this way, even her own memories weren't safe from the Khatun's sick, deranged actions. Before she earned more than enough money to support her family, but now, despite having no dependents and working more hours, she could barely afford oats or potatoes to eat. What little food she was able to buy had to be rationed, so as to be hungry all day rather than sated in the morning and starving at night.\n\nThe stress and fatigue were so great that days flowed into each other like water over eroding sand.

Suddenly, that door became a portal to an entirely foreign dimension with iron rules and dire consequences. Just yesterday, every teacher in the district was sat down in a neighboring town's gymnasium and given the news of a new education program Star Mountain had created.\n\nMathematics, sciences, history, the arts, and anything else in the curriculum was to be sharply cut down and replaced with a regiment of lessons on service, duty, and above all, loyalty to the state and the Khatun. Now Perfect Score's precious classroom, a sanctuary away from the insanity outside its walls, had mutated into a center for the brainwashing of the youth, and worse, she was the one forced to do it.\n\nShe rested her hoof gently against the brass knob of her homeroom, breathing in the last breath of free air and allowing her students to do the same, before pushing the door open. Perfect Score colourlessly set the new lesson plans on her front desk, which faced out toward the twenty other smaller ones, before turning around and erasing the week's unit on basic algebra. It pained the teacher to listen to the noise of her class quiet down, as though the last bits of liberty were draining from them like the last grains of sand in an hourglass.\n\n"Alright, students," Perfect Score began, hoping they couldn't hear the trembling in her saccharine voice as she steeled herself and spun to face the children, "I know many of you were just starting to understand basic equations, but our great Khatun has asked me to switch things up to more important matters."\n\nPicking up a piece of chalk with her magic, Perfect Score wrote the word, 'Discipline' across the wide whiteboard in big letters. "Dith-a-pline?" Melon Rind, one of her brighter and frailer students asked from the front row.\n\nPerfect Score nodded, imagining a rope slipping around her own neck if she botched any of these lessons, "That's right! Now, I need all of you to stand and line up against the wall, and we're going to race back into our seats as fast as we can until we can do it in no time!""

newjaks.45.d:0 "From the moment he woke up, everything seemed to get to Double Decker— the stiff bed, the fact that it was empty save for himself, the burning pit of hunger in his stomach as he lay motionless, anger boiling in him like a kettle on a stove. For a moment, he could pretend as though the country hadn't gone to complete madness, and that he'd waltz into the kitchen to cook himself a full meal and enjoy his only day off.\n\nThen Double Decker opened his eyes and the bare ceiling stared back at him. He shifted, trying to glean even an ounce of comfort and finding only a damp pool of sweat beneath him, only serving to enrage him further. Seeing that there was nothing to be gained from sleeping in, the short, silver stallion got up, scooped his wallet from the nightstand, and headed out, making sure to throw on a ratty coat as he did.\n\nThe city was beyond unrecognizable, as though the 'Khatun', or whatever that madmare called herself anymore, had personally warped every feature Stalliongrad had into a bizarre vision of itself. Except now, he couldn't even call the city by its actual name anymore! The street names were all different, every building was either renovated or defaced to remove all socialist imagery, and worst of all, it was a crime to slip up and refer to any of them by their old 'illegal' names.\n\nIt used to be bearable too, before his wife got conscripted as a garrison officer and shipped out halfway across the country to guard a prison. Rage, frustration, and despair grew every day since then, building pressure in the fragile bottle that was Double Decker's psyche. Everything came to a head when he passed a taller mare who happened to bump into him, sending a spiderweb of cracks across his mind, "Pardon me," the words hurled from his mouth like projectiles, "You wouldn't happen to know how to get to Marks Memorial Row, do you? I'm looking for the fish market."\n\nThe blonde mare before him looked equal parts stunned and frightened, frantically looking over either of her shoulders before spotting an officer on the corner behind the senile stallion, and motioning them over with their head. "You heard it here, folks! I'm a regular socialist here in Stalliongrad! I keep a secret stash of theory under my bed!" The bottle containing his fury had completely blown apart. "Right next to the portrait of Marks in high socks!""

newjaks.46.d:0 "Just under a hundred sets of eyes stared back at Star Mountain and her entourage of elite personal guards, each of their expressions balanced perfectly between patience and aggression. Most were polar bears, larger than average, but a few numbered among them were hulking griffons called Owlbears, but all of them were the motley army that had invaded the northernmost tundras of the Khaganate.\n\nOne among their ranks stood out, wearing a calculating expression on his sharp face, likely the leader. He approached without hesitation, the snow crunching beneath his paws, causing every soldier behind the Khatun to spring to life and draw their arms, which in turn caused every bear to lower their heads in preparation for combat. "Greetings, Star Mountain, I am called Bjornling." His voice was low and smooth, like oil pooling out from clear ice. His wide arms swung behind him as he spoke, gesturing to the mountain rising out from the otherwise flat tundra, or more specifically, the large wooden door embedded into its side. "I hope you can forgive my aggression, but I knew no better way to get a warrior's attention, such as yourself. Won't you come in for a feast?"\n\nStar Mountain tilted her head, clearly the suave ursine didn't think she was stupid enough to fall for a trap, and inversely, he must be smart enough not to set one for her. "For what purpose?" The towering mare's gravelly voice cut straight through Bjornling's vocal silk, "What's so important you have to drag me out here?"\n\n"The future!" A curious grin flashed across Bjornling's face, as though he were concealing as many feelings as he was displaying, "Give me a half hour, and I will give you the future of Harmony."\n\n"Oh yeah?" Star Mountain snorted, eyeing the ursine up and down with a smirk of her own, "I already know what lies ahead for Harmony and it's in the unshakeable U.P.A. But I'll tell you what, Bjornling, I like your attitude, and frankly, I get a good feeling from you. You have twenty minutes, and if I find that you've wasted my time or set a trap for me, you and yours are finished."\n\n"I wouldn't be so sure about the U.P.A." The crooked smile on Bjornling's face stretched further, all of his sharp and shiny teeth glistening in the frozen wastes. "But,""

newjaks.48.t:0 "Celestia Assents!"
newjaks.48.d:0 "It was almost too good to be true. Star Mountain hopped across the throne room like a filly on the last day of school, clutching an opened letter in her hooves. After all of the hard work to crush socialism in Yakyakistan, and to bring the torch of Harmony back to Severyana, Celestia has recognized the Khaganate's efforts and accepted our request to join the United Ponies Alliance!\n\nIt didn't even matter that the letter was signed as, 'Daybreaker', instead of Princess Celestia since that was probably just a nickname she used. In any case, the task we've been working towards has been accomplished, and in its place stands a newer and more important duty to uphold the light of Harmony from all those who seek to extinguish it! But perhaps equally as important, the news must be spread to every corner of the Khaganate so that all may celebrate the triumph of friendship! For despite every trial, every opponent, and every obstacle, it must never be forgotten that..."
newjaks.48.a:0 "Friendship always wins at the end of the day."

newjaks.49.t:0 "Celestia Refuses!"
newjaks.49.d:0 "It was impossible. The words Star Mountain read from a short, terse response from Equestria had to be conjured up from some dark part of her imagination, there was no way anything it said could be true. The flat refusal of the Khaganate's place in the U.P.A. planted a knife into the Khatun's heart, but every admonishment and condemnation of 'mass execution', 'terrorism', and 'bastardizing the benevolence of Harmony', among many others, sunk the blade deeper until her heart simply broke in two.\n\nA life's worth of service for Harmony and for the continent evaporated with a simple signed document from Princess Celestia. Star Mountain stood from her desk, shambled to her personal chambers, and collapsed into bed. About as soon as her head hit the pillow, tears started flowing for the first time since she'd arrived in Yakyakistan all those years ago as a filly, both of whom had nothing left anymore.\n\nA thought shot across her mind just before she fully gave herself over to misery: Star Mountain had never betrayed Harmony, not for an instant in her life, in fact, she'd only ever fought for it. But by allowing Caramel Marks to preach a gospel of poison, and envy, and death, Princess Celestia aided the socialists in their cause. More than this, she gave quiet approval to the socialists who stormed across Severyana slaughtering everyone who dared disagree with their tyranny! At every turn, Princess Celestia had aided communism at the expense of Harmony. Star Mountain wasn't a traitor, the Princess was.\n\nThe Khatun sprung from her bed and marched to the tall mirror standing at the foot of her bed and looked deep into the red, puffy eyes of a warrior. The task she'd been working towards with every breath, defending that radiant light of Harmony from all those who seek to extinguish it, never went away. Instead, the means by which to achieve it have changed.\n\nNow Harmony must be saved from the communist Princess Celestia!"

newjaks.50.t:0 "To Save an Idea"
newjaks.50.d:0 "A wave of steel and death swept across the Khaganate right to the edge of its border with Equestria, much like water meets shoreline at a beach. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers from every part of the nation marched in rehearsed lockstep towards their destination, some with fury in their hearts and others with prayers that they could make it home. Some were volunteers, most were conscripts.\n\nLeading them, calling a grim cadence of carnage and brutality, was none other than Star Mountain herself, who after marching with them from Princessyn uninterrupted, suddenly called for the army to halt. With another two sets of uniform stomps, silence reigned over the land of snow. The Khatun took several bounding steps away from her troops before turning to face them, tapping a small device mounted to her neck which, through a clever enchantment, amplified her voice to carry for nearly a mile in every direction.\n\n"Fall in!" Her voice sent a shockwave across the ground, kicking up snow all around her as though it trembled just from the sound, as every soldier fell into their position of an audience before the madmare. Star's eyes swept across the army just as a cold wind picked up and did the same, both inspecting their mettle. "From leading the warbands against the communist Prince Rutherford, to the campaigns in the east to reclaim our rightful territory from the griffons, to the liberation of Severyana itself, I have commanded this army for one purpose alone: The protection of Harmony!"\n\nWith every one of her words, an echo could be heard in the distance. Steam flowed off Star Mountain's colossal body, a testament to the wrath flowing through her veins as she spoke. "Today, I have gathered you all for a different purpose." She stomped, causing a mare in the front row of troops, nearly a quarter of the Khatun's size, to flinch. "Equestria as we know it has fallen. It is no longer the unbreakable bastion of Harmony. We are. Our mission, however, remains."\n\nThe wind picked up into a shrill howl, parting the mist billowing off of Star Mountain, "We are not merely marching to liberate a nation or its people, today, we will march to rescue the principle of Harmony itself, just as the Princesses would want!" The army exploded in a deafening battle cry, loud enough to silence the conscripts who meekly kept silent."

Star Mountain looked at herself clad in a violet dress whose fabric felt as though it were spun out of a dream, and her mane was done so immaculately that she couldn't have looked more beautiful if she tried. The long, bloody road had led her to the top of the world, Canterlot Castle, and now there was only one thing missing for her to look the part. If only Sveta and Seva could see her now.\n\nSitting on a red plush pillow on the balcony overlooking tens of thousands of anxious, murmuring spectators was a new royal gorget emblazoned with a simple butterfly. The unmistakable sigil of Harmony forged specifically for her reign. With one final look at the reflection, she steeled herself and walked out, feeling the weight of history with every step. Instantly, a wave of silence washed over the crowd as dozens of cameras and microphones spontaneously fixed on the Khatun.\n\nEvery town in the country looked at her, and it felt as though a thread suspended the entire nation, and Star Mountain was about to grab it and hoist it to its highest point. "My subjects, I do not wish to waste my time mincing words about the fall of Equestria, or the failure of the Princesses to protect it. As a result of their failure, the task of rescuing and upholding Harmony has fallen from the hooves of the eternal alicorns into mine."\n\nStar Mountain swung her gaze from the crowd to the cameras themselves and flashed a toothy grin as whispers grew amongst the people again, their voices sounding like the hissing of a viper pit, "But have no fear, subjects of the new Equestrian Khaganate, for Harmony has no better guardian than myself. As I am now, I lack the power of the Princesses to rule over such a vast realm, but…"\n\nWithout delay, the Khatun turned and plucked the gorget from its resting place and gently placed it around her neck. A storm of noise and anger surged from the thousands of spectators and hurled itself up at her, but Star Mountain only glared back, intent to meet their rage and break it against her own. "Through the power of Friendship and the mantle of Harmony which has been bestowed on me, I claim the righteous title of Princess of Equestria which will enable my reign!""

newjaks.52.t:0 "The True Crystal Princess"
newjaks.52.d:0 "Every step towards the two massive azure doors before the throne room echoed across the whole of the castle. The walls shimmered with gentle, cascading light, and the floors only matched their majesty, a beauty reflected by almost everything in Crystal City. It was as though Star Mountain was walking further into the aurora borealis itself as she stepped through the two crystalline doors and into the next highest point in her life.A gentle thud accompanied the Khatun as she marched across the red carpet that led to a lone violet seat, the Crystal Throne. Gathered around it were a few dozen journalists from across the country, and some from across the major cities of the Khaganate, joined on the other side of the carpet by the most loyal generals of the regime. The order of the day was owed to a chance find by a lowly clerk in the newly occupied Crystal Empire.\n\nBoth sides of the carpet began to chitter amongst themselves as Star Mountain passed them, and without much delay, squeezed herself into the throne designed for a much smaller mare than herself, causing silence to fall over the room. The Khatun slowly took off her helmet and placed it on her lap as she glanced between the reporters and her generals, frowning when she realized the clerk wasn't in attendance.\n\n"I've gathered you all here today because I have the most wonderful news!" She beamed with an uncharacteristically cheerful expression. "Yesterday, I received word that my ancestry traces all the way back to the time of Princess Amore herself in the ancient Crystal Empire. Do you know what this means?"\n\nNo one in the room knew how to handle the joy coming from the otherwise brutal, seemingly joyless mare, and chose to answer her with apprehensive stares. "It means!" She squealed, jumping up from her seat, "That I'm a legitimate ruler over the Crystal Empire! I'd even go so far as to claim the title of Princess of these most beautiful lands! Wouldn't you all agree?"\n\nAs though the small audience was waiting for their cue, the journalists stamped at the ground halfheartedly, while the generals cheered, drowning out any lack of enthusiasm. Regardless of what they actually felt, everyone knew better than to question the Khatun, besides, there was a good chance that her claims were valid."

newjaks.53.d:0 "Every part of Ocellus' body throbbed with a dull pain as she struggled to catch her breath, each pant sending out a puff of steam from her mouth. The mines of the far north were bitterly cold above ground, and somehow even more agonizing beneath it. If the soreness, the aching of her muscles, or the gnawing hunger in her stomach wasn't enough, the icy cold felt like a thousand needles piercing her carapace.\n\nThe blue-finned changeling's lip quivered, threatening to spill forth another round of sobs, but she was stronger now than she was a month ago when she'd been ripped from her college dorm room and stuffed down here. Instead, Ocellus thought of her dorm room, the treasured friends she left behind, the studies she'd never get to read again, and suddenly all of her pain was burnt up as fuel for her anger.\n\nEvery memory of laughter was another hard swing of the pickaxe that yielded a little more raw ore, and every interesting fact of history was a trip to the cart that hauled off her work. Ironically, Ocellus had been studying the history of her home country before she'd been forced to labor in the all-but-forgotten caste system. Chrysalis, in her nationalist fervor, had slain the Royal Males that used to run it in favor of a more efficient, meritocratic war machine. This was evidence enough for the madmare, Star Mountain, that Chrysalis was actually a communist, and her work must be swiftly undone.\n\nIt felt as though Ocellus were living through the nightmare of the past with every moment, and it was impossible to say anything against that, the barely-lit tunnels were stained with those dumb enough to make that mistake. The only protest the student had left was in the brief moments of respite and the memories that any regime couldn't touch. Some part of her held out hope, along with the hundreds of those struggling alongside her, that just as this old system ended long ago, and Chrysalis' reign was ended, that this too would pass.\n\nBut a louder part taunted Ocellus and told her that she would do nothing but break rocks until she died. None of them had anything left except their work..."

Rather than being offended, the massive, old buffalo couldn't help but laugh at his newfound companion. All around the two was nothing but lush grass with wildflowers peppered throughout the expanse, and just before the horizon sat a beautiful beach with shimmering water lit against the setting red sun.\n\n"I have seen much change throughout this land from when I was a calf, and if it weren't for strong creatures like you and me, communism would have taken over all of it." The Elder's voice was low, and his cadence was slow, as though every word were being pulled through a thick layer of syrup.\n\nStar Mountain nodded enthusiastically, still caught in a series of tiny sputtering coughs as she passed the pipe back to her friend, "I wish most of my citizens would see things the way you did, the way things actually are." Finally, the coughing ceased, and the large mare slipped her helmet off and held it in her lap. "If everyone loved their homeland as much as you and I do, communism would never have a chance."\n\nThe Elder stroked his hoof along the length of his beard, a gentle stream of smoke pouring forth from his nose, "Look around you, Princess Star Mountain, every bit of beauty you see here, every blade of grass and every grain of sand is appreciated. It's not seized by some false state to fund a doomed struggle against 'reaction', or whatever it is the reds prattle on about. I have you to thank for this."\n\nCrickets began to sing their song, accented by a sparse chorus of locusts hiding somewhere in the brush, and Star Mountain drank in the sight as though it were wine.

No doubt this would cause great unrest, and possibly even bloodshed, but we mustn't dismiss their envoy even despite that.\n\nAfter a long series of back-and-forths within our administration, the following conclusion has been reached."

Stood at the end of it all, across miles of radios, television sets, banners, and soldiers was Star Mountain herself, looking down at the spoils of all her efforts. She couldn't help but grin, which turned into a wicked sneer, which turned into a muted giggle the microphones, ears across the nation, barely picked up.\n\n"Equus, lend me your ear!" Her voice boomed across every speaker in Equus, and even more across the oceans in Griffonia and North Zebrica, "Today we all stand perched at the dawn of a new age for the continent, and as the sun rises tomorrow, we will all wake up in a new Khaganate, led by a new Empress."\n\nDiscontent was already the default state for any spectator, but her words had sparked a flame in them that began to heat up the more Star Mountain spoke. "You have not misheard me. Chrysalis is gone, Stalliongrad is vanquished, and the Princesses have proven their abandonment to Harmony and have run across the ocean to New Mareland." Hotter, approaching a boiling point. "In other words, my little ponies, the powers of socialism in all their wicked, infectious ways could not defeat me. No one could, and no one will. Starting tomorrow, the ports, the airplanes, and any other path some of you might think of using to escape will be cut off."\n\nThe populace all across the country, but especially in front of the Empress began to hiss and move like steam escaping from a kettle. They were about to explode. "For any of you who think that they will defy Harmony, you and your family will meet the same end that every other enemy to that most sacred ideal has. If you incur the Khaganate's wrath, then there will be nothing to save you from it."\n\nStar Mountain's words deflated as much as they incinerated, for every flash of anger within the hearts of millions, its heat evaporated their remaining wellsprings of hope they had. There was nowhere safe, there was nothing else, and no one was coming to save them. "However, I will save you all from yourselves. I will lift you up with true Harmony into the ones you were always meant to be, even if I have to force the better way upon you like a scolding mother. I am the Empress of all Equus, and you all are in my embrace.""

"But I couldn't have even avenged my family or homeland if it wasn't for you paving the way for me! You cleared that commie Rutherford off the throne just to set it up for me, how thoughtful!"\n\nHer eye twitched as she locked glances with the nearly broken remains of Golden Delicious or Queen Helvia's skulls, each possessing only one hollow socket to look back at their conqueror.

Even then, she wasn't too afraid as she passed by two elite yak guards and through the even larger stone doors which held Star Mountain.\n\nThere were two outcomes on Yakkenkova's mind as she marched towards the towering mare leering down at her: Either she would be praised, or she would be condemned. Neither of which she regretted. The room was bright with the afternoon sun, with the faint scents of the city below floating in through the window. Sunlight and aromas seemed to be the only thing adorning the room, aside from a few more guards, a throne, and the leader of the Khaganate herself, everything else was empty.\n\nIt made Star Mountain rising from her seat all the more foreboding, pressing down on Yakkenkova as though she had her own force of gravity. "Do you know why I called you here?" Her voice rumbled like gravel falling down a bottomless pit, her eyes intense, yet hiding their intentions.\n\nInstantly, Yakkenkova knelt before her, half from instinct and half from intimidation. "No, my Khatun."\n\n"Rise, and I shall tell you." As she picked her head up, she was stunned to see Star Mountain's beaming face, "I've heard of your exploits with the griffon settlers to the east, and I must say that your actions are illegal."

Since Yakyakistan, her life had been a slow and grinding climb upward, never once made to take a step back, but with every report of a supply caravan being ambushed, a night raid being conducted on an army base or city garrison, or bombing of rails or trade ships, she was forced to do so.\n\nThe Empress of all Equus hated the taste of defeat on her tongue, and hated that it only grew more bitter as the days went on. The east of Equestria was succumbing to that old hardline communist Masha Norushkina, the Heartlands were falling to Night Glider who rallied just about everyone into a united front against their Empress, and most absurdly, the storybook character Daring Do had joined forces with one of her own advisaries, Ahuizotl to wreak havoc in the southeast! Everywhere in the Khaganate she looked, Star Mountain either saw fire or the smouldering smoke of where a fire raged.\n\n"It's ok, it's all going to be taken care of..." Star Mountain reassured herself, pacing back and forth across her throne room in Canterlot, trying and failing to convince herself. "We just need to swing the army to one threat at a time and let each of the dominoes fall. The north hasn't fallen, so we can utilze it as a rallying—"\n\nThe towering twin doors on the other side of the chamber burst open, and a messenger ran in with a look of exhaustion and terror written on his face. He all but collapsed before Star Mountain as he bowed to her, lifting his head and panting desperately, "My Empress, I've received terrible news."\n\n"Another communist terrorist I presume? Where?" The Khatun braced herself for another blow.\n\n"Worse, Your Majesty," The messenger gulped, himself bracing for the reaction, "The Windigos have returned, and the entirety of Northern Equus is being ravaged by them. Entire cities have had no choice but to evacuate. The army has retreated as well."\n\nStar Mountain closed her eyes, as though the words themselves struck her, and dismissed the messenger.

The methods used in Severyana are likely not to be productive here, as changelings are naturally very skilled partisans. Moreover, communism has not yet fully sunk its vile tendrils into Changeling culture. Therefore, rather than decimation, we will show mercy.

JAK_sm_advisor_1_desc:0 "Dasha Solepyeraya is a name that evokes terror and fury in Ravenskoye. Noted for her cruelty and harshness against her serfs forced to labor in the salt mines, and for her near-monopoly on salt production in Severyana, her large, ancient dynasty was nearly completely toppled in the Winter Revolution. Many of her relatives faced decades in prison, while others were shot for their exploitation of the poor. She and her husband tried to fly to Trottingham, but her husband was shot down and drowned in the Celestial Sea. She only barely escaped.\n\nNow, she has joined Star Mountain's rightful crusade against the communists. She has a special hatred for pegasi who can fly better than she can, inflicting awful tortures upon them. She longs to return home to Ravenskoye to avenge her husband and retake her rightful holdings."
JAK_sm_advisor_2:0 "Magnit Moonsong"

His ancestors opened several profitable mines near the city and became boyars, until the Winter Revolution took everything from them. He has always been interested in magical beasts, and the influence of stars on them as well. He is determined to discover the truth behind these mysteries, no matter the cost. The stars are right to retake Severyana, and punish the ungrateful communists who have ruined his research and mines!"

There can be no negotiation with the communist scum. The time has come to retake Severyana, and pay back the upstart serfs--with interest."

They often contain ideas that go against the yak Way of Life, and as such censorship is required. A strange creature offered to help Jaki-Clan with their task of cleaning up texts from abroad: Abram the goat. He offered to simply eat all paper which contained offensive or misguided text. The yaks, lacking the technology of paper shredders, happily accepted Abram's offer. It is a symbiotic relationship: Abram gets to eat all the paper he wants, while the Jaki-Clan gets to control what its subjects read. Noyak knows how a goat even got into Yakyakistan, but Abram is seen as a trustworthy honorary yak, so his backstory does not matter."

JAK_GARRIN_DESC:0 "Garrin, the fiery leader of the Ubkhait clan army is quite different than her clan's cold tradition. She is easily angered and never forgets a slight--perhaps the reason she led her clan to the Jakichikh an old grudge with Rutherford. It's rumored that this grudge dates back to Rutherford spurning her affection, but she refuses to discuss such matters. Still, she is very experienced at holding the line, and the Shield of the East will not be broken easily."

A long-time rival of his brother, Prince Rutherford of Yakyakistan, Bradford simply wishes for his Yaks to be left alone. Unfortunately for Bradford, with tensions rising with the Changelings to the West, the griffons to the East, and Prince Rutherford practically breathing down its neck, the Jaki-Clan finds itself in a precarious position. Not to mention his fears of being undermined by his own so-called allies...\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
POLITICS_STAR_MOUNTAIN_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 31st of December, 979 in Zvezdopadovo.\n\n§YBiography§!: Star Mountain, born Burushka Zvezdopadovskaya, is a true anomaly in Yakyakistan. A Severyanian noble, her parents and older sister Sveta were lynched in the Winter Revolution, leaving only her and her beloved brother Seva alive. The two of them, then teenagers, had to beg on their knees to be spared, and even then they were ordered to leave forever, eventually winding up in eastern Yakyakistan. Disease struck Seva the next year, and the primitive yak medicine was unable to save him.\n\nWhen the Jakichikh seceded, Star Mountain sided with them, but not out of ideological reasons. She knows that harmony is necessary to keep different classes and races at peace, and that was sorely lacking in both Stalliongrad and Yakyakistan, but she knew her only shot at justice for her family was to bide her time. When Kerr overthrew Bradford, she took her chance. Now that all threats to her rule are out of the way, the new Khatun of Yakyakistan, reincarnation of the great founder Prince Ulysses, stands ready to bring her vision of harmony and order to all the countries of North Equus.

Only Star Mountain remains.\n\nI am the baton that hits the disharmonist, the gun that fires upon the insurrection, the axe that strikes down the communist, the inferno that burns out the changeling. I am the hungry ghost of Yakyakistan, the revenant that haunts the North, the shield against republicanism and the sword against revolution.\n\nI pledge my life and my honor to the Holy Severyanian cause, the extermination of the rebels wherever they may hide, for this night and all the nights to come.

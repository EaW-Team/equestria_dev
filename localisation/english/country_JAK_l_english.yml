### Events ###
newjaks.1.t:0 "Dreams to be Buried In"
newjaks.1.d:0 "There was snow and dreams to be buried in, yaks' snow and dreams. Half-buried in a wrathful blizzard, Prince Bradford withstood the elements to commemorate yet another batch of soldiers having passed military training under conditions most other creatures in Equus would die from. Medals, horns, and hearty meals awaited them within the lonely yurt, but that would come after this tradition of blessing them in the freezing wind.\n\nTradition and dreams—Rutherford was doing his best to crush them all. Bradford didn't need to visit the other clan anymore to see the continuing degeneracy that festered there. The ponies offering free aid to an acquiescing yak, in the midst of an avalanche no less, was deplorable, a decision made so hastily. Short-term success, and for what? An endless stream of licking Celestia's horseshoes, abandoning the stalwart path of the yaks for serene submission.\n\nPonies wearing yak skins and fur. Disgust boiled within every inch of Bradford's being. Still, he did his best not to show it before these young recruits, many of whom had left Rutherford's realm for a society that millennia of bloodlines and lineages had always sworn by. The last thing they needed from Bradford was a smash of untimely anger, a sheer lack of discipline after gruelling months of nothing but."
newjaks.1.a:0 "Rutherford will have his rude awakening."

newjaks.2.t:0 "The Build-Up"
newjaks.2.d:0 "To prevail in the conflict to come, we need to swiftly turn more clans to our side. We have already negotiated the secession of Yürkids, and there is potential for many other families to abandon the harmonist coalition. Of course, the weak-willed Mangchijids, once lucky enough to count Bradford among their sons, and the Ghenikhans, yaks fallen to the lies of Stalliongrad, will never give up their ruinous plans.\n\nThe level of loyalty for each coalition clan and the possible ways to decrease it, both direct and indirect, can be found in the list of available decisions. By bringing the standing of any given family with Rutherford to the lowest point, we will start a revolt timer - when it runs out, the disgruntled yaks will withdraw the corresponding banner armies and permanently join our side in the civil war. It should be noted that before it happens, harmonists will try to bring the loyalty back up and reconcile with our prospective allies, so several attempts might be required. Finally, we should remember the promises we make - when we win, every favor will be expected to be cashed in."
newjaks.2.a:0 "We shall be victorious!"

newjaks.3.t:0 "Snowball"
newjaks.3.d:0 "Wherever the border between the two yak nations wasn't exactly vague, wherever allegedly impenetrable fences and barriers were put up to loudly declare, "This is yak territory, not not-yak territory," the yaks posted there could only stay and wait, remaining ever vigilant over a naked strip of snow.\n\n"It's time! What do fake yaks have?" one yak from the Jaki-Clan yelled from out of the wintry blue. "Nothing! All fake yaks want pony to step on yaks forever!"\n\n"Hey, yaks can hear sad yaks!" a shout carried from across the rift. "Prince see better way than just pure yak way!"\n\nA snowball would fly across the border. It fell pathetically into no-yak's-land. "Who is yak, yak that don't know own history?!"\n\n"Yak history is trap! Rutherford wants way out! Yak future is different than yak past!" Another snowball then flew back, dropping back into the ground.\n\n"Yak future? More like pretty pony princess future! Not yak future! Yak future will become pony future!"\n\nThe pelting of failed snowballs then persisted until officials on each side reined them in. Real fighting would come another day. Now, the watchtowers and the outposts couldn't dare move, and so couldn't their strangers on the other side of nothing but cold.\n\nAn errant snowball shot into the air, flamed into an explosion, then all headed for their guns."
newjaks.3.a:0 "These strangers, the ones that wear our wool and our faces..."

newjaks.4.t:0 "Heroes?"
newjaks.4.d:0 "At a carved statue of wood, radiating fine craftsyakship, Bradford lay. Candles and strange scents had lit his path here to a place of both remembrance and re-orientation, retracing the steps of that ancient yak deified here, his glory found not in being some timeless all-powerful spirit the shamans worshipped but in being... average. When the sea threatened to swallow his world whole, the nameless hero (of decent build and intelligence) applied himself against the elements and stood victorious, saving his village and all civilisation.\n\nAny yak could be him. Any yak like Bradford. Or his brother. They hadn't been scouts nor adventurers in their youth. Under these same skies, they played and danced, constructing a city's worth of snow buildings together only to smash them together. What a riot it all was...\n\nStill, that, too, must be shed. If even Rutherford faltered in the end, who couldn't? The temptation of family above all else, to listen to the ramblings of a blood-relation while putting in jeopardy all yakkind—\n\nIt all made him shake his head, huddling deeper into the shrine."
newjaks.4.a:0 "Gone from my life, gone from my excuses."

newjaks.5.t:0 "The Madmare of Khoriikhat"
newjaks.5.d:0 "The land of frost and forest of the north almost set out to prove its namesake every day by letting the snow fall and harsh winds carry it regularly, but to Star Mountain, it provided a comfortable buffer of noise that drowned everything out in it. But today was a rare occurrence where no snow fell, so every step crunched obnoxiously loudly in her ears.\n\nIt was hard to focus on what her friend, Blind Side, was saying as they strolled towards the communal bath house to warm up after a long day of training, because of how frustratingly loud the noise seemed. Then a careless yak standing outside a hut on the side of Star's path spat on the ground and muttered to herself, "Pony carry self like yak, but just pony walks." On any other day, this insult would've gone totally unnoticed, but in the silence of a snowless day, Star Mountain heard it loud and clear.\n\n"You wanna try that again?" Star halted, stomping her hoof into the ground for emphasis. "I don't think I heard you right."\n\n"Yak would be more than happy to," the challenger said, sauntering up to meet Star and leering down at her, which was more than enough for the pony who didn't hesitate to throw a punch under the yak's jaw, which sent them reeling and cast their helmet clean off their head and into the air.\n\nRecoiling for only a moment, Star's challenger brought their head down and rushed forward, hoping to score a direct hit and end the fight with a headbutt. A sense of fury rose from some untapped wellspring of wrath buried within her as she ducked down and caught the underside of the yak's neck with her whole body before proceeding to flip them on their back with a heavy, sickening crunch.\n\nStar Mountain saw red as she took off her sharp, horned helmet and nearly struck it clean through the yak's neck before the words of Blind Side stayed her hooves. "Stop Star! You can't accomplish anything from inside a jail cell! Let it go, you've proven your point!"\n\nShe was right, and Star knew it. She relished in the victory for a moment before taking her turn to spit on the yak and declaring to the crowd of onlookers now forming..."
newjaks.5.a:0 "I am as much of a yak as any of you!"

newjaks.6.t:0 "Level Ground"
newjaks.6.d:0 "Bradford sat upon the northern frontier, eyes and hide alight in the reflections of faint, far-off auroras. They danced, mystical wisps curving the night, echoes of whatever his ancestors were doing in the cosmos. Ancestors that often felt close yet distant at the same time, forever watching his steps with all of yak-kind at the brink of collapse.\n\n"Bradford."\n\nThat got him to yelp, to turn and see Kerr tinted in the shifting colours of the sacred lights. "Why Kerr yak here?" Bradford asked as if commanding an answer out of the intruder. "Does yak not know boundaries of spirit time?"\n\n"Bradford asked for help, so yak come at most serious time to show true seriousness." Kerr sat down, inches within the prince's personal space. The beauty of the auroras, he ignored, preferring Bradford's concerned view. "Yaks think different on tradition, but different yaks have same tradition. Rutherford wrong, but Rutherford also strong, united. "We yaks not survive with Rutherford in charge. Under sky, faithful yaks stand on level ground."\n\nThat was when he took out a mallet all primitive yet bedecked in metal ornaments and spikes. It shone under the lights as it was laid on the ground, right before Bradford's hooves.\n\nSubmission, this was, for now."
newjaks.6.a:0 ""You have personal yak hammer.""

newjaks.7.t:0 "An Opportunity"
newjaks.7.d:0 "REPORT ON THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN YAKYAKISTAN:\n\nIn spite of the many difficulties VOPS agents encounter while impersonating yaks, we have successfully embedded infiltrators across the country in intelligence gathering roles.\n\nReports from Yakistown are not encouraging. Prince Rutherford is developing a nearly unshakable devotion to Equestria, largely due to his relationship with the element bearer Pinkie Pie. The Jaki secession crisis has recently forced Rutherford to align himself with Yakyakistan's small but growing communist movement, which is firmly under Stalliongradian influence. Chances of pushing the central government towards a pro-Changeling stance are minimal.\n\nHowever, the situation in Saihan Tolgod presents many opportunities. Prince Bradford, Rutherford's estranged brother, is rallying the yak clans to fight against all foreign influence. Though the Jaki Clan forms the core of his movement, he is now gaining support across the country. His victory would destroy Equestrian influence in Yakyakistan and ensure its neutrality in any future conflict.\n\nEven more promising is the Yürkid Clan. At the behest of their leader, Kerr, they have now joined forces with the Jaki. Our agents describe Kerr as a fanatical expansionist, but his goals are not entirely incompatible with our own. Having convinced Bradford that we can be trusted, he is now reported to be seeking Changeling military support for their cause.\n\nField agents advise strongly considering this request."
newjaks.7.a:0 "Another Equestrian pawn shall fall."
newjaks.7.b:0 "The yaks aren't worth the effort."

newjaks.8.t:0 "Changeling Advisors Arrive"
newjaks.8.d:0 "Prince Bradford shivered slightly as the Queen's Guard officer approached. With his chitin and the dark uniform he contrasted harshly against the snowy ground. Kerr, standing beside the Prince, was smiling ear to ear.\n\n"Yaks grateful for changeling help," Prince Bradford said shakily, "But Jaki-Clan and allies want to stop all foreign meddling, not just by ponies. Prince ask that changelings focus on war only."\n\n"Don't worry Your Majesty," the changeling replied in a raspy voice, "Our orders are to help train and equip your army, and we have ways of keeping our activities discreet."\n\n"Yes, very good!" Kerr interjected, "Bugs bring weapons, yes? Yak want to see new weapons!"\n\nAs Kerr and the officer walked away Bradford tried to reassure himself. With his brother getting aid from the ponies to the south he had no choice but to bring in the changelings. Surely they'd be willing to leave after he emerged victorious..."
newjaks.8.a:0 "Who says changelings can't be trusted?"

newjaks.9.t:0 "The Changelings Refuse"
newjaks.9.d:0 "After Kerr informed changeling agents that Prince Bradford wanted military aid the two yaks waited for a reply. Days went by, then weeks, then months. Eventually they realized the lack of a response meant the answer was "no."\n\n"Prince knew bugs cannot be trusted." Bradford said with a sneer, "Jaki and Yürkid clans must reclaim Yakyakistan alone!"\n\nWhen Kerr finally realized the changelings weren't coming he was furious. Only after thrashing and smashing for hours was he able to calm down. He thought the bugs were proud warriors, but they appeared to be just as cowardly as their pony enemies."
newjaks.9.a:0 "Bugs will get theirs eventually..."

newjaks.10.t:0 "Pony Special Help"
newjaks.10.d:0 "It was not often Kerr of the Yürkids was truly pleased to read a military report, not dismissively satisfied, or outright annoyed, but almost gleeful. "So yak warriors say these ponies work well?"\n\nHis aide bowed respectfully. "Yes, elder. Auk-si-lia initiative met great success. Their magics are strange, but make good, quick shelter and cover, even from barren stone."\n\n"Yak don't forget wings." Closing his eyes for a second and letting his imagination run wild, Kerr smiled. "Squad of flying soldiers can control mountain pass against any enemy. Weep, Rutherford - death from above come!" He made a cutting hoof gesture, keeping a wide grin on. "Banner-captains will deploy more companies. This is order!""
newjaks.10.a:0 "Their usefulness was quite undeniable."

newjaks.11.t:0 "Different Here"
newjaks.11.d:0 "Horror stories leapt from mouth to mouth; it'd been Dubni's turn to hear the terrors of Stalliongrad: Commissars sat around in lavish palaces to complain about theories and numbers, while outside in the deathly cold, millions had been reduced to hungry skin and bones. The hubris of a few imagining themselves as self-made gods and spirits, believing they could manage an entire world, convinced them to shoot every reasonable critic just to cement delusional creatures in the minds and hearts of the hopeless.\n\nBlood littered Stalliongrad's streets, a disease that had already infected the yaks to the east, yet the west lay leagues closer to those agitators. Their words, their ideas chipped away at the fabric of decency.\n\nLike today. Something about sharing, the right and the wrong kind of it. The village elder had knocked on his door, asked him several questions. Looked just as scared as he was. "What yak give today?" "Simple bread." "Why simple bread to this yak?" "Yak hungry." The sweat on Dubni's brow—his hide felt a dozen sweltering tons too thick. The communists has employed infected the definition of sharing for the sake of the poor and the downtrodden. Was he poor and downtrodden enough to count? A mental inventory: he wasn't that badly off; he could afford a foreign trinket or two. Disastrous... communist ponies stole poverty! Still, he must do something to take the pressure off. He dug into his memories of the past week or so, a stray detail...\n\n"Taksima yak, some yurts down, Dubni yak know. Found disaster, got injured. Yak angry at world, at 'system,' maybe.""
newjaks.11.a:0 "Yak give many thanks for talk," then the elder hobbled away like always."

newjaks.12.t:0 "Two Worlds"
newjaks.12.d:0 "From the mountains to the sea, from the core of Equus to the glaciers of the shore: this was the mandate for great khans, yet transcendence could be Kerr's. The ancient ones would be bewildered at his imaginings of conquest by cannons big and small, with an armed population of disgustingly high proportions—to sack a continent until it lay at his hooves.\n\nOthers, however, were poised to copy his dreams. How could Bradford be fearful of a fellow species and a nation masterminded by a kind of same-minded khan? A deal with the changelings would reap tangible benefits, including a camp of officers with ample access to an armoury of gloriously modern "boomsticks" one could carry or one could move around in tanks. They couldn't be wasted on Bradford's lack of ambition.\n\nEnough talk about Chrysalis being a role model for future conquering lured one such changeling sent just for the occasion. One generous dinner in Kerr's private yurt later—flooded with helpings of sour dried curds and fried bread—and anything and everything had been talked about to the smell of koumiss, of how Chrysalis had forged a brand-new society out of petty squabbling tribes (not unlike Bradford and his own attempt). Although she looked like a supersized cockroach smacked with black paint, she wasn't so scary. Actually, she'd been so amenable... "Bug country gained strength through adversary and discipline," Kerr said proud with a pump of the chest, already whipping out a medal. "Thanks to bugs' help, yaks grow big and strong and find new ways to navigate war. Do not tell Bradford; Kerr yak be there if Bradford yak find out. And... Lucinidea bug? Yes, Lucinidea bug must accept gracious thanks! Lucinidea become general!"\n\nShe did take the medal in her magic. A faint smile she sustained while the whole earth quaked under controlled smashes of joy."
newjaks.12.a:0 "It hid the homesickness."

newjaks.13.t:0 "We Smashed Enemy"
newjaks.13.d:0 "When gun smoke clear, best yaks left standing! Of course, we best yaks - lucky enemies flee and weep, regretting their foolish courage, while snow take in spirits of their dead."
newjaks.13.a:0 "Victory ours!"

newjaks.14.t:0 "Enemy Smashed Us"
newjaks.14.d:0 "Fight on border turned sour and many good yaks lie dead. Still, one battle is no war, and we will learn lot from this defeat - but first we rest and bury fallen kin."
newjaks.14.a:0 "Next time we win!"

newjaks.15.t:0 "Smashing Stopped"
newjaks.15.d:0 "Many moons passed, many small fights done, but like calf with log too big, we only scratched bark, and enemies did not much more. Both sides retreat to forts, and mountains will fall silent."
newjaks.15.a:0 "No stupid tie again!"

newjaks.16.t:0 "Border Raid Inbound"
newjaks.16.d:0 "Scouts report another strike from east! No full invasion yet, just probing attack, but we need to stop Bradford yaks, show them our strength!"
newjaks.16.a:0 "Let them come, let us SMASH!"

newjaks.17.t:0 "As Written in a Million Skies"
newjaks.17.d:0 ""A new radio system for yak leader," said an aide to the prince, to which Bradford grunted as a formality. The hodgepodge of cables and metal boxes were a foreign oddity, but it'd been deemed useful to install at the insistence of several concerned yaks: "Army need faster way to talk. But here, prince yak use headphone to hear better." The pair of glorified ear mufflers had been stretched thin to fit Bradford's head, but put them on he did, just to hear the words from another yak dozens of miles away.\n\nScreeches took hold of him. He could only collapse from his chair, senseless as the fake radio set was taken away, replaced by maps and banners and honorary horns fit only for a khan. The premises had been stormed by a blizzard of armed yaks, bolstered even by the Yurkids from far up north, and now the prince's yurt was no longer his.\n\n"Bradford yak must stand down."\n\nKerr's words, all as he whipped out a megaphone, though several yaks were also planting microphones and speakers so his message could be heard for miles on end: "YAK NOT WASTE TIME SITTING ON BUTT! RUTHERFORD YAK INCOMPETENT, BUT BRADFORD YAK NOT KNOW REAL YAK WAYS! NEW WORLD STAGNANT, SIT AROUND WITH LUXURY LIKE ALICORN! NO SITTING DOWN! YAK STRENGTH IN VITALITY! YAK GREATEST INSTINCT AND ENERGY IS CONQUERING LIKE KHANS OF OLD!"\n\nThe ground had shaken and vibrated to the tune of a dozen things falling down; perhaps a few ears went deaf, and certainly his words echoed to the rest of his army standing guard over dead patrols.\n\nThe message was commemorated with a group smash destructive enough to tempt an avalanche."
newjaks.17.a:0 "The stones and mountain slopes speak, and they say his name."

newjaks.18.t:0 "It is Easy for a Yak to Conquer the World..."
newjaks.18.d:0 "At the heart of his own clan's ancestral lands, Kerr lay among his fellow Yürkids, showered with faint praise.\n\nArmies had danced with him, sang of his greatness hours ago on the way to the heart of the Jakichikh. Bradford's faithfulness to ancestry mattered not if they'd be dead in a few years by more ambitious foes who'd have swooped in with more of the continent than the khans could dream of.\n\nA cry from the Ubkhait had killed the momentum of their march, their armour as bulky as iron walls, dug into every curve of the mountain that could afford them cover. From the snow then rose a Khoriikhat yak, his ancestry clear from the accent: "Bradford yak knew others charge here. Yak say no more."\n\nHis spear stabbed the ground.\n\nSeconds of nothing, then shadows fell upon the slopes and the heights to jump, to quake the earth—"Stupid yak!" Kerr yelled in the midst of the tremor. "Yaks trap selves in avalanche!" All ways of escape closed, the four faithful Jaki clans descended: Ubkhait plates and positions deflected any push, Khoriikhat hooves and moves stole enemy blades from underneath their muzzles, Kahata'ut warriors directed the deluge of snow at their foes, and Jakichikh guns sealed their fate.\n\nNo audience with Bradford was negotiated. Only a piece of paper from the prince himself prepared Kerr's end: exile to the centre of the Yurkids, a fine city to make for a fancy prison.\n\nSo Kerr sat, free in his urban playground. The stipend to feed himself and pursue menial hobbies was generous, and praise did ring in his ears once in a while. But a step out of these walls spelled a bullet to the heart."
newjaks.18.a:0 "...but to step off and govern himself? That is the hardest task."

newjaks.19.t:0 "A Most Unexpected Event"
newjaks.19.d:0 "The commotion going on in the other room didn't bother Khan Kerr or the isolated Prince Bradford, yaks often got into very noisy fights over very trivial things, and besides, the Khan could always scold his soldiers after he'd made his point to the Prince. Kerr tapped his hoof against the dark table that separated him from his counterpart. "Prince will be provided for, but Prince must provide silence. Khan has no need for vocal enemy, and Khan have no problem making Prince sil—"\n\nThe tense conversation between the two was cut off as the door to the room was kicked clean off its hinges and the hulking pony that had helped to defeat Rutherford entered, and hastily fired at Kerr with a magical rifle. His body hit the ground unceremoniously, fur sizzling from the rounds and cloaking the room in a foul, pungent odor. "What is meaning of this!?" Prince Bradford stumbled backward into the wall, quickly realizing his back was against it.\n\n"The start of true glory for the Khanate." Star Mountain replied coarsely, her eyes sparkling with reverence for herself, "The great Ulysses has returned, and I have given him a new form! As we speak my troops are clearing the path for me to exercise that rule! I suggest that you use their absence here to make your escape into exile like your brother. For your own sake, of course."\n\nPrince Bradford looked on horrified at the smoke coming from Kerr and got the message loud and clear. Star turned and began marching out of the door with a wide grin on her face, "Farewell, Bradford," she called over her shoulder, the smile seeping into her tone, "I've got to join my soldiers and spread the good news that the Khan has fallen, and the Khatun has risen in his place! The best is yet to come!"\n\nFirst the war, then the coup, and now a counter-coup by the madmare Star Mountain herself. Hastily gathering what little things he could carry from his home, Prince Bradford lamented at what would become of his homeland, and if he'd see it collapse from afar."
newjaks.19.a:0 "Uhhhh..."

newjaks.20.t:0 "Iron Rage"
newjaks.20.d:0 "Over a ridge and into the clearing, Menggei—chief elder of the Mankhutayid—led Bradford to the source of the earthquake that's been tossing small avalanches into nearby yurts: proving grounds littered with metal mock-ups of machines and their attackers, spearyaks and archers throwing everything they had into the mindless things.\n\n"Yaks there are rabid," Bradford observed. "Yaks have passion, but maybe yaks not disciplined for job."\n\n"Rabid yaks still useful," Menggei replied. "If prince yak concerned about discipline, prince yak can tell rabid yaks about discipline, how discipline channel and focus rage in better ways."\n\nThe mayhem lasted for a few minutes, and so hooves and snow rested afterwards. Pulling hauls of junk and scrap to the side, they dove into the pile of their "kills", throwing away what was useless and keeping bits and parts in bags and sacks. "Yaks not as opposed to machines as prince yak thought," Bradford could only comment.\n\n"They hate not just machine, also what machine stand for. Nothing bad with yak gears and screws. Gears and screws must have yaks as master, not soulless machine." A guilty smile fell on his face. "Rabid yaks will be useful, elder yak swear. Send yaks to other side, yaks send Rutherford machines to death very well.""
newjaks.20.a:0 "They're smart enough to recycle, at least."

newjaks.21.t:0 "Technophagy"
newjaks.21.d:0 "Reports of lost souls led the platoon-turned-search-party to a mess of snow-laden hoofprints. Yaks from both sides had apparently fled at the sight of beasts, so Miakwar read. Nothing else lay cradled in the cold white: ammunition, weapons, vehicles, materiel, spears and shields—not even shreds of a torn uniform.\n\nThe Yakyakistan border had been breached. It yawned open, inviting them in too easily. "Something wrong. Enemy not just leave behind open space. Squads, go where—"\n\nScreams burned their ears; bodies sunk into the snow while new ones rose. Axes glittered in the light, tinted by rust and blood, and the ground rumbled and cracked with every stomp. A primal fear invaded Miakwar, yet the shapes that ambushed them turned familiar: fellow yaks, albeit draped in ancient armour and ageing blades. Upon their hooves broke every rifle and magazine, every wheel and engine, to the hypnotic beat of each and every smash.\n\nBattle howls flooded his senses until his gun, his uniform—anything made within the past century or so—was violently transformed into rubble, naked but for his fur.\n\nHe ran as far west as he could."
newjaks.21.a:0 "The Mankhutayid's logical conclusion."

newjaks.22.t:0 "The Elders' Roles"
newjaks.22.d:0 "Gathered at the entrance of [JAK.GetLeader]'s yurt was a herd of much older yaks, demanding that they fight alongside the next generation despite the wrinkles and such they'd accrued. Tales of past glory, they could regale: when they were young, they could've subjugated entire mountains with their might, and that surely, age hadn't slowed them down one bit. In one case, it was a surprise that one of them had managed to make it here at all despite being reliant on his local village for pies and noodles.\n\nNow, there's the valid concern that they wouldn't be worth much on the battlefield. Their time was gone, that much was clear, but they could contribute in, for example, assembling materiel and vehicles or patrolling quiet villages in locales far from real danger. However, there was not a shadow of a doubt that letting them in the army would greatly inspire the fresh faces of our troops, carrying centuries of experience so that, at least, the young ones wouldn't die to a brain-dead idea that could've been avoided."
newjaks.22.a:0 "You fight at the frontline too!"
newjaks.22.b:0 "We find better place for you to help."

newjaks.23.t:0 "A Letter from Rutherford"
newjaks.23.d:0 "To brother,\n\nRutherford see country with more yak than one brother, but Rutherford not like to see Bradford suffer with no purpose. Rutherford see Bradford face-to-face if Bradford bring crown back and take kindness again to yaks not believing same things as Bradford.\n\nIf Bradford yak say no, brother also say no.\n\nPrince Rutherford"
newjaks.23.a:0 "The paper bends then breaks against the weight of tears."

newjaks.24.t:0 "Dull the Firebrand"
newjaks.24.d:0 "It'd taken much guts for him to confront the feisty left-headed upstart. The little Kerr had heard of his views on more deserving creatures like the khan himself wasn't encouraging. It probably was madness to invite someone who'd be so dedicated to undermine him. Yet, under the shelter of a yurt and the promise of a good hot and steaming meal and terms to negotiate reforms, Yngvar came.\n\n"Kerr make offer," he said. "Yngvar can become officer, great name in military like before. Kerr knows two yaks here believe very different things, but Kerr and Yngvar share struggle."\n\n"Funny Kerr say both yak share struggle." A sneer and a verbal jab was all it could take for Yngvar to tear the semblance of peace down. "Kerr styles self as power-hungry leech. Workers, real makers of worthy things, must be valued."\n\nKerr hoped a hearty nod would disarm him. "Yak workers, Kerr can agree with. Yaks be given many things like privileges and duties. Even many rights. Yak do wrong in mistreating yak. Yngvar can trust Kerr to use power to enforce worker well-being."\n\n"Kerr should." While his voice remained fierce, the steel in his eyes softened. "Ought to know the consequences if Kerr does not.""

newjaks.25.t:0 "The Good Old Days"
newjaks.25.d:0 "11/1/996 — Dear diary, I won't forget the look on Papa's face when he stopped me, my brother Seva, and my sister Sveta while we were running through the manor playing tag. For the first time in my life, I saw fear in his eyes. Papa said that Celestia had abandoned Severyana and conceded to the revolutionaries, that we might be kicked out of our family home, and we'd have to say goodbye to the servants. I'm scared, diary, because Papa's scared. I don't want to go, but the reds just might force us out...\n\nIn the brief moments when the sun had begun to rise, but before it fully brought daylight, Star Mountain had some time to herself before she began her day. Since taking control of Yakyakistan, every moment was filled with decisions that had to be made and actions that must be taken, so that precious reprieve became all the more valuable. The old journal from her foalhood in Severyana felt heavy in her hooves as she flipped through the pages. That all too familiar feeling of fire and frenzy welling up within her chest and spreading to every part of her body as though all her nerves stood at attention.\n\n20/1/996 — Dear diary, the worst has come to pass. The servants stormed the manor, and dragged Mama and Papa outside before killing them in front of us. We gave them everything, and this is how they repaid us!? Then those damned reds made us pack our things and when Sveta protested, they... they shot her. Seva and I barely had time to get our belongings, something to remember Papa and Sveta by, before we were dragged to the train station and sent out to Yakyakistan. I don't know what's going to happen to us, diary, but I know that I have to be strong for Seva. He's all I have left.\n\nEvery bit of sadness welling up inside Star Mountain instantly evaporated into rage. Yak spiritualism actually had a term that described her feelings: a 'Hungry Ghost.' An all-consuming feeling that eclipsed all other emotions and replaced them with the most gnawing, burning hunger imaginable. For some it was addiction, others gluttony, for Star Mountain, it was vengeance.\n\n3/3/997 — Dear diary, after weeks of taking care of Seva after he fell ill after arriving here, he took his final breath this morning. His funeral is in a few days. I don't know what to do. I'm all alone.\n\nStalliongrad will pay for what they've done, and revenge will be exacted with the three oldest and strongest weapons of Severyana."

newjaks.26.d:0 "The smell of burning straw and wood, the melody of screams and bullets flying, and the sight of it all was as though Star Mountain had stepped out from her wildest dreams and dragged them into the real world before her. The Ghenikhan Clan has been a fifth column within Yakyakistan for decades, ever since their fetid overlord desecrated Severyana and gave the Ghenikhans the hope that they could repeat the destruction here. Now, however, the wheel of history moved forward and crushed the communists beneath its full weight.\n\nThere was no mistake about why Star Mountain, or her mass of cohorts, were here. The soldiers had fallen upon the Clan's lands with all the speed and destruction of a hundred thunderbolts, there was no way to see them coming and no defense could be scrambled. Massacre was too kind of a word to describe the events unfolding around her, as thousands died around her, taking their culture, their history, and most importantly the poison of socialism down with them into their graves. This was an extinction unfolding in real-time.\n\nThe only ones spared were the children of the Ghenikhan Clan, who instead were snatched up and taken prisoners of the new regime, to be placed in the care of other Clans throughout the country so as to wipe their culture from the record completely.\n\nAnd in the center of it all, dancing beneath the thousands of columns of smoke reaching up into the sky, each one their own monument to the fallen, there was Star Mountain dancing and laughing like a filly who just got their cutie mark. Most of her joy came from the nightmare around her, but the rest came from the realization that this was merely the first step on a long road to retribution. That searing wickedness in her was satisfied, but the vicious craving for more burned hotter in her chest. The lands around her would be cleansed in righteous fire, all scorching a path towards home."

newjaks.27.d:0 "There was a particular balcony just outside the throne room in Yakistown that overlooked most of the city on which Star Mountain insisted to speak directly to the people. However, unlike the decrees she, or her top officials, would give under sunlight, the Khatun had decided to give this particular edict under a blanket of stars.\n\nThe residents were ordered to shut off all lights, and factories had to halt production to ensure that no light interfered with the night sky, with the sole exception of two lights above the towering leader of the Khaganate as she stepped out before a cheering mass of yaks, ponies, and a sparse few griffons. All it took was a raise of the hoof and a wave of calm fell upon the crowd.\n\n"I often find myself thinking about destiny," Star Mountain began, her deep, coarse voice booming across the cold and silent city, "What else can explain the long road of hardship that has led me to command this nation, or the fact that I am Ulysses reincarnate. But then, this is only the view looking backward into the past, what I wish to speak about tonight concerns looking forward into the future, and it concerns all of you."\n\nThe vast audience said nothing, the only response came by way of a cold breeze rushing through the crowd as though the land itself wished to speak up, but Star Mountain provided it no such opportunity as she slammed a hoof into the concrete railing before her. "From the time of Ulysses to the present day, these lands have had a shared destiny with our neighbors, who once played a part within that fate before they were wretched from our control." The mare took off her horned helmet and looked up into the countless shimmering stars in the sky joined by the bright ribbons of incandescent northern lights, the crowd readily mirroring her action.\n\n"Every one of you, yak, pony, bear, penguin, and griffon alike is a child of the gods, given a bright, icy soul that was breathed into you by the great Aurora Borealis, and this is what unites all of us into the most glorious future that we will set about creating. Our brethren across the preposterous borders, and every resident in the nation now, will no longer be denied their destiny just as we will no longer deny ours! If you feel as I feel, then you will join me in sealing this fate with the stars and shout! Hurrah!""

newjaks.28.d:0 "The city of Yakistown looked a lot different than Baatar remembered, he'd only been a partisan resistance fighter for little over a year, and already so much had changed. New buildings sprouted from the ground like flowers in the first thaw, and yaks and ponies walked side by side seemingly with unending joy across their faces, every bit of it lending validity to the newspaper in his hooves.\n\n'General Amnesty offered to all partisans, report to your local police precinct for details!' Reading it from the harsh mountaintops he and his cohorts hid in to fight back, it seemed too good to be true, but then, so did everything around him. It looked as though the country was taking great strides into the future with every passing day, so maybe turning himself in would be like turning over a new leaf.\n\nBaatar looked up from the paper and held his head high as he moved towards the police building on the corner, swinging inside without the faintest hint of hesitation. The desk in the center of the room was staffed by a rather tired-looking white mare who nearly jumped out of her hide upon seeing a huge yak, with a twin pair of rifles on either side of him. "Oh! I'm sorry, miss, I'm here to turn myself in, I didn't mean to startle you." Bataar instantly unhooked the rifles from his sides one after the other before setting them down before the still apprehensive pony.\n\n"You know, I'll never get used to that." The mare nervously chuckled, parting the red hair from her eyes and sitting back down, gently waving her hoof in the air and calling over another officer, a rather short yak who was still much taller than the pony. "You said you were a partisan, which unit were you with?"\n\n"I was with the 14th Ghenikhan Marksyak Battalion, stationed just outside the ci—" Bataar was cut off harshly.\n\n"Ghenikhans?" The yak officer stepped forward, readying the lone rifle on his right side. "Are you a socialist?"\n\n"Yes, sir, but I want to leave it all behind and start fresh." Bataar couldn't hide the fear in his voice, but as he started for his next sentence, he was cut off by a bullet, then another."

newjaks.29.d:0 "It was like any other day of the week. Clock in, pour the powder into the artillery shells for five hours, break for lunch, only to come back and pour powder for the next five hours. There was a slight reprieve for Khulgana, though, today was the last day in the work week, which meant that the next two days were free from the monotony of the armaments factory and instead filled with the joy of spending the weekend with her three sons.\n\nThere was a festival scheduled for tomorrow, and she'd been saving for months in advance to make it a family trip to remember, the cost would be great, but the priceless smiles on their faces would make every bit of struggle worth it. Khulgana rubbed her eyes with her hooves as she got in line for the paymaster on her way out of the factory, standing as she had dozens of times in the dimly-lit concrete hallway when she heard a squeal of joy coming from the yak in front of her. "I no believe it! This for Saran yak!?" She bounced up and down, shaking the lightbulbs hanging from the ceiling and making the ground tremble.\n\n"Yes, that's right," The unicorn behind the thick pane of glass built into the side of the wall chirped back, "Now please, move along and let the nice yak behind you through."\n\nThe jubilant yak before her skipped on her merry way, and Khulgana readily took her place and tried to focus on the pony passing her a check rather than the swinging overhead light. Then she saw the number written on the check itself, more than double her usual take-home pay for a week's worth of work. "Oh, this check no for Khulgana. You make mistake."\n\n"No mistake, miss." The unicorn replied with a rehearsed sweetness, as though she'd had to say this a hundred times today. "The Khatun has seen it fit to increase the wages of every worker so that they may live a life befitting the Khaganate. Now please, move along and let the nice yak behind you through."\n\nIt took a second for it to click, and Khulgana reached for the check and held it as though it were made of glass. Every moment that passed, it became harder not to skip down the hall the same way her coworker had, but it was impossible not to let the tears roll down her face. She wouldn't have to skip meals so her sons could eat anymore, nor stress about deciding between paying the rent or electric bill, she could now live without worry. Turning to the paymaster one last time, Khulgana couldn't help but shout"

newjaks.30.d:0 "There had to be a link. Magnit Moonsong knew that a link must exist between the great stars in the sky, especially those closest to the moon which shone the brightest of them all, magical beasts that roamed the land, and the powerful crystals that came from deep within the earth. But to understand any of it, let alone cement any of the knowledge in scientific fact, he had to understand at least one of them, and with the ownership of several mines across the land, crystals were the obvious first step.\n\nNot that he expected the commoners under his command to understand a fraction of the secrets of the stars, but they didn't need to in order to assist in finding a connection. A team of a half dozen earth ponies and a single unicorn dragged a particularly clear chunk of crystal through the snow, its deep red structure glowing in all directions from the moonlight. "No, pull it a little more to the left, I want it perfectly aligned beneath the moon!" Moonsong spat, unable to contain his impatience. There were only so many precious minutes that this experiment could be performed, and he would not let them disappear like sand through an hourglass. They readily obeyed, shifting the crystal to the side, "There! Right there that's perfect!"\n\nTaking a moment to make sure everything was in place, Magnit kept his eyes on the red glow, "Now you, unicorn, hit it with some of your magic."\n\n"With all due respect, sir, this particular kind of stone is incredibly dangerous, adding magic into the mix would make it more unstable—"\n\n"Trust that I know what I'm doing, ma'am. Or would you rather go back to the mines?"\n\nThe unicorn hesitated, casting an uncertain glance to her fellow ponies, looking almost apologetic for her next move. Her horn lit up, and a beam of pure magic shot out into the pulsating crystal, which started to grow brighter and hotter, enough to melt the snow it sat upon and boil it into steam within an instant. The ponies all started slowly backing away, but it was too late. The crystal exploded, sending a searing dome of energy out in all directions, and shards into a few of the peasants, whose wounds were seared from the heat. Three ponies were dead where they stood, and the rest were wounded, all except Magnit himself who only sighed, clasping his hooves together in prayer for the stars to accept the souls of the fallen peasants before taking out a notebook and calmly recording what had transpired, adding at the end."

newjaks.31.d:0 "A ruler can hardly reach their position of power alone, and further, they can hardly reach their highest point without someone by their side. But in Star Mountain's march to sate her eternal hunger for vengeance and fury, she hardly had the time to find someone who she could call her equal, let alone her love.\n\nToday was meant to change that, a great contest was being held in one of the larger city squares in Yakistown, and anyone who could be called anyone entered as soon as they could for her hoof in marriage. The day had started hopeful, with the certainty that by sunset, the Khatun would have met her muse, but so far, no one had even come close to clearing the high bar set for them.\n\nSome yaks displayed great feats of strength, seen only in some of the strongest bears of the Khaganate. Some griffons showed tremendous acts of courage and cunning through stunts and acrobatic performances. Even some exiles from Severyana themselves poured their hearts out to the Khatun, but their words fell on a hardened heart that wouldn't be softened. In the end, every single entry jumped their highest to at least hit the tops of their heads on the impossibly high bar, and few even saw it in their attempts to reach it.\n\nHundreds came and went from her gaze atop the high balcony, but none of them satisfied her. It was hard not to feel as far away from love as she was from any prospective partners, but then, this only made Star Mountain realize how this wasn't necessarily a bad thing. If no one could so much as stand in her shadow, then she must be a mare of singular peerlessness. This only lessened the sting of having to reject the last of the entrants, but it failed to fully remove it. Without a word, the Khatun left for her personal quarters alone, as she had so many other nights before."

newjaks.32.d:0 "Magnit Moonsong shivered at the biting cold of the mountain, his leathery wings feeling trapped beneath the heavy coat he was required to wear on this trek. Had the stars not required him to be away from his work once more, he would have happily been back at home continuing his research. Still, there was a job to do. Magnit trudged forward, followed by a gaggle of Polar Bear guides and Yak guards while the stars above lit his path, as they had throughout his journey into Onlartir.\n\nAt last the promised peak of the mountain came into view, holding the shadow of a seethrough throne and its inhabitant, surrounded by barely a dozen Panserbjørn guards. All at once the harsh winds that had buffeted the party for the last few weeks seemingly stopped, allowing them to approach without fear of taking a fall they may not come back from. As was proper, Magnit headed the approach as he cleared his throat.\n\n"Shaman King of Rozenkrantz. I come on behalf of the Khatun as her personal Harmonic Compliance Official, seeking your aid in the spreading of Harmony among these frozen lands, along with some personal aid for some experiments." Magnit hadn't technically received permission for the latter, but the stars knew this creature's help would be indisputable.\n\nThere was a long pause as the creature stilled, only his paws shifting to show his continued animation. Soon enough a faint light shone, as the already far off sounds of wind seemed to fade to the wayside and the Shaman King's voice spoke undeterred. "On behalf of your 'Khatun,' or on behalf of yourself, Mag-nit?"\n\nA slight eye-twitch came from the thestral, as the creature sounded his name out like it was from another language. Before he could respond, the Shaman King spoke once more. "That is answer enough. Tell your 'Khatun' she has my aid until her empire freezes over."\n\nMagnit was about to correct him on the term, before the faint light disappeared and along with it went the Shaman King. The familiar wind returned fiercer than before as the party started their journey back down the mountain."

The ramshackle shack barely shielded its inhabitants, though the wind did little to hide their raised voices.\n\nMagnit Moonsong, Harmonic Compliance Official on behalf of the Khatun, was busy shouting at a penguin barely half his size, who was in turn holding a comically large stick of dynamite, as a trio of other penguins watched carefully.\n\n"I'm utterly appalled..." Magnit sighed into his hoof, glaring at the explosive in the penguin's flipper. "How did you commoners get... that. The materials should have been impossible to acquire, let alone be used by commoners such as yourself."\n\nThe smallest of the three in the back raised his flipper, only to lower it at the shake of another penguin's head. After a moment of silence, the penguin who had previously 'made' the explosive started into a raspy tirade that the thestral could only hope was some obscure penguin language, and not just utter nonsense. The flailing that the creature used to expand on his 'story' lended credence to the latter.\n\n"Stop." The thestral growled, feeling his head hurt as the creature gestured like he was starting an invisible tank. "Just...tell me. Are you planning on attempting to commit treason against the Khatun and her harmonic state, and is at least one of you willing to serve in her armada?"\n\nThe creature looked as if it was about to launch another 'explanation' before another of the penguins coughed. "That's enough Rico, let me answer this one." Waddling forwards, with an air unfitting that of such a small creature, the penguin began. "Mister Magnet Moo Song, you don't need to worry about us. Our equipment is Pingland certified and unable to do any harm to your Yak leader, why I imagine they're just as lar-"\n\nMagnit heard a snap, and looked at the now shattered pencil in his hoof, huffing he returned a look at the wide-eyed penguin. "The Khatun is a pony, Admiral Skipper. And you still haven't answered my questions. You have two options, 'Yes' or 'No' to both."\n\nThe four penguins looked aghast at the thestral, before Skipper coughed to regain his composure with a sheepish smile."

The creature chided, sliding off of a large crate and throwing the newspaper he was reading over his shoulder. Wandering over to the batpony, the creature held out a claw. "Virgil, pleasure to meet you Sir...?"\n\nMagnit huffed and extended a leathery wing, the appendage giving a small shake before returning to his side and joining the rest of him in an unimpressed glare. "Magnit Moonsong, Harmonic Compliance Official on behalf of the Khatun. May I ask what in the stars' names you're doing here?" At the slight smile growing on the griffon's face, he clarified. "It's looking like a Celestia damned toll booth, and neither I nor the Khatun have been informed of its appearance!"\n\nThe feathery freak lent down and lightly patted the smaller thestral in an attempt to calm him down, though the smug grin splitting his beak simply irritated Magnit. "I wouldn't be so sure, Sir Mags. I had a lovely chat with your 'Khatun' just the other day, in fact." At the derisive snort from the batpony, the bandit lightly shook his head and grabbed a sheet of parchment from a nearby desk. "See?"\n\nBlinking, Magnit read through the document. His eyes traced over each word, comparing the style with the scant few times he saw the Khatun writing in the past. Sure enough, it was... eloquent enough to be hers, though that was likely just the griffish it was written in bleeding through to the style.\n\nAt the light cough of the other creature, Magnit turned away sheepishly. "Ah. I may have been mistaken, t-though that does not change too much." He nodded to himself. "You may have permission, yes, but only nobility can exercise this level of power in the Khatun's realm. From your..." The thestral hesitated to say 'appearance.' "...l-lack of a family name, I see no proof as to why you should be here!"\n\nThe smug smile never fell from the griffon's beak as he pointed to the bottom of the page. "Looks can be deceiving, Sir Mags." Following his claw, Magnit noted a second signature."

Was it anxiety? Impossible, the Khatun feared nothing! Was it unworthiness? No one on the planet could be more worthy. Perhaps it was... Guilt.\n\nAs she looked out into the blanket of fresh, powdery snow across the spanning lawn, she replayed the memories of her brother and sister chasing her across the grass, or playing as knights with sticks in their mouths, or playing with the servants as they tended to the laundry. But just as soon as the vision came, it was gone, and only the eerie silence and emptiness remained.\n\nThe filth that had murdered Star's parents and her sister at least had the decency to bury them on the land as per his last will and testimony, and as Star Mountain made her way behind the mansion, trying not to make eye contact with the mausoleum to her childhood in a country which no longer existed. But as she drew nearer down the row of apple trees that stood on either side of a pathway to the graves, she felt her stomach drop.\n\nA whirlwind of sorrow and guilt and pain, building like a typhoon within her for years since leaving the home, fully brought itself to bear just inches from the graves. If only she were stronger, she could've done something to save her family. If only she were more careful, her brother didn't have to die. If only fate was a little more fair, it would've taken her instead.\n\nHer sobs began to fill the air, her large frame heaving with every gasping breath and trembling wail, none of which calmed the maelstrom raging within her. Step softly, a dream lies buried here. The words on her sister's grave snapped something within Star Mountain, the storm within her suddenly caught fire and eviscerated any semblance of sadness. Her lips pursed into a sour line, the task ahead of her coming perfectly into view. Fate wasn't fair, but she became the instrument of fate."

She didn't even have her cutie mark yet! Who wouldn't hate living under the hoof of two tyrants like that? They only stopped after I begged them to, and the horror of it all was so great that the filly was stunned into silence.'\n\n'When the Revolution reaches Zvezdopadovo, my one hope is that Burushka and Seva aren't caught up in its flames.

She stared out into the immense archival building, the rows of empty tables and towering ceilings that held nothing, and couldn't help but feel just as hollow. Her own flesh and blood...

What if her entire crusade was based on lies?\n\nWhat if every drop of blood shed in their name was for nothing?\n\nThe unending fire in her subsided, and for perhaps the first time in her life, Star Mountain didn't feel any rage, any thirst for revenge, or ambition."

The fire that had propelled the Khatun this far refused to go out without a fight and kickstarted the rage back to the forefront of her mind like a defibrillator. The hotter it burned, the clearer the conclusion became.\n\nSure, her parents flogged the serfs, but they never did so without a reason, and besides, a couple of lashings in exchange for housing and steady work seemed like a good trade anyway. Sure, her family may have earned a bit of animosity from the socialists, but the majority of it was entirely unjustified and fabricated. Sure, Sveta sympathized with the reds, but she was naive and misplaced her bountiful mercy. The journal had just proven the maliciousness of Stalliongrad, she gave them her sympathy, and they repaid her with a bullet.\n\nMore than that, Severyana gave those fetid peasants everything, and they repaid their homeland by taking up arms against it with an army built from lies! They've bitten the hoof that's fed them their whole lives, and then expect compassion? They slaughter the families of so many, and expect mercy? Where was the mercy for Sveta? For Mama and Papa? For Seva dying in his bed? No, they have not given any semblance of compassion, so they will not be spared the full wrath of the Khaganate.\n\nStar Mountain rose to her hooves with a wicked sneer stretched across her face. In one fluid motion, she closed the journal and tucked it into her coat before marching towards the twin glass front doors. She'd found the answer she'd been after within the inferno and the frenzy that had always been there. That was now in control. Its name was Star Mountain, the last of her line, the hungry ghost, and she will bring a sweeping wave of death upon the land and purge the blight of socialism from the land!"

Within the headquarters of what used to be the People's Department of Security in Stalliongrad was now a building between purposes, and today, that was sifting through every shred of evidence leveled against the secret police since the revolution. "This one here said that a group of PDS officers made the owners of a coal mine play catch with a live grenade, and then they simply shot the last one standing."\n\n"Yeah, I can hardly believe them either," Blind Side, one of Star Mountain's best friends, rolled her eyes, snatching up a page in the center of the long table she and a few other top advisors sat around, "I mean, some of these are just complete fabrications, there's no way they forced a peach plantation owner to play piano for thirty hours straight, only to shoot him when he stopped."\n\n"Well you best start believing them," Dasha Solepyeraya slammed her hoof into the table and commanded the attention of everyone in the chamber. The look in her eyes was somehow fiercer than ten hawks, but more distant than the horizon, "I saw PDS officers enable a group of serfs to steal a manor away from its owners and force them to work until they died from exhaustion."\n\nThe tension in the room was as heavy as it was preposterous. Blind Side didn't know whether to feel baffled or afraid, and casting a glance between Dasha and her friend the Khatun was like looking between a giant and a titan, both of whom were strangers. "My dear Dasha, there's no need for such hostility. Stalliongrad lay dead beneath our hooves, and the PDS that terrorized our great people are no longer free to act." Now the two were locked in each other's gaze, allowing Blind to rise from her seat and tuck it back in place. "Every atrocity will be paid back threefold, and this is the evidence we'll use to do it."\n\n"Say the word, Khatun, and I will make terror the order of the day!"

Adrenaline shot through her veins and jolted her fully into the moment, her opponent, Torben of Clan Svartpels, didn't give her a moment to rest in their friendly sparring match and charged straight forward while reeling back to prepare the next blow.\n\nExpecting where it would land, Star Mountain waited for the immense bear to get close enough to where he couldn't correct his aim, and ducked beneath his paw and wrapped her hooves around it before using the punch's momentum to flip the beast onto his back. "Not bad, Khatun." Torben's low voice rumbled as he returned to his paws, lowering his head in an intense glare. "You're a living example of your race's highest strength."\n\n"I could say the same for you, Torben," Star growled back, adjusting her mouth from the damage it'd taken moments before, "I only wish the same could be said for griffons."\n\nTorben lunged forth, swiping a set of long claws at his sparring partner, who readily pulled her head back to dodge. "Just as you are approaching the limit of an equine's size and might, griffons accepted into our clan do the same. We call them owlbears."\n\n"The strong protect the weak, Torben." Star shifted her weight entirely to her front hooves and readied a deadly buck of her hooves back into the bear, only for him to jump out of the way, panting. "Then it follows that those of nobility in our society should be strong enough to protect those beneath them, who better to stand for Harmony than the best examples a race can provide?"\n\n"I couldn't have said it better myself." Torben reoriented his body and hauled back to throw another punch, with Star Mountain mirroring the movement. The two collided with a force strong enough to send a shockwave into the ground and kick up a plume of snow. The two stared intensely at one another, almost trying to bore a hole through the other with their stare before Star smiled and Torben broke out into laughter."

newjaks.40.d:0 "Everything hurt. Black Gold could hardly see anything out of his one eye that wasn't swollen shut, and his thick grey fur hid any bruises from the dozens of cameras he was wheeled out in front of on a bloody gurney. Gagged and restrained, even though he didn't possess the energy to fight off his bonds if he tried, Black Gold was forced to stand trial in front of a false nation for crimes he was beaten into confessing.\n\n"You know, you communists are like a rotten tooth." The judge was blurry from where Gold was sitting, but his voice was unmistakably coarse like gravel falling down the side of a quarry. "You cause so much pain, so much frustration, and yet when we finally pull you out, you're so small and weak that it's baffling you were ever capable of such agony."\n\nHe couldn't see it very well, but he swore the judge was posing for the cameras. Black Gold was one of the last in tens of thousands of sham trials that all ended with the same verdict. Most were old bureaucrats, some were old officers, and some, like Gold, were just vocal clerks. The stallion closed his one good eye and thought of home. That old musty apartment with creaky boards and a ceiling that leaked, and an upstairs neighbor that loved to stomp and snore. He hated the place when he was living there, but now he'd give anything to spend one more night there with his wife and two fillies. The last he knew, they had boarded a ship to Equestria, but if he knew the barbarians in charge, and the pain in his body reminded him that he did, they probably blew up the boat anyway.\n\n"It's truly a miscarriage of justice that the worst punishment I can pass down for your crimes is death," there was that damned judge again, "but for the crime of terrorism, treason, and conspiracy to overthrow the government, this court finds you guilty and orders you to be shot immediately."\n\nHe'd barely been in the courtroom long enough to let the soreness crying out from his wounds to fade into dull throbbing, but before he knew it, he was carted off out of the courtroom and put before a firing line of soldiers. None of them looked very old, which was just another tragedy added on top of the spectacle. After looking each of his executioners in the eye, he closed his for a final time and thought once more of creaking boards and leaking ceilings."

newjaks.41.t:0 "Justice"
newjaks.41.d:0 "First came the broadcasts over the radio and the television that the Khaganate had decided the majority of the population was under the spell of a nefarious and invisible 10% who controlled the people in an equally undetectable way. For every act of open resistance, the Khatun declared over the radio with a voice like fire coming through the speakers, there were a hundred more that could not be seen, and therefore could not be punished.\n\nAlmost overnight, individuals ceased to be friends and began to be suspects, not out of any genuine mistrust, but out of fear that if they weren't openly hostile to those close to them, they might be suspected themselves of being within that slim ten percent. Neighbor against neighbor, coworker against coworker, and brother against brother, the reports began to flood the local garrisons, often full of complete fabrications or outright hyperbole.\n\nThen came the soldiers, thousands of them marching in lockstep before splitting off into their designated streets. The Khatun said that any town that failed to turn over ten percent of their population to rid the nation of the virus would be treated like 'a cancerous appendage to be severed to protect the vital organ of the state.' All at once, taking a page out of the Ghenikhan slaughter, officers dragged those in the reports, sometimes entire families from the same household, out of their homes and into the streets, kicking, and screaming. From there, they were force-marched out from their cities or towns to any given local body of water, which more often than not was frozen over, and forced to stand atop the ice. Without warning, an explosion from beneath the bruised and crying masses blew a hole in the ice and sent those who weren't killed by the blast tumbling into the freezing water below. Most drowned within minutes.\n\nSeveryana was in tears, a cruel surgery performed on it with little forewarning and no anesthetic that would leave a deep and terrible scar. Mothers were crying when their sons were pried from their hooves, but it was ultimately for their own good. It's tragic to lose someone, and that wasn't lost on every soldier who carried out their orders, but it's even more tragic to let them enslave the people and undermine the nation. In time, everyone would come to thank the Khatun for doing what they were too weak to do."

newjaks.42.d:0 ""I'm finding it hard to feel the full gravity of the reports coming in." Star Mountain craned her head up while speaking to her friend, Blind Side, who was riding on her backside as she had when they were both younger and living in Yakyakistan together. The smaller mare was finding it harder to recognize what Severyana, or her best friend, was becoming, but days like this when they could speak frankly with one another did wonders. "After a while, they just become numbers on a page and not an actual death."\n\nIt was a perfectly cloudless day in the city of Princessyn, with a lovely backing track of bustling city dwellers and the odd songbird's call, and hearing those words coming from the Khatun nearly sent her tumbling off her back. "I'm... Actually delighted to hear you say that, Star!" She tapped her hoof twice against the horned helmet just beneath her, "And here I was starting to think you enjoyed the act of kill—"\n\nBefore Blind Side could finish her sentence, they rounded a corner onto the largest main square in the city, and there in plain view was a towering off-white structure reaching towards the sky itself. She wasn't familiar with such a fixture, but with every step closer, she began to see its material.\n\nThe bottom supporting layer of the pyramid were hundreds of the thick, haunting skulls of former socialist yaks, and moving up the chain were the skulls of ponies and griffons before the final layer of penguin remains. Some of them had holes between the eyes, while others had large chunks missing as though that part had been clubbed out, but all of them stared back into Blind Side with their empty, lifeless eye sockets. Every pair of dead eyes staring at her weighed her down as though she'd just picked up a mountain, and were she any weaker of a pony, she would've emptied the entire contents of her stomach on the sidewalk.\n\n"Oh, of course, I don't enjoy killing anyone, I wouldn't want to associate with someone who did!" The cheery voice of the Khatun only made the terror pounding in her friend's chest worse. "But like I was saying, I didn't want anyone to go numb to those numbers on the page, and by making monuments like this in every village in Severyana, no one could ever forget. And besides, it'll be a welcome sight! Almost like a monument to victory!""

newjaks.43.d:0 "The alarm blared from the nightstand next to Khulgana's bed, but she was already awake long before its set time staring blankly up into an equally blank ceiling. Barely emotion had run through her heart since the day her first son was taken away for being a communist sympathizer, and less since her second as part of the 10% 'contribution' her village had to provide. The only fragment of feeling left was hope that her third son who had been conscripted a year ago would return home.\n\nUntil then, her life was a grueling struggle of working twelve-hour shifts, sometimes for fourteen hours, six days a week, and returning home to barely any food and because of the gnawing, twisting pain of hunger in her stomach that never seemed to cease, barely any sleep either. She wondered rather morbidly as she rolled out of bed and into the kitchen, if she would die from being overworked or if her son would return home in a casket first and break her heart enough to join him.\n\nThe warm memory of the carnival Khulgana had taken them to felt more like a repeating curse in her mind that haunted her, and in this way, even her own memories weren't safe from the Khatun's sick, deranged actions. Before she earned more than enough money to support her family, but now, despite having no dependents and working more hours, she could barely afford oats or potatoes to eat. What little food she was able to buy had to be rationed, so as to be hungry all day rather than sated in the morning and starving at night.\n\nThe stress and fatigue were so great that days flowed into each other like water over eroding sand. Downing the small portion of oats, Khulgana simply departed out of her front door to another day in an unending nightmare to do what she had done best for the past several years."

newjaks.44.d:0 "The door that led into Perfect Score's classroom was one of the rare joys left in what was becoming of the so-called Khaganate, but now, the Khatun had even come for that. Suddenly, that door became a portal to an entirely foreign dimension with iron rules and dire consequences. Just yesterday, every teacher in the district was sat down in a neighboring town's gymnasium and given the news of a new education program Star Mountain had created.\n\nMathematics, sciences, history, the arts, and anything else in the curriculum was to be sharply cut down and replaced with a regiment of lessons on service, duty, and above all, loyalty to the state and the Khatun. Now Perfect Score's precious classroom, a sanctuary away from the insanity outside its walls, had mutated into a center for the brainwashing of the youth, and worse, she was the one forced to do it.\n\nShe rested her hoof gently against the brass knob of her homeroom, breathing in the last breath of free air and allowing her students to do the same, before pushing the door open. Perfect Score colourlessly set the new lesson plans on her front desk, which faced out toward the twenty other smaller ones, before turning around and erasing the week's unit on basic algebra. It pained the teacher to listen to the noise of her class quiet down, as though the last bits of liberty were draining from them like the last grains of sand in an hourglass.\n\n"Alright, students," Perfect Score began, hoping they couldn't hear the trembling in her saccharine voice as she steeled herself and spun to face the children, "I know many of you were just starting to understand basic equations, but our great Khatun has asked me to switch things up to more important matters."\n\nPicking up a piece of chalk with her magic, Perfect Score wrote the word, 'Discipline' across the wide whiteboard in big letters. "Dith-a-pline?" Melon Rind, one of her brighter and frailer students asked from the front row.\n\nPerfect Score nodded, imagining a rope slipping around her own neck if she botched any of these lessons, "That's right! Now, I need all of you to stand and line up against the wall, and we're going to race back into our seats as fast as we can until we can do it in no time!""

For a moment, he could pretend as though the country hadn't gone to complete madness, and that he'd waltz into the kitchen to cook himself a full meal and enjoy his only day off.\n\nThen Double Decker opened his eyes and the bare ceiling stared back at him. He shifted, trying to glean even an ounce of comfort and finding only a damp pool of sweat beneath him, only serving to enrage him further. Seeing that there was nothing to be gained from sleeping in, the short, silver stallion got up, scooped his wallet from the nightstand, and headed out, making sure to throw on a ratty coat as he did.\n\nThe city was beyond unrecognizable, as though the 'Khatun', or whatever that madmare called herself anymore, had personally warped every feature Stalliongrad had into a bizarre vision of itself. Except now, he couldn't even call the city by its actual name anymore! The street names were all different, every building was either renovated or defaced to remove all socialist imagery, and worst of all, it was a crime to slip up and refer to any of them by their old 'illegal' names.\n\nIt used to be bearable too, before his wife got conscripted as a garrison officer and shipped out halfway across the country to guard a prison. Rage, frustration, and despair grew every day since then, building pressure in the fragile bottle that was Double Decker's psyche. Everything came to a head when he passed a taller mare who happened to bump into him, sending a spiderweb of cracks across his mind, "Pardon me," the words hurled from his mouth like projectiles, "You wouldn't happen to know how to get to Marks Memorial Row, do you? I'm looking for the fish market."\n\nThe blonde mare before him looked equal parts stunned and frightened, frantically looking over either of her shoulders before spotting an officer on the corner behind the senile stallion, and motioning them over with their head. "You heard it here, folks! I'm a regular socialist here in Stalliongrad! I keep a secret stash of theory under my bed!" The bottle containing his fury had completely blown apart.

Most were polar bears, larger than average, but a few numbered among them were hulking griffons called Owlbears, but all of them were the motley army that had invaded the northernmost tundras of the Khaganate.\n\nOne among their ranks stood out, wearing a calculating expression on his sharp face, likely the leader. He approached without hesitation, the snow crunching beneath his paws, causing every soldier behind the Khatun to spring to life and draw their arms, which in turn caused every bear to lower their heads in preparation for combat. "Greetings, Star Mountain, I am called Bjornling." His voice was low and smooth, like oil pooling out from clear ice. His wide arms swung behind him as he spoke, gesturing to the mountain rising out from the otherwise flat tundra, or more specifically, the large wooden door embedded into its side. "I hope you can forgive my aggression, but I knew no better way to get a warrior's attention, such as yourself. Won't you come in for a feast?"\n\nStar Mountain tilted her head, clearly the suave ursine didn't think she was stupid enough to fall for a trap, and inversely, he must be smart enough not to set one for her. "For what purpose?" The towering mare's gravelly voice cut straight through Bjornling's vocal silk, "What's so important you have to drag me out here?"\n\n"The future!" A curious grin flashed across Bjornling's face, as though he were concealing as many feelings as he was displaying, "Give me a half hour, and I will give you the future of Harmony."\n\n"Oh yeah?" Star Mountain snorted, eyeing the ursine up and down with a smirk of her own, "I already know what lies ahead for Harmony and it's in the unshakeable U.P.A. But I'll tell you what, Bjornling, I like your attitude, and frankly, I get a good feeling from you. You have twenty minutes, and if I find that you've wasted my time or set a trap for me, you and yours are finished."\n\n"I wouldn't be so sure about the U.P.A."

newjaks.47.t:0 "The Strangest Request of All"
newjaks.47.d1:0 "An orderly set of three knocks rang through Celestia's study, the set Luna preferred her guards use to announce herself. In response, a golden sliver of magic wrapped around the double doors, slowly creaking them open to reveal the Celestial Alicorn, lit up by both her glowing horn and the setting sun.\n\n"Good evening Sister, why did you call for me?" Luna entered, settling neatly beside her sister. Adjusting to the room's light, she could see a letter left open on Celestia's desk, the hoofwriting barely legible and a small smiley face in the corner. Just as she was about to ask if it was a foal's letter, the sun set below the horizon and the room's lights flicked on, revealing the extremely weary face of the Solar Princess.\n\n"Luna, I received an odd request from the 'Northern Neighbor' I've been telling you about." Her voice was a lot more curt than usual, and as she spoke her hair flickered inconsistently. Luna instinctively reached a hoof out, but her sister had already teleported to her desk. Picking up the letter in her magic, she stared daggers at the paper. "She wants to join the [EQS.GetFactionName]."\n\nLuna stared at her sister like she'd gone mad. "You're not seriously considering it, Sister?" Celestia turned to her, her tired eyes scanning over Luna. "Need I remind you that you were the one who had to read every report of her actions in Severyana, and meet with as many ponies who managed to escape her realm as you could just to verify their stories?"\n\nThe Princess of the Sun, the architect of the Pax Celestia and she who ruled alone for a thousand years, lay silent for a minute, looking right back at her sister before turning towards the letter. "...No. No, you're...you're right. I failed Severyana once, I cannot fail it again." A quill rose from her desk, dancing across the letter with a few sharp lines detailing a quick and blunt response. Soon enough, the quill stilled, and her magic faded, leaving Celestia standing there. Her expression betraying just how much the issue had drained her as she stumbled towards her sister.\n\n"Thank you Sister, truly. No matter my distaste for the mistaken beliefs of Caramel Marks' foals, having them as a neighbor was far better than... that creature." Luna held her hooves out for Celestia to collapse into, a blue hue catching the letter as it fell and sending it away.\n\nA blast of dragonfire sounded, as both of Equestria's protectors wrapped their hooves around one another."
newjaks.47.d2:0 "Celestia's study was lit by dragon fire, the unfortunately familiar visage of the mare on the moon blocked out by the thickest curtains Canterlot could provide. On her desk sat a letter, one she'd read over and over the last few hours, trying to make sense of the broken ponish.\n\nAs the words span around her mind, the pure absurdity of the request hit her again and again. This creature wanted to join the [EQS.GetFactionName]. The reports from former Severyana and flyovers from pegasi spotters clearly showed exactly what reprehensible actions they'd committed, in the name of some twisted form of 'Harmony.'\n\nWhy was she even entertaining the idea? No matter the threat the Communists were to Equestria, the unparalleled extremes this creature could commit heartlessly was enough to secure her a seat in Tartarus.\n\nBut she made an earnest offer to join the [EQS.GetFactionName]. Was it a trick? A way to ruin her legitimacy? Some way of infiltration to subvert her ideals from within?\n\nCould it even have been entirely honest? Was this creature genuinely delusional in her obsession over some strange strain of Harmony, or is this some way for Harmony to check whether she'll choose the safety of her little ponies over the safety of Harmony itself...\n\nWhat even was this Khatun at the top of it all? Why did they breathe life as easily as they took it? How could they even sleep at night?\n\nDid she even have any similarity with the filly this hoof-writing reminded her of? Or is this creature simply a monster in frozen skin, mimicking the mannerisms and form of some poor creature it destroyed and devoured decades ago?\n\n...Why was she even entertaining the idea? Objective facts had to guide her hoof. Pony, Yak, Griffon, Bear, Windigo, whatever this creature was it had to go back to Tartarus where it deserved to lay.\n\nSo why...why was it so hard to pick up her quill?"
newjaks.47.d3:0 "The faint crackling of fire, soft hum of magic and dramatic sighing were the only sounds that filled Daybreaker's throne room. The aforementioned Empress almost lounging on her throne with a letter encased in her magic as her retinue of guards stood stock still and silent by the walls. Every so often she'd lean up to glare at the letter, before laying back once more in contemplation.\n\nMost of the letter was clear, if slightly poor, ponish. A request for an alliance from somecreature further north, who seemed to have an appropriate level of reverence towards her. Any level of response would be able to clear up all the administrative trouble of the inevitable conquest and/or total domination of this creature's uppity empire, or 'Khaganate' as the letter put it, but something didn't feel right about it.\n\nThe Empress' reports on the frozen realm weren't glowing, showing an unknown yet frankly absurd death count from her takeover of Severyana, which robbed her of future subjects. Villages leveled, pyramids of skulls made, so on and so forth.\n\nQuite frankly it was an idiotic way of running things, but this creature bending the knee would be enough to forgive that, at least until she could have them dealt with and replaced with a slightly more stable figurehead for the region under her hoof.\n\nStill, as she waved the letter back and forth, shaking off the occasional singe as her tail idly flicked over it, she couldn't help but feel a distaste for the request. The deaths were one thing, but as she looked closely at the increasingly spotty paper, she found her answer.\n\nThe one part of the letter that wasn't written, but instead a small smiley face.\n\nWas this a joke? A jape? Some kind of disrespectful sigil that laughed at her even considering being merciful with this creature?! The rest of the letter was reverent enough, even if it did refer to her as Celestia, or some misspelling of it, at least once.\n\nTaking a breath to calm herself and allowing her flames to recede, Daybreaker stared at the charred letter. Try as she might, she couldn't contemplate it forever. She did have to send a response at some point, though a positive one would definitely come with a few...additions for this 'Star Mountain' to accept."

In any case, the task we've been working towards has been accomplished, and in its place stands a newer and more important duty to uphold the light of Harmony from all those who seek to extinguish it!

Star Mountain stood from her desk, shambled to her personal chambers, and collapsed into bed. About as soon as her head hit the pillow, tears started flowing for the first time since she'd arrived in Yakyakistan all those years ago as a filly, both of whom had nothing left anymore.\n\nA thought shot across her mind just before she fully gave herself over to misery: Star Mountain had never betrayed Harmony, not for an instant in her life, in fact, she'd only ever fought for it. But by allowing Caramel Marks to preach a gospel of poison, and envy, and death, Princess Celestia aided the socialists in their cause. More than this, she gave quiet approval to the socialists who stormed across Severyana slaughtering everyone who dared disagree with their tyranny! At every turn, Princess Celestia had aided communism at the expense of Harmony. Star Mountain wasn't a traitor, the Princess was.\n\nThe Khatun sprung from her bed and marched to the tall mirror standing at the foot of her bed and looked deep into the red, puffy eyes of a warrior.

Hundreds of thousands of soldiers from every part of the nation marched in rehearsed lockstep towards their destination, some with fury in their hearts and others with prayers that they could make it home. Some were volunteers, most were conscripts.\n\nLeading them, calling a grim cadence of carnage and brutality, was none other than Star Mountain herself, who after marching with them from Princessyn uninterrupted, suddenly called for the army to halt. With another two sets of uniform stomps, silence reigned over the land of snow. The Khatun took several bounding steps away from her troops before turning to face them, tapping a small device mounted to her neck which, through a clever enchantment, amplified her voice to carry for nearly a mile in every direction.\n\n"Fall in!" Her voice sent a shockwave across the ground, kicking up snow all around her as though it trembled just from the sound, as every soldier fell into their position of an audience before the madmare. Star's eyes swept across the army just as a cold wind picked up and did the same, both inspecting their mettle. "From leading the warbands against the communist Prince Rutherford, to the campaigns in the east to reclaim our rightful territory from the griffons, to the liberation of Severyana itself, I have commanded this army for one purpose alone: The protection of Harmony!"\n\nWith every one of her words, an echo could be heard in the distance. Steam flowed off Star Mountain's colossal body, a testament to the wrath flowing through her veins as she spoke. "Today, I have gathered you all for a different purpose." She stomped, causing a mare in the front row of troops, nearly a quarter of the Khatun's size, to flinch. "Equestria as we know it has fallen. It is no longer the unbreakable bastion of Harmony. We are. Our mission, however, remains."\n\nThe wind picked up into a shrill howl, parting the mist billowing off of Star Mountain, "We are not merely marching to liberate a nation or its people, today, we will march to rescue the principle of Harmony itself, just as the Princesses would want!"

If only Sveta and Seva could see her now.\n\nSitting on a red plush pillow on the balcony overlooking tens of thousands of anxious, murmuring spectators was a new royal gorget emblazoned with a simple butterfly. The unmistakable sigil of Harmony forged specifically for her reign. With one final look at the reflection, she steeled herself and walked out, feeling the weight of history with every step. Instantly, a wave of silence washed over the crowd as dozens of cameras and microphones spontaneously fixed on the Khatun.\n\nEvery town in the country looked at her, and it felt as though a thread suspended the entire nation, and Star Mountain was about to grab it and hoist it to its highest point. "My subjects, I do not wish to waste my time mincing words about the fall of Equestria, or the failure of the Princesses to protect it. As a result of their failure, the task of rescuing and upholding Harmony has fallen from the hooves of the eternal alicorns into mine."\n\nStar Mountain swung her gaze from the crowd to the cameras themselves and flashed a toothy grin as whispers grew amongst the people again, their voices sounding like the hissing of a viper pit, "But have no fear, subjects of the new Equestrian Khaganate, for Harmony has no better guardian than myself. As I am now, I lack the power of the Princesses to rule over such a vast realm, but..."\n\nWithout delay, the Khatun turned and plucked the gorget from its resting place and gently placed it around her neck. A storm of noise and anger surged from the thousands of spectators and hurled itself up at her, but Star Mountain only glared back, intent to meet their rage and break it against her own.

A gentle thud accompanied the Khatun as she marched across the red carpet that led to a lone violet seat, the Crystal Throne. Gathered around it were a few dozen journalists from across the country, and some from across the major cities of the Khaganate, joined on the other side of the carpet by the most loyal generals of the regime. The order of the day was owed to a chance find by a lowly clerk in the newly occupied Crystal Empire.\n\nBoth sides of the carpet began to chitter amongst themselves as Star Mountain passed them, and without much delay, squeezed herself into the throne designed for a much smaller mare than herself, causing silence to fall over the room. The Khatun slowly took off her helmet and placed it on her lap as she glanced between the reporters and her generals, frowning when she realized the clerk wasn't in attendance.\n\n"I've gathered you all here today because I have the most wonderful news!" She beamed with an uncharacteristically cheerful expression. "Yesterday, I received word that my ancestry traces all the way back to the time of Princess Amore herself in the ancient Crystal Empire. Do you know what this means?"\n\nNo one in the room knew how to handle the joy coming from the otherwise brutal, seemingly joyless mare, and chose to answer her with apprehensive stares. "It means!" She squealed, jumping up from her seat, "That I'm a legitimate ruler over the Crystal Empire! I'd even go so far as to claim the title of Princess of these most beautiful lands! Wouldn't you all agree?"\n\nAs though the small audience was waiting for their cue, the journalists stamped at the ground halfheartedly, while the generals cheered, drowning out any lack of enthusiasm. Regardless of what they actually felt, everyone knew better than to question the Khatun, besides, there was a good chance that her claims were valid."

newjaks.53.d:0 "Every part of Ocellus' body throbbed with a dull pain as she struggled to catch her breath, each pant sending out a puff of steam from her mouth. The mines of the far north were bitterly cold above ground, and somehow even more agonizing beneath it. If the soreness, the aching of her muscles, or the gnawing hunger in her stomach wasn't enough, the icy cold felt like a thousand needles piercing her carapace.\n\nThe blue-finned changeling's lip quivered, threatening to spill forth another round of sobs, but she was stronger now than she was a month ago when she'd been ripped from her college dorm room and stuffed down here. Instead, Ocellus thought of her dorm room, the treasured friends she left behind, the studies she'd never get to read again, and suddenly all of her pain was burnt up as fuel for her anger.\n\nEvery memory of laughter was another hard swing of the pickaxe that yielded a little more raw ore, and every interesting fact of history was a trip to the cart that hauled off her work. Ironically, Ocellus had been studying the history of her home country before she'd been forced to labor in the all-but-forgotten caste system. Chrysalis, in her nationalist fervor, had slain the Royal Males that used to run it in favor of a more efficient, meritocratic war machine. This was evidence enough for the madmare, Star Mountain, that Chrysalis was actually a communist, and her work must be swiftly undone.\n\nIt felt as though Ocellus were living through the nightmare of the past with every moment, and it was impossible to say anything against that, the barely-lit tunnels were stained with those dumb enough to make that mistake. The only protest the student had left was in the brief moments of respite and the memories that any regime couldn't touch. Some part of her held out hope, along with the hundreds of those struggling alongside her, that just as this old system ended long ago, and Chrysalis' reign was ended, that this too would pass.\n\nBut a louder part taunted Ocellus and told her that she would do nothing but break rocks until she died. None of them had anything left except their work..."

newjaks.54.d:0 "The rush of hot smoke filling Star Mountain's lungs sent them into revolt, and despite not inhaling much from the Elder's pipe, she was sent into a coughing fit. Rather than being offended, the massive, old buffalo couldn't help but laugh at his newfound companion. All around the two was nothing but lush grass with wildflowers peppered throughout the expanse, and just before the horizon sat a beautiful beach with shimmering water lit against the setting red sun.\n\n"I have seen much change throughout this land from when I was a calf, and if it weren't for strong creatures like you and me, communism would have taken over all of it." The Elder's voice was low, and his cadence was slow, as though every word were being pulled through a thick layer of syrup.\n\nStar Mountain nodded enthusiastically, still caught in a series of tiny sputtering coughs as she passed the pipe back to her friend, "I wish most of my citizens would see things the way you did, the way things actually are." Finally, the coughing ceased, and the large mare slipped her helmet off and held it in her lap. "If everyone loved their homeland as much as you and I do, communism would never have a chance."\n\nThe Elder stroked his hoof along the length of his beard, a gentle stream of smoke pouring forth from his nose, "Look around you, Princess Star Mountain, every bit of beauty you see here, every blade of grass and every grain of sand is appreciated. It's not seized by some false state to fund a doomed struggle against 'reaction', or whatever it is the reds prattle on about. I have you to thank for this."\n\nCrickets began to sing their song, accented by a sparse chorus of locusts hiding somewhere in the brush, and Star Mountain drank in the sight as though it were wine. "If the land stays this pristine under your care, then that is all the thanks I require.""

Star Mountain, the leader of a bloodied, and brutal Khaganate has extended a hoof of friendship towards us, even offering all of our lost lands, in exchange for the reformation of our country into a Khaganate like theirs.\n\nThis offer seems to be just as much of a blessing as it does a curse, as it grants us our ancestral lands back to us, and protection within the Khatun's faction, but by the same token, we would have to alter ourselves into a mirror image of them. No doubt this would cause great unrest, and possibly even bloodshed, but we mustn't dismiss their envoy even despite that.\n\nAfter a long series of back-and-forths within our administration, the following conclusion has been reached."

Stood at the end of it all, across miles of radios, television sets, banners, and soldiers was Star Mountain herself, looking down at the spoils of all her efforts. She couldn't help but grin, which turned into a wicked sneer, which turned into a muted giggle the microphones, ears across the nation, barely picked up.\n\n"Equus, lend me your ear!" Her voice boomed across every speaker in Equus, and even more across the oceans in Griffonia and North Zebrica, "Today we all stand perched at the dawn of a new age for the continent, and as the sun rises tomorrow, we will all wake up in a new Khaganate, led by a new Empress."\n\nDiscontent was already the default state for any spectator, but her words had sparked a flame in them that began to heat up the more Star Mountain spoke. "You have not misheard me. Chrysalis is gone, Stalliongrad is vanquished, and the Princesses have proven their abandonment to Harmony and have run across the ocean to New Mareland." Hotter, approaching a boiling point. "In other words, my little ponies, the powers of socialism in all their wicked, infectious ways could not defeat me. No one could, and no one will. Starting tomorrow, the ports, the airplanes, and any other path some of you might think of using to escape will be cut off."\n\nThe populace all across the country, but especially in front of the Empress began to hiss and move like steam escaping from a kettle. They were about to explode. "For any of you who think that they will defy Harmony, you and your family will meet the same end that every other enemy to that most sacred ideal has. If you incur the Khaganate's wrath, then there will be nothing to save you from it."\n\nStar Mountain's words deflated as much as they incinerated, for every flash of anger within the hearts of millions, its heat evaporated their remaining wellsprings of hope they had. There was nowhere safe, there was nothing else, and no one was coming to save them. "However, I will save you all from yourselves. I will lift you up with true Harmony into the ones you were always meant to be, even if I have to force the better way upon you like a scolding mother. I am the Empress of all Equus, and you all are in my embrace.""

newjaks.57.d:0 "Vitality had surged through the horde which, like a swift blizzard, engulfed the mountain ridge, every road and home. Rutherford's yurts twisted into smog and smokestacks; factories and firearms stronghoofed despairing griffons under another's banner. The unusual polar creatures? Harnessed for the strength and intelligence that the yaks sometimes had use for as speeding walls of flesh in battle.\n\nThe unruly often discovered fur, feathers, and pelts in crimson-stained clumps more often than not. This wasn't fear, not when the airwaves conveyed the khan's assurances. Moved by memories of passed-down sagas, he'd been spurred by the imagination of strength: the land lay open for the taking, and it was fruitful, and so the only armies that mattered—his—would take it. The rest of the continent would be answered to, from the alpines to the jungles: the north would subsume the south.\n\nThe north at his back was in the past.

They heralded the incoming union of two yaks who'd dared not deign to use a vehicle to arrive at this venue: endurance was its own strength, the strength to brave a hundred miles in the night... together.\n\nUnder the rising sun, the khan and the bandit would have each piece of armour fitted on their legs, around their barrels—a slow assembly of what might as well be mobile fortresses. The weight of their wedding attire drained not an ounce of energy; knowing glances and mighty hoof-bumps that clanked metal were sometimes shared.\n\nChants that stretched the limits of one's throat served as the backdrop to the couple slaughtering griffons (or their life-like imitations) with blade and arrow, flourished with gallons of tea and platefuls of pastries, which culminated in Kerr's and Yakkenkova's vows pronounced over a ceremonial exchange of their weapons.\n\nWith the deed done, the sprawling audience—most of whom had donned similar armour, and the changelings themselves couldn't resist coming in with their commanding suits and hats—stood to raise their guns and blades high to pierce the clear blue sky."

His hoof wildly gestured at the many sources of distant crackling and explosions: firestorms across villages ripe for the taking, crystalline and socialist-inspired structures alike falling down as one by one, their lights went out. Ecstatic cheers could be discerned, followed by the tiny earthquakes of yak stomping. "When [CHN.GetLeader] brought you in, it was with the expectation that you conduct yourselves with some amount of self-respect. You are free to do what you want with the territories you've taken, but is this really your best course of action?"\n\n"Yaks making use of conquered land!"\n\n"You're...!" The changeling struggled to not spout out "insane" to describe a supposed equal to [CHN.GetLeader]. "This is how you make use of what you've conquered? I speak respectfully, for we are allies, but we expect at least a facade of order and civilisation from you, not ravaging every single town and city only to do nothing else. What will you do when you've finished looting?"\n\nSuffused with his pride, Kerr stomped his chest. "Let ponies back, rebuild. Yaks ride here again. This very good and productive.""

Seven tall seats, each sat with a guest of renown and prestige in their own right, and each with a servant behind them to tend to their every need personally, while the highest seat in all the land hosted them for a feast that history would never forget. Star Mountain, Empress of Equus itself, stood and raised a glass, her eyes shot through with a spark of mania that could burn entire nations down, "I'd like to propose a toast to you all."\n\nHer eyes gazed around the room like a tank commander to their next target, "Let's begin with you, Sinister and Vasily," the cracked skull of the long dead socialists stared back at her with silent stares, "without whom the false usurpation of Severyana could never have borne fruit or put up so much of a fight for its ill-gotten gains!"\n\nThe servants around the room didn't dare interrupt, or even so much as break their stares with the wall opposite them as Star Mountain swung her gaze to the large skull of the old Khan Kerr, a prominent hole between the two empty eye sockets. "But I couldn't have even avenged my family or homeland if it wasn't for you paving the way for me! You cleared that commie Rutherford off the throne just to set it up for me, how thoughtful!"\n\nHer eye twitched as she locked glances with the nearly broken remains of Golden Delicious or Queen Helvia's skulls, each possessing only one hollow socket to look back at their conqueror. "But I'm afraid that's where the thanks end. YOU!" The mood in the room shifted, as though being tossed down the deepest, darkest chasm on the continent, but still, the servants focused solely on making it out alive to tell the tale. "YOU weren't satisfied with infesting your countries with the virus of socialism, so you had to lead a resistance against a more pure, more perfect Equus."\n\nA giggle escaped from Star Mountain's lips, and it broke the dam containing her wrathful glee, as she burst into a laughing fit, nearly dropping her glass on the ground. "But I beat you all! You tried everything you could at every turn and I still won! You were all just stepping stones to bring me to my highest point, and I thank you all for your sacrifices. Equus thanks you! Oh, but where are my manners? Servants, if you would."\n\nAs rigidly as a soldier, each staff member stepped forward, placing down and uncovering a tray of the most gourmet food the nation could offer."

newjaks.65.d:0 "Beds and cots grumbled; blades and bullets stayed sheathed at home; a slothful protest ran through the freezing snow and tundra. Stern letters and quiet speeches culminated into a clear image the khan couldn't ignore in one of his rounds along the settlements. Or maybe that was the image: that they insisted on settlements. Bradford had flooded the Jakichikh with a selfish poison that drove them to boarding up their windows and cities against the outside world. They'd loved the slumber...\n\nSmothering them in their sleep wasn't a luxury. A fine line existed between heroic khan and traitorous dictator. To oust them into the icy conditions outside as they were would breed resentment. They had to see that they'd be spending a lifetime in a filth of nothingness if they never turn to action.\n\nSo here was a chance at a greater freedom: the opportunity to become the Middle Clan, to sit at Kerr's right hoof as an entire people. For them, it was time for the khan to pay up; for the horde as a whole, it was an invitation to partake in the trampling of the unknown. Only glory could be found there.\n\nAnd it was glory they sought once he summoned the right clan leaders into his presence."

Over the lantern-lit table, orders were given and taken to craft new fronts, imagine new scenarios of glorious victory. The wise yaks collected here wouldn't sit here under the shelter of a roof while the blizzard and the battle rages in the field and over the peaks, for they were swaddled in gear and armour, enough bullets and sharp objects to single-hoofedly slice through a battalion like melted ice.\n\nAt the head of the latest shouting match stood Kerr. "Another offensive at the ready! More yak soldiers and troops here and there! No more idle troopers! See all yaks deployed here! Plenty chances at good work and fight for everyday yak!" Cheers and salutes by the sword led him to the wintry elements outside of the steamy and sweaty yurt. Nearby, a river ran wild; beyond, a short gallop to another neighbouring government to pacify.\n\nThat sent every yak of significance into a frenzy, a frenzy of Kerr's choice. The time and energy they've slavishly thrown to the next war to wage could've been spent scheming on useless politics that could nevertheless lead to Kerr's own demise in a sea of envy and rumours. No, another war would come to occupy them. The especially disloyal rascals could obtain the honour to serve the khan on the squads that'd go front and centre, as meat for the enemies to drive through: enough materiel for a feint, to deceive and entrap the opposing force. The great horde wasn't perfect—they'd have casualties eventually—but the losses they'd suffer could be chosen...\n\nHe wouldn't have to make anything up.

Given that they possess much of what used to be northern Equestria, this has alienated much of the pony population. In the yaks' wake, opportunities for Equestrian collaboration and co-operation are quickly becoming dust.\n\nYet, the reports have only grown more graphic: the Black Horde has utilised the full might of their martial arsenal to loot helpless and useful civilians. One could argue that these nation-wide raids cripple whatever resistance is left among the ponies, but a counter-argument could be made that it has only fostered resentment.\n\nAt least for those under our control, the ponies have the option to join us and rebuild. The same can't be said for the khan's cronies, from whom not even the safety of defeat can shield a family that had done no wrong.\n\nNo doubt, the khan's strength may still be of use, but he and his crew have to be corralled.

Each crease of their chitin, each hoofstep and wing-flap, he'd engrave in his long record of those too slight for their slackness against harmony. He wouldn't give them the satisfaction of a bow, of treating [CHN.GetLeader] as anywhere near his level, not after the whole shtick of kicking the Horde out for their "savagery".\n\nA final morsel of hospitality, they'd have: Kerr himself accompanying the changeling attaché back home. Traversing these paths transformed into a reversal of the welcome he'd given them so long ago, of praising them as fellow creatures that recognised the weak yet infectious beliefs of the ponies in their insulated communities.\n\nA grey sunset graced them when they reached the border; guns and uniforms on both sides had been put on high alert, expecting any incident. Once the last limb of changeling presence in [JAK.GetAdjectiveCap] territory left, infectious laughter overcame Kerr, enough for him to clench his barrel beneath all of his armour—enough that the crags and peaks that accompanied him in his trip back home quaked in his glee."

The Black Horde could fight for that, a legacy to protect and proclaim over every other. A what-could've-been manifested: the pride of a yak, the standing reserve of their combined energies to forge a paradise from one yak to another, where all rivals would be erased, afterthoughts.\n\nThe snowy air cried in one gust, threatening his yurt. A message, perhaps—that of cosmic forces. Shorooniism had to be uprooted to give way to the forgotten gods that mattered. Where are the deities whose domains were machinery and technology? Who detested the old and would empower the new? Devotion to recreate what was lost and to embody an industrial and aggressive spirit, a continent of endless praise under a black banner.\n\nBut the gods, too, faced greater forces. They experienced time and its embedded cycles and patterns—that could still be yanked into any aspirant's control. This world had been embroiled in seismic change, sliding down towards guns and glory. A fiery end would consume them, but by whose spark? The yaks'. They could become the inevitable scourge, the victor of a never-ending series of conflicts because one must always win.

Even then, she wasn't too afraid as she passed by two elite yak guards and through the even larger stone doors which held Star Mountain.\n\nThere were two outcomes on Yakkenkova's mind as she marched towards the towering mare leering down at her: Either she would be praised, or she would be condemned. Neither of which she regretted. The room was bright with the afternoon sun, with the faint scents of the city below floating in through the window. Sunlight and aromas seemed to be the only thing adorning the room, aside from a few more guards, a throne, and the leader of the Khaganate herself, everything else was empty.\n\nIt made Star Mountain rising from her seat all the more foreboding, pressing down on Yakkenkova as though she had her own force of gravity. "Do you know why I called you here?" Her voice rumbled like gravel falling down a bottomless pit, her eyes intense, yet hiding their intentions.\n\nInstantly, Yakkenkova knelt before her, half from instinct and half from intimidation. "No, my Khatun."\n\n"Rise, and I shall tell you." As she picked her head up, she was stunned to see Star Mountain's beaming face, "I've heard of your exploits with the griffon settlers to the east, and I must say that your actions are illegal." She let her words hang in the air before adding in a wink, "And exactly the kind of boldness I'm looking for! If only my generals had the spine that you do!"\n\nYakkenkova's surprise multiplied, and then all at once exploded into joy. "Thank you, my Khatun! I liken my struggle to yours against the socialists who took everything from you, see, they took everything from ME too!"

Many obedient drones—good slaves—danced around in circles for their queen, a queen that lacked the space in her head to understand the wisdom of taking Equestria for what it was: boundless chaos to be pacified. Who was Chrysalis to let harmony fester and encroach upon the work she and the yaks had created? What use would the ponies be, keeping them around to chase after some false hope of buying freedom? That often entailed bureaucracy, an occupation fit only for busybodies. There was no glory there.\n\nOnly in the spoils.

The glasses and respirators sinisterly rendered them faceless monsters whose presence made the otherwise boxy and comedic-looking "chemical weapons" they held a thing to not be negotiated with. The result was that no changeling wanted to see a test run of these.\n\nYngvar ignored the onlookers relegated to the sidewalk, leading his parade through the gates of an expansive park where wide open concrete fields must've held demonstrations of the Chrysalian army once upon a time. A small crowd of morbidly curious changeling watchers had followed, unable to wrench away from the sight of changeling officers lined up in a neat little row. The yaks had cleaned their uniforms, got them shiny and pristine—present these leaders as the best of the best that still fell short when the horde knocked on their door.\n\nThey were supposed to be warriors, born and bred to command and conquer. Chrysalis and her lackeys had said so some time ago. This hour, the audience wondered if they should've joined the battle; at least they could've died in noble sacrifice.

Amid spoils (candy for the eye) and feasts (symphonies of smell), the clans had survived and thrived by paying fealty to the almighty khan. But gossip flourished: Equus was finished, and it'd either be theirs to share, or be Kerr's to rule without equal. The khan could so easily claim the latter in the name of weeding out the greed and temptation—he'd dragged Yakyakistan out of the muck, so no one else could compete.\n\nThe khan soon trotted in, majestic in his royal armour, thunderous in each of his hoof-thuds. Upon taking the high seat, he raised a hoof. "Kerr consider ruling no more. No more place to conquer. Only here." Surprise etched themselves in everyone else's faces, including Thyra's, who was deliberating on who'd be next—"This greatest extent of yaks for now. Entire continent here. Rest of world can wait. Yaks now consolidate and enjoy peace and victory. For choosing next khan, no more khan. Kerr is one yak; all yaks are many. Yaks must have proper Khuraltai... with idea from Thyra."\n\nShe perked up, wondering whatever her suggestion had been that Kerr took an interest in it. "What idea?""

newjaks.74.d:0 "In an act of great humility, Kerr has stepped down from leadership. His belief is that [JAK.GetNameDef] ought to be led by its most capable leader via elections and a presidency. However, it was Kerr that led yaks to the pinnacle of achievement, so with enough pressure from close confidants, he is now running for the yaks' first elections in their history. His forceful personality, with charisma backed by a thousand weapons, he'll be a strong contender in the arena of politics, and it won't be a surprise to have him return and add President to his list of titles.\n\nYet, he has to run against someone, and so two candidates have been allowed. The first option is Yngvar, an oddball precisely because he is still a communist, yet that may end up working in his favour. He's been a favourite among the lower non-soldier classes—the Black Horde hasn't been built on just warriors but also on so many factory workers, spurred on by the draconian measures that would brutalise them and strip them of their dignity. No more to this, Yngvar has said—there is no more war to excuse their mistreatment. His presidency is for the common yak, for every yak has the right to be free.\n\nMeanwhile, Kerr's wife, Yakkenkova, can be seen as the second phase of war: the only enemies left are those enslaved and given the grace to not die under a yak banner—yet. In truth, the horde has not stopped fighting, only its foes are within their borders, and they have left so much behind that can be taken from and destroyed. Yakkenkova will stop at nothing until Yakyakistan's revenge is sated, starting with the griffons that wronged her and her lineage so long ago.\n\nOn cheap paper scribbled with runny ink, votes will be written and cast, inscribing into destiny who will uphold this land for a long, prosperous era."

newjaks.75.d:0 "Yaks had once wandered off to the coast, to the edges of the earth, perhaps some ways off on a ship that bobbed over the eternal sea. They had also once journeyed to lonely pockets of land, fresh from the conquest of creatures foolishly defiant (a cave, a base, a lonely cloud commandeered by defiant pegasi). Lists of ratted-out names narrowed down the search of malignant agents until they were whittled down into nothing. The maps were coloured in, the battle-lines shortened. The final victory was not a valiant invasion against an equal foe: it was the forgetful vanishing of what wasn't Kerr's.\n\nWhen the last operation was done and there was no need for a meeting of the generals in the near future, it struck Kerr as an ignoble end. The void in his schedule annoyed him more than the fact every one of his enemies had died.\n\nThe hordes and khans of previous times had fallen short. Kerr, too, could fail if he were to flounder in a bid for Griffonia or Zebrica. Still, this... this was enough. Equus was a world of its own, and an expansive one at that. A universal dominion was his, and what a fortress he'd made out of it. Past khans had boasted of such a union; Kerr had the evidence, could prove that such a union was of his own making. He'd be a hero to surpass all heroes.\n\nA hero that didn't know how to lead. To lead a horde that had outgrown him to become what it was destined to be.\n\nA council must be called."

With our most powerful supporter in the yak lands now long gone, it is for the best, and it seems like Lucinidea is more than glad to return home to her fellow kin.\n\nBut just as she hasn't forgotten her career before we shipped her out, we haven't forgotten that she used to be part of the Heer. She has indeed cultivated her sense of strategy over there, but we must accept that she is not exactly the best of the best. A tamer option, of course, is to let her resume her time in the Heer from where she left off: an administrative official."

newjaks.77.t:0 "An Empire of Dust"
newjaks.77.d:0 "It wasn't fair. Weeks ago Star Mountain had climbed to the highest point in her life, and perhaps in the history of the continent she ruled over, through blood and struggle, and now it was all coming down around her. Since Yakyakistan, her life had been a slow and grinding climb upward, never once made to take a step back, but with every report of a supply caravan being ambushed, a night raid being conducted on an army base or city garrison, or bombing of rails or trade ships, she was forced to do so.\n\nThe Empress of all Equus hated the taste of defeat on her tongue, and hated that it only grew more bitter as the days went on. The east of Equestria was succumbing to that old hardline communist Masha Norushkina, the Heartlands were falling to Night Glider who rallied just about everyone into a united front against their Empress, and most absurdly, the storybook character Daring Do had joined forces with one of her own advisaries, Ahuizotl to wreak havoc in the southeast! Everywhere in the Khaganate she looked, Star Mountain either saw fire or the smouldering smoke of where a fire raged.\n\n"It's ok, it's all going to be taken care of..." Star Mountain reassured herself, pacing back and forth across her throne room in Canterlot, trying and failing to convince herself. "We just need to swing the army to one threat at a time and let each of the dominoes fall. The north hasn't fallen, so we can utilze it as a rallying—"\n\nThe towering twin doors on the other side of the chamber burst open, and a messenger ran in with a look of exhaustion and terror written on his face. He all but collapsed before Star Mountain as he bowed to her, lifting his head and panting desperately, "My Empress, I've received terrible news."\n\n"Another communist terrorist I presume? Where?" The Khatun braced herself for another blow.\n\n"Worse, Your Majesty," The messenger gulped, himself bracing for the reaction, "The Windigos have returned, and the entirety of Northern Equus is being ravaged by them. Entire cities have had no choice but to evacuate. The army has retreated as well."\n\nStar Mountain closed her eyes, as though the words themselves struck her, and dismissed the messenger. Once the doors shut behind him, the Empress of all Equus sunk to the ground and quietly sobbing, only for the dam to burst and hurl forth a tidal wave of wails and tears."

newjaks.78.d:0 "A letter hailed from Chrysalis, and it was a bold request: to merge the governments of the bears' fellow ice-souls within the southern yaks and to be a singular confederation of the north.\n\nThis soon proved to be a dilemma for Bjornling. In the latent spiritual exchange of ideas that lesser minds called "politics", debates had sprung on the nature of yaks. What were they? Could they, as Chrysalis worded it in quotation marks, truly be kindred spirits, embedded in ice and winter together? Bjornling had touted it to be so. However, it was not secret that we bears—at least those of us under Volsungr—had ruled over mighty parcels of rugged lands where yaks knew their place, free to do as they pleased yet ultimately subservient to those who perfectly embodied the cold. Given the war the yaks recently had with themselves, the southron disease of harmony and passivity might not have left them fully just yet.\n\nTherein lay the problem: Was it really time for Bjornling to be on the same level as someone like Khan Kerr, and so forcefully? Or could this be a fatal error from Chrysalis, whose plan would doom the future unity of every winter beast?"

He had no pretensions about letting them run free: whatever insane ideas this Bjornling khan of theirs had, even the mighty bears would be subjugated. Kerr's predecessors had once dreamed of turning the barren ice into paradise, after all...\n\nBut for now, he and Bjornling were both subjects to Chrysalis. To contest her decision when she was armed to the teeth with enough munitions to burn their world would be madness, although after submitting to an overlord one too many times, would a khan even remain a khan, or would that just be the hollow shell of a once-great warrior?"

newjaks.80.d:0 ""Peace deal?"\n\nThe bird's feathers ruffled as he spat out the words, and hissed them as if they were an insult to his very honour. His well pressed uniform started to get rather unkempt from his protestation, and he flapped the letter in the air.\n\n"Peace deal!?" he repeated.\n\nThe other officers, resting on the other side of his desk, sat at statue-still attention. They had delivered the missive only minutes ago, and the colonel before them had been outraged since he had read it.\n\n"This isn't a peace deal, this is a gods damned... this is nothing more than coercion! Racketeering!"\n\nHis wings rustled again, and he released a long and drawn out sigh. "You realize I'm duty-bound to report this up the chain. This... I can't let them read this. This reads like a poorly worded extortion letter."\n\nThe colonel fell back into his seat, and tossed his cap on the desk. "After all they've done to us, all the barbarity- and they have the audacity to ask for peace," he hissed bitterly, and reached out for his quill. "Naturally, of course, demanding the land they took. Animals."\n\n"Call your fastest courier," he ordered, and slid the letter across. "Send this to the general staff." he added, and glowered at the paper on the desk. "They'll have my recommendation shortly."\n\nIt was not going to be a very positive one, and as the officers filed out of the room they remained full of anxiety. It was one thing to have cold relations, it was altogether another to smell blood in the air."

newjaks.81.t:0 "The Griffons Refuse!"
newjaks.81.d:0 ""Refusal?""\n\nBradford's fur bristled as he spat out the words, and growled them out as if they were an insult to his very heritage. One could even swear that steam was billowing out of his nostrils, although that may well have simply been the cold flowing in from outside.\n\n"Refusal." Bradford repeated, his voice lower and colder as he accepted the implications.\n\nBradford's head turned up, and he gazed upon the courier that had delivered the letter. His eyes narrowed, and his body tensed. He had learned, in leadership, to temper his anger- enough to grow it into a tempest that could sweep away mountains.\n\n"You can't refuse me what I already have," Bradford declared. "We will crush them with a tornado of hooves. A thousand- a million yaks! We will bury them with metal and strength!"\n\nBradford's voice raised to a thunder, and he commanded the same authority with his bold words that had given him such a respect by his people.\n\n"The birds have yet to see real war, but they will!"\n\nWhen the courier left to deliver the orders, it was the start of that tempest. War had already begun, but the escalating fire in Bradford's eyes was beyond conquest and land. Bradford could imagine for a moment, and stew in his quarters, the preparations the griffons were undoubtedly making. Preparations and defenses that would be swept away by yaks, by him. The Jaki-Clan, and Yakyakistan, needed that land. If he was to lead, he had to give it to them.\n\nThere was no other way."

newjaks.82.t:0 "Yak Elders and Leaders Arrive!"
newjaks.82.d:0 "It was a cold and dreary day in the village of Tuma, and the hundred-odd ponies that inhabited it were contesting against the bitter depression of a cold winter with good company and a good amount of the winter's supply of cider. Lights in the town lit it like an oasis of warmth in the ocean of cold around it, and yaks had been drawn to it from a great distance. They had walked, and walked, and walked. They had fought cold and hunger, and finally that town was close enough that they could smell the stews of a dozen families in the air.\n\nWhen the yaks arrived, they were met at first by a baffled and rather inebriated border guard. His checkpoint had always been more of an obligation- they had to have some sort of marking on the border, but never a serious defense. Indeed, the border post was little more than a single wooden hut with a wood fired stove for warmth inside.\n\nSo the yaks had 'invaded', ignoring the outpost as they stepped past into Stalliongrad itself. The sounds of their steps, and the murmuring of their group, had drawn out the townsfolk.\n\nIt was the head of the town party that realized the truth- even as he stumbled out of his home with rosy red cheeks and a bottle of something in hoof. These were their ideological brothers in the yak nation, expelled for their beliefs. Thrown out, as Equestria had with them, for their audacity to dream of a better world.\n\nThe yaks had never received such a greeting as they did that night, as every home opened itself to be a host, and every yak was treated as if they were family. They were, in a way, after all- family in ideology.\n\nIn Yakyakistan they were outcasts, and now they were exiles. In Stalliongrad however, now they were comrades. Their days of ideological speeches and rousing of labour were done, but there was a peace in accepting a fair place in a new home that comforted them. They were safe here, accepted, wanted.\n\nThe cider was quite good as well."

However, a letter was sent to Canterlot just a few days ago, unexpectedly suggesting that Equestria and Yakyakistan work together to "SMASH Chrysalis". According to his own words, while yaks do not like Equestria's soft and un-yakish beliefs, they find having Equestrians as neighbors far more preferable to being "enslaved by evil bug queen". Some say it is simply a geopolitical pragmatism, while others believe that the exiled Rutherford played a role in changing Bradford's mind."

newjaks.87.t:0 "The Grandest Shamanic Ritual in History"
newjaks.87.d:0 ""Every. Shaman."\n\nBradford repeated the two words, and let his glare fall upon the senior officers sharing the room with him. They had balked, at first, at his grand demands to have the entire army blessed- but his words were not dreams. He fully expected them to be realized, and he demonstrated his command by stomping the floor and releasing a cloud of hot air in a growling snort.\n\nThe officers nodded, their acceptance clear even if the logistical nightmare of this idea clearly horrified them. All the same, the filed out respectfully. Only then did Bradford release his tension. It was going to take more than his own ambition to achieve victory.\n\nIt was going to take miracles.\n\nSomehow, impossibly, it only took three weeks. Three weeks to organize every shaman in the land; by bayonet point, bribed, or in the most thankful cases ideological rhetoric, and organize them all in one place. There they stood, in their hundreds, surrounding an enormous fire that cast their shadows across the snow-covered  valley. In the darkness, the largest army that Bradford could have mustered stood. Every yak not fighting or required to serve the front had been assembled.\n\nThe ceremony itself was beautiful, but had an ominous feeling to it. Bradford knew now that if he failed, it would appear the very ancestors had cursed him. The stakes were raised."

We stomp them out like embers of dying fire! Rout, smash, not just for us yaks, but for all creatures! All see our glory and write songs!"\n\nBradford had never had a taste for the supremacists. Some perhaps thought this was ironic, given how conservative and traditionalist his group was- but they were no murderers. Bradford had no problem with other races, he only asked that if they were on his land, that they respect his traditions. Yaks were not superior by blood, they had no divine right to rule the world- they were simply stewards of their own kingdom. Supremacists though, they held their chins high with arrogance and butchered those they viewed as impure.\n\nThe Yaks would stand for the 'impure'.

The huffs of a pair of yaks behind her, those who had sold her out for their own fur, pushed her to continue the march onwards. They would not be granted the gift of her submission, even now.\n\nStar's ears flicked as she heard the chambering of rifles from the platform ahead. As she ascended the stairs, she was met with a line of yaks fumbling with their rusty breech-loaders. New recruits, clearly those with sense had died alongside Cinnamon in their last stand a few days...no, weeks ago. Her time behind bars had let her mind lose track of the dates. If only Cinnamon was somewhere higher, where her voice could have reached more yaks...\n\nThe shove of one of the guards escorting her brought Star from her pondering. Growling like a cornered wolf, she continued until a pair of stomps against the cold metal floor signaled for her to stop.\n\nNo crowd, bar those who had been pressed into firing on her. If she'd taken that course, she could have easily escaped, but alas. One of the guards walked up to Star, holding a piece of cloth to act as a blindfold. A final mercy from one traitor to another, the empty space on his medal bar mocking her of the chance Kerr had once thrown away, a chance to improve their army's strength and her own power to take his role...\n\nThe grunt of the guard brought her from her worries once more, the bellowing voice of another brought her attention to the rifles shakily staring her down, their clicks echoing in her mind. At last, as the final checks were made, Star spoke for the first time in weeks, the great speech her mind had concocted brought low by her hoarse, croaking voice.\n\n"I may die, but my anger will haunt you." "READY!" "You, who think yourself innocent. You, who willingly serve that blasted communist Kerr. You, who bring horror and disgust to another vile land in your sick twisted games of power." "AIM!" "My death is temporary, a respite from this biting agony before I return to reclaim my birthright."\n\nTime seemed to slow.

This meant that only one option remained - the royal smashing grounds, a place of joy, freedom and simplicity in both their minds.\n\nHowever, the meeting itself could hardly be called easy. Two yaks stood opposite each other in eerie silence, far removed from the usual sounds of warrior cries and destroyed wood. With the honorary guard instructed to ensure their privacy, no one else could see them. Still, even without outside attention, they were not free to embrace this moment, as anger, doubts and pain all lingered, flaring up with cruel intensity.\n\nBreaking the hold of emotions for a moment, Bradford shuffled closer and Rutherford hesitantly mirrored him. Brothers covered the tiny distance separating them slowly, excruciatingly so, stopping frequently, yet finally reaching the middle point.

The one standing in front bowed, making the jewelry adorning his horns ring softly. "With tidings of snow, from above and below, we bring word."\n\n"What Maihov want?" The traditional answer the messenger expected was known to Bradford well, but he was not the most patient creature even in the calmer days.\n\n"Honorable elder Maihov express disapproval." A scoff from the decorated yak stuck in his throat as the prince who easily towered over him took a threatening step forward. "Yak way is to keep to eternal peaks, he say. Not rush south like..."\n\n"Like Rutherford." Frowning, Bradford ended the sentence himself. This comparison used to be a great insult, but now a certain part of him welcomed it. "War will not stop. Yak way is to smash from end to end."\n\n"Honorable elder Maihov understand. But he have plans and conditions when war over." With another jingle, Jaki representative produced a leather scroll and timidly passed it to the prince.\n\nAfter breaking the seal, he quickly glanced over the hoof-written demands: his named brother sought a return to a confederation of clans, bound to their mountains by bickering and infighting. Perhaps, a compromise could be reached - no, that was a pony manner of solving problems, and Bradford took a second to push the thought away."

Few of them expected to be back, yet here they were again, with even greater commotion.\n\nWhen the first of dozens of fully packed coaches opened, only two creatures came out, a pony with an unkempt green mane and a yak with hastily braided hair. Both of them looked weary, mangy, with worn-out clothes and gaunt faces, but they walked side by side with a rare confidence\n\n"Yona." The leader of the welcoming committee bellowed the name coldly. "Yak bring unexpected guests."\n\n"Prince Bradford." Meeting his gaze, she instinctively moved to cover her companion. "Yona humbly ask permission to stay. For all in need."\n\nGlancing at the dirty windows of the carriage, Bradford could easily discern lots of smaller and bigger silhouettes. This was not the deal he had negotiated with the exiles - they were to return on their own, not to shove in a bunch of Equestrians with them.\n\n"Your Majesty, we plead for your clemency." The stallion leaned from behind Yona and bowed. "We will work for our place, and if you want ponies isolated away from yaks, we will oblige happily." Despite her best effort, Yona winced at the last words, but quickly got a hold of herself, repeating the reverent gesture.\n\nThey were smart to beg, Bradford thought. This idea of a walled-off labor camp would be acceptable for most conservatives, and by prostrating themselves so they gave him an option to begrudgingly accept the deal, but...\n\n"Rise." The prince swung his hoof dismissively. "All can stay as free creatures.""
newjaks.100.a:0 "He would not break more ties over politics."

newjaks.101.t:0 "The Canterlot Parade"
newjaks.101.d:0 "Looking over the assembled crowd, Bradford realized that he had never seen so many creatures in one place, especially ponies. The columns of his own warriors, however large they were individually, appeared like a thin layer of fresh snow over an equine mountain. Lots of different kinds of mares and stallions gathered to see their liberators and hear the prince talk, from soldiers of miraculously preserved regiments and hardy partisans to simple workers, students, elderly, or even little foals.\n\n"Bradford honored to come to Canterlot." He started to talk slowly, allowing loudspeakers to carry his address to the far corners of the square. "City might be smashed, but its heart beat on, people stand high, and yaks salute ponies." In response to the greeting a wave of cheering and applause arose, taking a minute or two to settle down.\n\n"Once, brother Rutherford promised Equestria friendship for thousand moons." The prince quickly casted an eye towards the sibling standing next to him, and continued after receiving a reassuring nod. "Since then, things turned difficult. They remain difficult. All had to learn struggle, all had to learn new obligations. Bradford learned that when eyes closed, great evil can remain unseen. No more. Yaks strong. Ponies strong. But yaks and ponies stronger together! On frontlines and at homes, all fight on until lands are safe again!"\n\nWhile this rallying cry was echoed by the multitude of inspired voices, Rutherford stepped closer. "Brother make brother proud. Horn bump!""
newjaks.101.a:0 "The offer was more than welcome."

newjaks.102.t:0 "Peace and Compromise"
newjaks.102.d:0 "The war was over at last. Under the command of prince Bradford, yak forces swept across Equus, not as conquerors, but as liberators. Still, this smashing march left a poignant question: what was to be done with the lands which became free once again? The powerful political clique of disgruntled isolationists argued that the current state of affairs was already one step too far, demanding that the war-torn territories were left to fend for themselves. Of course, the past Bradford would agree, but that prince would never rise to the point of making this choice.\n\nThe plan developed by him with the help of Rutherford, Yona and a committee of creatures representing different regions and races was much more involved. It included the separation of the continent into several restoration zones and launch of multiple welfare programs. Additionally, an overarching temporary yak administration was to be established, ensuring mutual cooperation and providing a peacekeeping force in the form of the partially demobilized and re-trained army.\n\nSuch a grandiose venture was destined to become polarizing, especially with the strain it put on the yak state. However, Bradford did not doubt the necessity of the charted effort, and the spirit of reforms was blossoming in him, revitalized in his brother and starting to be felt through the mountains and beyond."
newjaks.102.a:0 "Yet, there was another brother of his."

newjaks.103.t:0 "The Reactionary's Reaction"
newjaks.103.d:0 "Troubling news from Yakistown! While prince Bradford was on the diplomatic tour promoting the new continental system, an insurrectionist host commanded by Maihov, Jakichikh elder and the named brother of the ruling monarch, occupied the capital. He demands immediate retraction of the positive foreign policy, forcing the issue further by taking disagreeing members of Khuraltai hostage.\n\nEnraged with this development, Bradford rushes to the city with a handful of personal guards, seeking to convince those he can and disperse the more stubborn mutineers by force. Does he succeed?"
newjaks.103.a:0 "Prince falls into a well-prepared trap and is placed into house arrest."
newjaks.103.b:0 "Fortune favors the bold, and defeated Maihov is consigned to a personal fiefdom."

newjaks.104.t:0 "Future Remade" #translation suggestion - druzhba = crushba (Fabian)
newjaks.104.d:0 ""Funny." Bradford snorted loudly, surprising his companions.\n\n"What brother mean?" Despite all the time they spent together since their reunion, Rutherford was only starting to understand the new, softer side of his sibling. Yona simply gave Bradford a puzzled look, a bit wary of his good mood and still not quite used to this casual talk from her elders.\n\n"Once, Rutherford said Yona should go to Equestria, and Bradford said Yona should not go. Now, everything reversed."\n\n"Yona is up to task." Speaking with determination, she raised her head slightly. "Yona learned much from best teachers, back there and here too."\n\n"Much difference between school going and country ruling." After a pensive shrug, Rutherford hurried to complete his thought. "But both yaks right. Rutherford just worried."\n\n"Princes will be there to help. Always." Bradford returned to a serious tone if only for a moment. "And yaks good rebuilders. Yaks have lots of valuable experience to share. What is that pony phrase again?"\n\n"Friendship is magic?" Yona's answer was completely innocuous, but another grin appeared on Bradford's face as soon as she finished.\n\n"Time for little smash-gic. Yaks get it?" The royal study was quickly filled with guffawing and sighs in equal measure. It seemed that awful puns were on their way to become the biggest threat for the creatures of Equus."

JAK_the_queen_of_the_bugs_desc:0 "With the changelings defeated, we are now at a crossroads on how to govern this vast land. The methods used in Severyana are likely not to be productive here, as changelings are naturally very skilled partisans. Moreover, communism has not yet fully sunk its vile tendrils into Changeling culture. Therefore, rather than decimation, we will show mercy.

Noted for her cruelty and harshness against her serfs forced to labor in the salt mines, and for her near-monopoly on salt production in Severyana, her large, ancient dynasty was nearly completely toppled in the Winter Revolution. Many of her relatives faced decades in prison, while others were shot for their exploitation of the poor. She and her husband tried to fly to Trottingham, but her husband was shot down and drowned in the Celestial Sea. She only barely escaped.\n\nNow, she has joined Star Mountain's rightful crusade against the communists.

He has always been interested in magical beasts, and the influence of stars on them as well. He is determined to discover the truth behind these mysteries, no matter the cost.

They often contain ideas that go against the yak Way of Life, and as such censorship is required. A strange creature offered to help Jaki-Clan with their task of cleaning up texts from abroad: Abram the goat. He offered to simply eat all paper which contained offensive or misguided text. The yaks, lacking the technology of paper shredders, happily accepted Abram's offer. It is a symbiotic relationship: Abram gets to eat all the paper he wants, while the Jaki-Clan gets to control what its subjects read.

Having saved Equestria and even welcomed Yona home, he's become unrecognizable to the yak he once was. No one would have believed it if they hadn't seen it themselves.

Disease struck Seva the next year, and the primitive yak medicine was unable to save him.\n\nWhen the Jakichikh seceded, Star Mountain sided with them, but not out of ideological reasons. She knows that harmony is necessary to keep different classes and races at peace, and that was sorely lacking in both Stalliongrad and Yakyakistan, but she knew her only shot at justice for her family was to bide her time. When Kerr overthrew Bradford, she took her chance. Now that all threats to her rule are out of the way, the new Khatun of Yakyakistan, reincarnation of the great founder Prince Ulysses, stands ready to bring her vision of harmony and order to all the countries of North Equus.

While some might consider him a traitor to the cause, he has never let it die in his heart. Now he plans to implement pro-worker reforms while maintaining the constitutional structure of Yakyakistan. Enough blood has been spilled already--there's no need for a civil war on top of everything else.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: BunnyShrubby"

She has one goal, one mission, one purpose: annihilation of those who sought to destroy the yak people!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Veri"

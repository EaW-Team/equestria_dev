### CHARACTERS ###

HAY_queen_bamina:0 "Queen Bamina"

### NATIONAL FOCUSES ###

HAY_the_federation:0 "The Federation"
HAY_the_federation_desc:0 "The Hayzeb federation is a new state, but it has deep roots within Hayzeb traditions and customs. With the slaves liberated and the city-states united under a single queen, the federation can be realized."

HAY_the_queen:0 "And Its Queen"
HAY_the_queen_desc:0 "Queen Bamina has united our people for the first time in our history, throwing off Mazwi overlords, Yeti raiders and the tyranny of our own slaver class. The commonzebra loudly praise her, the dispossessed slavers secretly curse her, but there is little doubt that she is the keystone of our federation."

HAY_the_lost_cities:0 "The Lost Cities"
HAY_the_lost_cities_desc:0 "Even in this moment of optimism, a stinging pain remains. Some Hayzeb cities, rather than being simply pillaged, were outright absorbed into the domains of the Storm King's warlords, and they still remain under their heel. While we are not yet strong enough to liberate our siblings, many clamour for vengeance against the Yeti tyrants."

HAY_persuade_local_magistrates:0 "Persuade Local Leaders"
HAY_persuade_local_magistrates_desc:0 "The Federation is a beautiful model of governance, but it is also frustrating. Local leaders are blocking efforts to centralise the army, and unlike a Mazwi emperor, the Queen cannot simply have their heads. We must persuade them to focus on the bigger picture."

HAY_appeal_to_commoners:0 "Appeal To The Commonfolk"
HAY_appeal_to_commoners_desc:0 "The demands of the local magistrates are unreasonable and bordering on corruption. Their loyalty is highly suspect. We may not be able to remove them directly, but the commonfolk are on our side. They will pressure their leaders to either get on board with the Queen's plan, or step down in favour of somezebra who will."

HAY_quid_pro_quo:0 "Quid Pro Quo"
HAY_quid_pro_quo_desc:0 "The demands of the local magistrates may be unreasonable, they may be bordering on corruption, but they are who we have to deal with. We will get what we want through negotiation, or not at all."

HAY_tour_the_federation:0 "Tour the Federation"
HAY_tour_the_federation_desc:0 "Bamina is the first Queen of all Hayzeb, and it behooves her to see her subjects and learn of their lives. The Grand Vizier has planned a tour of the cities and otwns of the Federation for her and her half-sister Zaria."

HAY_tour_the_capital:0 "Tour the Capital"
HAY_tour_the_capital_desc:0 "The Queen may hold many of them in contempt, but it is best for the aristocracy to be on our side when possible. The Grand Vizier has prepared a tour of the capital for Queen Bamina to meet these potentates and assuage their fears, although she may have other ideas in mind..."

HAY_lead_by_example:0 "Lead By Example"
HAY_lead_by_example_desc:0 "Queen Bamina has always preferred to lead from the front and mingle with her followers rather than staying  in the palace. Now that the federation is more or less secure, she can return to training the soldiers."

HAY_sacred_vow:0 "Our Sacred Vow"
HAY_sacred_vow_desc:0 "Queen Bamina made a sacred vow during her rebellion to liberate every slave in the Great Lakes. She will now publicly reaffirm that vow before the great and the small of the federation, and call upon them to march with her."

HAY_resharpen_your_weapons:0 "Resharpen Your Weapons"
HAY_resharpen_your_weapons_desc:0 ""Resharpen your weapons, Hayzeb. Freedom is not a bounty to be reaped, but an ideal to be fought for!"\n-Bamina, Queen of All Hayzeb"

HAY_muster_army:0 "Muster the Federal Army"
HAY_muster_army_desc:0 "The federal army is a motley assortment, but they are the most professional soldiers in our service. We must call them up, away from their individual districts and to the capital, in order to impose a common training regimen on them."

HAY_rally_rabble:0 "Rally the Rabble"
HAY_rally_rabble_desc:0 "Queen Bamina's personal army of freed slaves are fanatical and dedicated. They won the battles of the rebellion, although more through numbers and bloody-minded determination than through skill. In a perfect world they would be disbanded into the regular army, but until we have secured our borders they will form a vital part of our armies."

HAY_use_our_people:0 "Inspire Our People"
HAY_use_our_people_desc:0 "We will send our storytellers across the federation, rallying our people to take on their Queen's oath. Soon, Bamina's quest will become the quest of all Hayzeb."

HAY_use_their_people:0 "Inspire Their People"
HAY_use_their_people_desc:0 "We will send agitators and storytellers ahead of our army, promising to the slaves of the Great Lakes that liberation is coming. When our armies arrive at each new petty kingdom, these agitators will rally the downtrodden to help us in our advance."

HAY_march_of_the_chainbreaker:0 "March of the Chainbreaker"
HAY_march_of_the_chainbreaker_desc:0 "It is time to fulfil our oath. The Chainbreaker's march begins today, and it does not stop until the Great Lakes are liberated from slavery and tyranny."

HAY_fate_of_the_crown:0 "The Crown of Gelon-Zornu"
HAY_fate_of_the_crown_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Gelon-Zornu, the Zefuwa dynasty, and its crown have existed since time immemorial. There are many who believe that no matter how many times they are conquered, that dynasty will rise again. It is time we disabused them of that notion."

HAY_rehabilitate_minor_chiefs:0 "Rehabilitate Minor Nobles"
HAY_rehabilitate_minor_chiefs_desc:0 "Slavery was near-omnipresent as an institution in Gelon-Zornu, but we Hayzeb were not so innocent either. If we are to incorporate the Zornu thread into the weave of the federation, we must work with local leaders rather than exacting vengeance on them, even after casting down the largest and cruellest of the masters."

HAY_liberate_zornu_slaves:0 "Liberate the Slaves of Gelon-Zornu"
HAY_liberate_zornu_slaves_desc:0 "The slaves of Gelon-Zornu were freedzebras the instant we planted our banners. Still, many slaves do not know this, and still work for their old masters. We will send out our heralds and our soldiers to ensure none are still in bondage. Some will join our armies, others will remain in their villages, and still others will move to the cities to find work there, as free zebras."

HAY_integrate_zornu:0 "The District of Gelon-Zornu"
HAY_integrate_zornu_desc:0 "The ancient kingdom of Gelon-Zornu has been cast down and its subjects liberated. Only one thing remains before it can be integrated as a district of our federation. We must decide what to do with the lands of the former slaver-nobles, and how best to set up the freedzebras for a better life."

HAY_attack_ZUG:0 "The March Continues"
HAY_attack_ZUG_desc:0 "Ugabi: a land of half-measures, where the freedzebras are left destitute and the young are press-ganged into a ruthless army. Aoranda: a "republic" which beneath their prattle is simply another despotism, promising freedom tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow. Both reliant on vicious warlords to secure their power. Both shall be swept aside in the chainbreaker's march."

HAY_crushing_warlords:0 "Hunt Down the Warlords"
HAY_crushing_warlords_desc:0 "Both Ugabi and Aoranda were plagued by warlords, whether they wore the discipline of the UCTA or the brutality of the "Madmare of Aoranda." The remnants of their armies will be allowed to return home -if their former neighbours will have them- but the warlords, and any who refuse our offer, will be hunted down without mercy."

HAY_the_republican_idealist:0 "The Vanquished Republic"
HAY_the_republican_idealist_desc:0 "Now that the warlords have been driven out and the region brought to heel, will take stock of what is left of the failed Aorandan republican experiment. Perhaps there is something worth incorporating into our federation?"

HAY_absorb_gulu_remnants:0 "The Gulu Remnants"
HAY_absorb_gulu_remnants_desc:0 "We are not tyrants: we do not come to humiliate and plunder, but to unite. While the Gulu reformers of Ugabi may have been far too complacent to bring about true liberation, their ideals of tribal democracy could form an excellent basis for integrating the Ugabians into the federation."

HAY_experience_of_revolt:0 "The Experience of Revolt"
HAY_experience_of_revolt_desc:0 "The two glorious years of Bamina's revolt, fighting both the slavers and the roving Yeti warbands, provided us with a wealth of knowledge on strategy and logistics. We will send archivists to speak to the brave souls who fought in that rebellion, to compile their knowledge for future use."

HAY_warriors_of_liberation:0 "The Sword of Liberation"
HAY_warriors_of_liberation_desc:0 "Everyzebra in our armies must know that they fight for the liberation of their fellow creature, not for their subjugation. We will enter each new village carrying food and medicine for the local inhabitants, and any transgressions against them will be severely punished."

HAY_reformed_chain_of_command:0 "Rationalise the Chain of Command"
HAY_reformed_chain_of_command_desc:0 "Between the federal system and the ad hoc nature of Bamina's armed rabble, the Hayzeb chain of commmand is confusing and makes advanced tactics difficult to perform. We will simplify our chain of command so we can put our military knowledge into practice."

HAY_freedom_guns:0 "The Guns of Liberation"
HAY_freedom_guns_desc:0 "New innovations are trickling in from the wider world, and one has caught particular attention. The shrapnel shell promises to revolutionise warfare, for no longer will we have to fire directly with solid or canister shot. From now on our artillery will rain a hail of death upon the foe, wherever they hide!"


### DECISIONS ###

HAY_national_mood_cat:0 "The National Mood"
HAY_national_mood_cat_desc:0 "Bamina's government is popular among commoners, particularly freedzebras she liberated from slavery. However, it attracts suspicion from the aristocracy, particularly former slaveowners.\n\nHigher commoner §RZeal§! will increase the military effects of the §YZeal and Suspicion§! national spirit, while higher aristocratic §CSuspicion§! will increase its impact on your §Ystability§! and §Ypolitical power§!.\n\nThe mood of the commoners and the mood of the aristocracy affect one another. Having one high and the other low will naturally cause whichever is lower to steadily §Yincrease§!. Being at war will cause both to slowly trend up, while peace will cause both to slowly trend down.\n\nCurrently, the commoners are [HAY.GetCommonerMood], and [HAY.GetCommonerDrift].\nCurrently, the aristocracy are [HAY.GetNobleMood], and [HAY.GetNobleDrift].\n\nTemporary display for the sake of simple code:\nZealotry: [?HAY_NM_zealotry|%] - Drift: [?HAY_NM_Z_drift|%+]\nPlotting: [?HAY_NM_plotting|%] - Drift: [?HAY_NM_P_drift|%+]"

HAY_reassure_aristocrats:0 "Reassure the Aristocracy"
HAY_reassure_aristocrats_desc:0 "Queen Bamina will take a moment away from the troops to speak with landowners and former slaveowners, assuaging rumours that she is planning mass retribution on them."

HAY_rally_commoners:0 "Rally the Commoners"
HAY_rally_commoners_desc:0 "Queen Bamina will spend extra time mingling with the common zebras, letting the tales of her geniality and generosity spread as she does."

HAY_root_out_plotters:0 "Root Out Plotters"
HAY_root_out_plotters_desc:0 "The Grand Vizier warns of plots behind every corner, and asks only our leave in dealing with them. If circumstances become dire, we can use his network to root out our enemies."

HAY_discourage_fanatics:0 "Dissuade the Fanatics"
HAY_discourage_fanatics_desc:0 "The zeal of certain freedzebra is getting out of hoof. Bamina will meet with these fanatics personally and remind them that she is just a zebra, and that vengeance is not the way."

HAY_federal_cohesion_cat:0 "The State of the Federation"
HAY_federal_cohesion_cat_desc:0 "While each region has a §Ylocal governor§! acting as a point of contact, the §PHayzeb Queen§! rules through a complex weave of local authorities. These include village councils, tribal or clan leaders, merchant guilds, elected mayors, priests and wise-zebras, and so on; some loyal, some less so.\n\nHow efficient this complex system is varies, and is represented by a region's §Clocal cohesion§!. Low §CLocal Cohesion§! applies a penalty to §YRecruitable population§! and §YConstruction speed§!. The average of §Clocal cohesion§! between all regions forms the §Cfederal cohesion§!, which applies modifiers to §YStability§!, §Ypolitical power gain§!, and §Yconsumer goods factories§!."

### IDEAS ###

HAY_breaker_of_chains:0 "Broken Chains"
HAY_breaker_of_chains_desc:0 "In the aftermath of Mazwi's disintegration, Bamina rallied an army of slaves and with them united the lands of the Hayzeb. After becoming Queen, she liberated all slaves in the newborn nation and vowed to erase the oppressive institution from all of the Great Lakes, and perhaps even all of Zebrica. While the formerly enslaved masses rejoice, the former slaveowners are furious and many plot the downfall of the Queen."
HAY_city_states:0 "A Federation Of City-States"
HAY_city_states_desc:0 "Hayzeb has traditionally been divided into a number of city-states, which are centered around wealthy trade cities. The new Queen rallied the support of the cities by promising to grant them their historical rights which they had lost under Mazwian rule, but this has meant that the member states of the federation are very autonomous and pay little regard to the Queen and her central government."
HAY_inciting_rebellion:0 "Inciting Rebellion"
HAY_inciting_rebellion_desc:0 "We are stirring discontent among the slaves and the dispossessed of our future enemies. When we strike, they will strike with us, but we cannot fully control what these rebels will do."
HAY_rallying_people:0 "Rallying Our People"
HAY_rallying_people_desc:0 "we are rallying our people for the fight ahead, reiterating our message so that everyzebra knows they fight for freedom, whether on the battlefield or in the workshops."
HAY_fomenting_unrest:0 "Fomenting Unrest"
HAY_fomenting_unrest_desc:0 "We are appealing directly to our people against their intransigent local leaders. This is destabilizing the Federation, but will bring these magistrates to heel."
HAY_promises_to_magistrates:0 "Promises to Magistrates"
HAY_promises_to_magistrates_desc:0 "We are making promises and offering gifts to the intransigent magistrates in the federation. Their loyalty is questionable at bst, but with the right incentives they will fall in line."
HAY_national_mood_modifier:0 "The National Mood"
HAY_national_mood_modifier_desc:0 "While the freedzebras are enthusiastic to the point of zealotry about the current government, the aristocracy scheme against it."

### TOOLTIPS ###

HAY_natmood_decision:0 "We are already influencing the national mood"
HAY_inciting_rebellion_tt:0 "Will cause §Yenemies§! to suffer §Rriots and strikes§! upon the declaration of war."
HAY_unrest_tt:0 "Will increase our weekly §Rzealotry§! drift by §Y1%§!\nUpon removal, will increase §Ywar support§! by §Y10%§! and §Gfederal cohesion§! in [STATE] by §Y20%.§!"
HAY_promises_tt:0 "Will increase our weekly §Cplotting§! drift by §Y1%§!\nUpon removal, will increase §Ywar support§! by §Y10%§! and §Gfederal cohesion§! in [STATE] by §Y20%.§!"

HAY_NM_zealotry_add_5_tt:0 "This will increase our §Rzealotry§! by 5."
HAY_NM_zealotry_add_10_tt:0 "This will increase our §Rzealotry§! by 10."
HAY_NM_zealotry_subtract_5_tt:0 "This will reduce our §Rzealotry§! by 5."

### EVENTS ###

hayzeb.1.t:0 "The Federal System"
hayzeb.1.d:0 "Officially, the Hayzeb Federation was founded by Queen Bamina a mere six months ago when the Hayzeb city-states united for the first time following Mazwi's collapse. In reality, the Federation formalises the Hayzeb system of governance which predates the Mazwi.\n\nOur system is not a chain, like the Mazwi: an endless series of links forged by iron and oaths, binding slave to petty-master, petty-master to local chieftain, local chieftain to regional governor, and on and on to the Mansa in the capital. Nor is our system a sword, like the yetis: rule by direct force, the distribution of loot, the respect and fear of individual warlords for their conqueror-king. Our system is not forged in iron at all.\n\nOur system has always more closely resembled a basket. Lines of kinship, commerce, friendship and leadership woven together, intersecting across regional, tribal, and caste lines. Mutually supporting and interconnecting. This held true before the Mazwi, it held true under them, it held true when half of our city-states were Mazwi-ruled and half were not, and it holds true today.\n\nThe abolition of slavery, radical though it was, will purify this system. Between that and independence, we have removed the strands of iron which wore away at the wicker and fiber which made up the rest of the basket. Expansion will challenge this system. Adding new strands is never easy. But we will succeed, and bring all the Great Lakes into our weave."
hayzeb.1.a:0 "Long Live the Federation!"

hayzeb.2.t:0 "The Chainbreaker"
hayzeb.2.d:0 "Bamina looked out the window to the city below. Behind her, The Grand Vizier was sorting through petitions. "This one might interest you, your majesty," he said. Bamina didn't turn to face him, but that was normal, so he continued. "A mare has been sentenced to die by the laws of her tribe for killing the son of her former owner. This petition, which was signed by scores of members of her tribe, says she killed him a year ago while he tried to drag her back into slavery, and asks for a royal pardon."\n\n"Stay the execution," said Bamina, "But allow the tribal leaders to exile her to preserve the peace, if they must. Include a private letter to her with a small sum of money and an offer to work as a cleaner in the palace if she is exiled."\n\n"Very wise, your majesty."\n\n"I am as you made me," said the queen, and for a time it seemed she would remain silent for the rest of the afternoon. "How did we get here?" she finally asked, "How is this palace not rubble beneath our hooves? The Mazwi, the Storm King, me... so much devastation, and yet this palace still stands. Once it was not even really a royal palace. Once it was my father's house, and my cage. And now..."\n\n"Now you are the first Queen of all the Hayzeb, and he is dead," finished the Grand Vizier, "A footnote in the glorious story of your reign."\n\n"Glorious? Perhaps. Or perhaps it will be ruinous. Perhaps what began in blood will end in blood."\n\n"Blood is the way of the world, your majesty. You haven't stopped looking out that window. What do you see?"\n\n"I see my people, going about their business in the market square. Once in a while, one of them looks up to this palace. I wonder if they see me looking down at them. I wonder what they think.""
hayzeb.2.a:0 ""Your people put their faith in you, your majesty.""

hayzeb.3.t:0 "The Great Humiliation"
hayzeb.3.d:0 "Another refugee column crossed the border yesterday. They said the Yeti warlord Gyz Windborn had been forcing their relatives to fight as cannonfodder, and they fled to escape the same fate. Many arrived wounded or sick, with one dying from an infected wound inflicted by their pursuers mere hours after crossing our border.\n\nThese refugees are Hayzeb, one and all. They hail from the town of Zumbana, which alongside Munmane and Zpasu had been ocuppied since the Storm King's initial rampage. There are few cultural differences between them and us, but the difference in lifestyle is night and day. While we enjoy the fruits of freedom, they labour in chains far heavier than any the Mazwi put on us. While we sleep soundly, they stay up night after night praying that they will not be taken from their homes by the next press-gang.\n\nYesterday, the escapees crossed our borders. Today, the yetis make examples out of those who didn't make it. They stand there, mocking us, showing their other slaves what fate awaits runaways - and showing us what they will do to us once their own civil war is over. We lack the means to wage war on them directly: they have superior weapons, they are twice our size, and even if we defeat one warlord we would have to fight the other three while lowering our guard to the war looming in the Great Lakes. Still, several rural chieftains have arranged war parties with the intention of striking into their territory and liberating as many as possible. They ask only for their queen's blessing. Alternately, we can tell them to adopt a subtler approach, smuggling slaves out one-by-one and devoting our resources to aiding and resettling those who make it to our borders."
hayzeb.3.a:0 "Help as many make it out as we can."
hayzeb.3.b:0 "Prepare a raiding party."

hayzeb.4.t:0 "The Other Side of Federalism"
hayzeb.4.d:0 "Bamina stormed into her study, cursing under her breath. "Intransigent little fools!" she declared, "Do they not see? Tell me, old mentor, why am I alone in this fight?"\n\nThe Grand Vizier looked up from the letter he was writing. "Forgive me, your majesty. Is it the local leaders being difficult again, or is it something new?"\n\n"It's nothing new. Nothing at all!" Bamina quipped, flouncing onto a sort of throne made of pillows and rich carpets, "I simply don't understand how these creatures think. They are denying me the troops I need to launch our crusade, a crusade which will liberate the Great Lakes and make us strong enough to defeat whichever Yeti warlord becomes the next Storm King. Do they intend to have us wait until a second Storm King comes and massacres us all? Or are they hoping the slaving warlords beyond our borders will unite without a fight? Well, do you have any insight?"\n\nThe Grand Vizier chuckled. "Your majesty, you impute too much intelligence to them. They think short term, it is in their nature. I still disagree with your decision to leave the city-states and other local governments with their power. A unitary state would be far more capable of warmongering."\n\n"I don't want to warmonger, I want to liberate! Do you have any advice on how to do that?"\n\n"Alas, I was never taught how to liberate, so I couldn't teach you. We are in uncharted waters, Bamina. The way I see it, we'll have to think creatively to get the city-states to give us command of their armies. Appeal to their egoes, or at least to their fears. One way or another, you'll have to convince them. Unfortunately, it's the system you set up.""
hayzeb.4.a:0 "Governing isn't easy."

hayzeb.5.t:0 "The Soldier-Queen"
hayzeb.5.d:0 "The Grand Vizier was getting on in years, but his eyes were as sharp as ever. Sharp enough to peer through the new telescope he'd gotten shipped from Timbucktu, despite the glare of the noonday sun. On the other side of the glass, he could see her. Queen Bamina, working away at some ditch. She was showing a couple recruits how to dig, and the Grand Vizier chuckled at the sight.\n\n"What is she doing?" asked Zaria, behind him. Wordlessly, the Grand Vizier stepped back and motioned for the filly to look through the glass. After messing with it for a few seconds, Zaria finally managed to get the lens focused on her sister. "Why is she... digging? Did she find gold?"\n\n"No," the Grand Vizier chuckled at her childish innocence. "She's showing the recruits how to dig foxholes."\n\n"That's not very regal. Father always told me not to talk to common soldiery and not to get dirty. She's filthy! It's gotten all over her clothes!" Zaria started laughing, nudging the telescope and losing her sister entirely. "Oh horseapples!" she exclaimed.\n\n"Watch your manners, young one," the Grand Vizier cautioned her. "Your half-sister grew up poor, remember? When she was your age she dressed in rags. For her, this kind of work seems natural. And the soldiers love her for it. Of course, with our Queen always out there among the commoners, it falls to me to handle the court most of the time. She's a very different kind of ruler than her father. And when Bamina is gone, you will be whatever kind of ruler you wish to be, child. But for now, I'll try to educate you like I educated her.""
hayzeb.5.a:0 "Governing isn't easy, but neither is digging ditches..."

hayzeb.6.t:0 "The Sacred Vow"
hayzeb.6.d:0 "Zarki strained to see the Queen as she walked up onto the stage. What had once been an auction stage for all manner of chattel had become an amphitheatre, where plays were performed and speeches given. Zarki wouldn't have minded if there was at least an entry fee, but it was first-come, first-served. Wealthy zebras like Zarki could still get the best seats by having servants reserve them, but there were always others. At paid theatres, cheap seats would be taken by skilled craftzebras and traders. Creatures with some class and cleanliness. But here it was different.\n\nBeggars, ruffians, factory labourers still covered in grime. Prostitutes, teamsters, soot-smeared chimneysweeps, gaptoothed boardinghouse foals: the whole filth of society turning the place into a reeking open-air barn. And yet, this was where Zarki had to go today, to hear the Queen give her latest proclamation.\n\nShe began with her usual prattle, reminding everyzebra that freedom was a glorious thing, that struggle had united the Hayzeb and more struggle was coming in the future, and so on and so forth. Zarki thought back to her children, back in the country estate. They'd spent more time there as the capital city turned into a dump under The Chainbreaker's benevolence. Perhaps they should move there permanently...\n\nHer husband snapped her out of her thoughts as the Queen reached the climax of her announcement. "I made a vow, when we first embarked together on the journey of The Federation. I swore I would not rest until the chains of everyzebra in the Great Lakes were shattered. Now I look about me, and I see not just slavers, but tyrants and warlords! They will fight to the death to preserve their power. So I have gathered you here to this place, this site where once the vilest flesh-trade was conducted in broad daylight, and I ask you, Hayzeb people. Young and old, rich and poor, strong and weak: will you stand with me? Will you take on this vow as your own?""
hayzeb.6.a:0 "The freedzebras cheered, while the oppressors winced."

hayzeb.7.t:0 "Weapons New and Old"
hayzeb.7.d:0 "Kazu examined his new weapon in wonder. He knew the moment he picked it up that he would never go back to his old musket. Loading powder and bullet in a single metal cartridge, it meant goodbye to the old ramrod. He just had to work a simple lever, insert a round, and it was ready to fire. It had a clean sight built into it, adjustable for distance out to 1200 meters. Kazu had never shot out to 1200 meters, but with this thing he just might be able to. It was inlaid with brass and could fit a razor-sharp bayonet. He was just about to thank his sergeant for getting them a batch of the new rifles, when he heard his sergeant holler:\n\n"Ah yes, this is what they want us to fight with! Hah! This will win all our future wars. How optimistic our Queen is!" The sergeant was joined by raucus laughter as he slung his rifle and drew his Takoba. "Friends, don't listen to any of it. Rifles are fine, but in the end this is what carries the day!"\n\nHe swung the sword in a glittering arc, its double edges gleaming in the sun. "Finest Mazwi Steel, this!" the sergeant boasted, "I'd like to see one of those things lop off a yeti's arm. Practice your markszebraship, but never forget: the sword is king!""
hayzeb.7.a:0 "Bad advice spoken with infinite confidence."

hayzeb.8.t:0 "The Call to Arms"
hayzeb.8.d:0 "Maitama had met Bamina at the very beginning of her three year rebellion. She and her followers had stormed into Maitama's village, proclaiming that the Mazwi Empire had fallen and they were all free zebras now. The groundnut plantation where Maitama had slaved away on was to be divided among the newly-freed, as the masters had fled the rebels' advance. Maitama had joined her band, fighting and liberating with the knowledge that when he returned home, he would not only be a free zebra but also a small landowner.\n\nThe establishment of the Federation formalised that process. While the owners were allowed to keep some of their lands, most were given to their former slaves. But by the first harvest, grim reality had replaced hopes and dreams. The irrigation needed to run a productive plantation was impossible with the land split up, and attempts to branch out into other crops to get a more varied diet had reduced yield even further. It had become harder and harder to make ends meet, and eventually the old masters returned.\n\nTheir offer wasn't unfair. But it didn't feel fair, either. A modest sum of money, and an offer of work in exchange for the land. Although they now worked the fields as free zebras and ate better than before, there was a shame in returning to work for the old masters which couldn't be put into words. Then things went from bad to worse. Better equipment arrived, meaning less labour was required and Maitama was thrown out of his job. He couldn't prove it was because he had fought for Bamina, but he couldn't shake that feeling either.\n\nMaitama had been debating between moving to Zano to seek a job there, and taking his gun and going bandit. Then the recruiter arrived, saying Bamina was preparing a crusade. Maitama's hope had been fading, but now it came roaring back. He went with the recruiter, and on the march to the training grounds, he and the other recruits told their stories."
hayzeb.8.a:0 "It will be different this time."

hayzeb.11.t:0 "The Ancient Crown"
hayzeb.11.d:0 "Gelon-Zornu had been conquered many times, but the Zefuwa dynasty had always endured. Mai Gounama was prepared to bend his knee, creaking though it was, to the Queen of the Hayzeb. Just as his forefathers had bent it to the Mazwi. Her "federation" would fall one day, and the Zefuwa dynasty would continue its rule. Gounama approached the Queen's pavillion, set up outside his city just as so many other besiegers had over the years. Eyes watched him as he entered the tent. Not the eyes of soldiers, but the household and field slaves of one of his country estates.\n\nQueen Bamina stood up the moment he entered the tent, brushing off her servants and looking at him with a cocky smile. "Ah, Mai Gounama!" she exclaimed, "I'm happy you've seen reason. However, I am afraid that I cannot accept your offer."\n\nGounama blinked. His eyes glanced at the Takoba sheathed at the Queen's side. "You see, I come here not on my own behalf, but on theirs," Bamina continued, gesturing to the slaves who had started forming a ring around the two monarchs.\n\n"What is this nonsense?" Gounama demanded, "I am willing to accept servitude, but even the Mazwi treated my dynasty with respect. Enough of this charade. Do you accept my submission or do you not?"\n\nBamina's smile grew more disdainful. "I am not who you have to convince. Look around you. Look at the extra stripes on these zebra's backs." She looked about, calling out to the crowd: "Will you pledge allegiance to this zebra and his crown, if he pledges his allegiance to me?"\n\nThe jeers and roars were deafening. As Gounama stood stunned, Bamina drew her sword with lightning speed and made a single horizontal slash. But this time, she turned the blade to hit with the flat, striking the crown off of Gounama's head but leaving his head untouched.\n\nAfter Gounama had been lead out, the Grand Vizier whispered in Bamina's ear that the ancient crown was still there, lying in the dust. Bamina had made her statement, and perhaps this artifact should be preserved. On the other hoof, there was a way the statement could be made stronger still."

hayzeb.11.b:0 "The crown is a symbol of oppression. Trample it."

hayzeb.12.t:0 "Land and Liberty"
hayzeb.12.d:0 "Bamina looked out over the cotton fields of Gelon-Zornu. In the Mazwi era, these plantations had been a great source of wealth for the Hayzeb city-states: fiber was grown here, then imported to the Hayzeb lands where it was woven into fabric, dyed with the indigo her land grew so much of, and finally made into clothes to be sold to the wider Mazwi Empire. But both the cotton and the indigo had another meaning, for the work of harvesting and irrigating the fields was done by slaves.\n\nBamina had spoken to her soldiers, and she didn't want their stories of hardship and the old masters returning to repeat itself. There would be land reform, but it would have to be better organised this time. The idealist in her still wanted the land to be formally owned by the zebras who toiled on it. That was justice. But rather than managing it individually, she'd send out heralds to organise the freedzebras into councils to manage the plantations together, perhaps ten or twenty families each. That way they'd be able to pool their resources and then decide what to do with the fruits of their labours themselves. This risked sparking outright revolt from the aristocracy, and there was no guarantee it would work: once the land was given to the councils, it was out of Bamina's hooves.\n\nAnother option was to lean into her role as a conqueror. The Grand Vizier had suggested that she could simply declare herself to be the new owner of the land, and "just happen" to employ the freedzebras as farmers, giving them a generous wage as befitted servants of the Crown. That seemed imperious and against the spirit of federalism. But it would certainly avert the backfiring that had happened before.\n\nA tiny, cynical voice in her head offered a third option. She could cut the middle steps, and scrap direct land reform in favour of levying a land-based tax to be paid as a lump sum to the freedzebras. That would cause less unrest, and they'd get a far better deal than Maitama's lot."
hayzeb.12.a:0 "That land is for the zebras who toil on it."
hayzeb.12.b:0 "We will appropriate it as crownland."
hayzeb.12.c:0 "Let's not spark a revolt."

hayzeb.13.t:0 "The Gulu Reformers"
hayzeb.13.d:0 "Okusaba paced about. He'd been under armed guard, waiting for news of his companions. Etteka had been wounded fighting the Hayzeb, the crazy fool, and it wasn't clear whether he'd make it. Otulo had recently been found with a broken leg, but alive. The Gulu had lost. The Hayzeb hordes had overrun Ugabi, and perhaps they would overrun all the Great Lakes.\n\nA zebra slipped into his vision. He didn't know how long the old stallion had been there, watched him with brooding eyes. "You must be the Grand Vizier I've heard so much of," Okusaba deduced, "I'm guessing you've come to tell me your Queen's judgment?"\n\n"Very sharp. Close, but no. I've come to give you advice. Bamina is quick to anger, but equally quick to forgive. You may not understand why-"\n\n"Of course I do. She sees the Gulu Tablets as half-measures. She detests us, sees us as weak. There is no reasoning with such fanatics."\n\nThe Grand Vizier nodded. "Your words have some truth to them. The differences between the Gulu and the Chainbreaker are vast. I don't know which way is better. But now, the war is over. The Gulu will have a hoof in governing this region, regardless of who Bamina calls upon to set up the local government. If she does call on you, show your defiance. Do not bow to her easily. She views the Gulu as weakhearted. If you prove her wrong, she may yet respect you, and your vision for Ugabi may be fulfilled. After a fashion.""
hayzeb.13.a:0 "Without another word, he departed."

hayzeb.16.t:0 "A Republic Within the Federation?"
hayzeb.16.d:0 "Uwineza had been held in an old country estate for several weeks now. It wasn't unpleasant, but she couldn't leave. Every day she went over the war. If there was anything she could have done to stop the Hayzeb Queen's hordes. Any tactic she hadn't tried, or weakeness she overlooked. Pacing about the dining room, lost in thought, she only noticed her guest by the smell of the tea as he poured it. Looking up, she saw an elderly zebra sitting in one of the chairs. He gestured for her to sit.\n\n"Who are you?" Uwineza asked, sitting down.\n\n"I am Queen Bamina's Grand Vizier, madam president. I am also far too important and far too frail a zebra to be sent to poison you. Poisons take too long to set in: you would struggle, and in your struggling you could very well kill me. So, you needn't fear sharing some tea with me."\n\nUwineza shrugged, and the two shared a cup of hot tea in silence. The Grand Vizier poured another cup. "You referred to me as madam president," said Uwineza, "Is that some kind of joke?" He shook his head.\n\n"When Bamina marched upon Aoranda, she saw a despot who merely promised liberty. But over the last weeks, I have spoken to your associates, and I understand that is not the full story. It is not your fault the republic turned out like it did. You were trying to build something beautiful, but were surrounded by jackals. Queen Bamina will arrive soon, and I want the two of us to make an offer to her. She's handled Emancipation, she's hunted down the warlords, she's defeated the UCTA. But when she departs, the Federation will need a permanent governance structure here. We can convince her to make the republic into that structure. You, and presidents after you, will handle land reform, creature rights, education, economics, and democracy within Aoranda and Ugabi. She asks only for your allegiance, and your participation within the broader Federation. What say you?""
hayzeb.16.a:0 "Only a fool would refuse."
hayzeb.16.b:0 "A republic swearing allegiance to a monarch? Preposterous."

hayzeb.17.t:0 "No More Republic of Thieves"
hayzeb.17.d:0 "Ziamaka didn't speak the Hayzeb language, but he got along fine with the soldiers who had billetted themselves in his townhouse. They'd come in when the Republican army had retreated, and though it had taken a while to get their meaning across, they'd offered him a bag of millet in exchange for a month's lodging. It seemed like a fair trade, especially compared to the Republican Army ransacking the local general store and his sister's farmhouse for food.\n\nThe Hayzeb had behaved like ruffians, drinking his moonshine and swaggering through town singing into the night. Still, after Ziamaka had helped them with their hangovers, worried they might stab him otherwise, they'd looked ashamed and come back with another bag of millet and a pig. Presumably it was payment for the liquor. Ziamaka was a tinsmith, so he wasn't sure what he'd do with a pig, but he supposed he could give it to his sister.\n\nThe bizarre episode ended when some kind of cleanup crew arrived to build lodgings for the soldiers and scold them for their antics. If this was the garrison he'd have to deal with from now on, they were better than the old lot. Ziamaka couldn't help but share a drink with them when, to the cheers of the townsfolk, a Hayzeb crier read out an announcement in Aorandan:\n\n"By order of Queen Bamina of the Hayzeb, the Republic of Aoranda is henceforth dismantled.  This region is to be under the protection of the Hayzeb army, until the local laws can be brought into the fold of The Federation. President Kjambiya is to be beheaded for banditry and murder.""
hayzeb.17.a:0 "That last one sounds especially good."

hayzeb.18.t:0 "Power Vacuum"
hayzeb.18.d:0 "Ziamaka hid in his root cellar as the warriors flooded into his town. Oh not again, not again. Hadn't the tribes taken enough? First the Mazwi, then the republic, then the tribes... every time an army passed by here, they'd grabbed whatever and whoever they could find, pressing them into service in whatever war they were fighting. What would happen when there was nothing left to take? Would they torch this place out of revenge, or would they tear down the houses to use as firewood on campaign?\n\nZiamaka thought to his sister, snatched away by one of the warlord bands after they'd torched hr farmstead. Without their leaders they had run amock, some allying with the tribes and others fighting them, while still others slinked back to the UCTA. She'd been pressed into service with a musket that was older than their father, and was undoubtedly dead by now.\n\nThe door to the root cellar swung open. Ziamaka winced, and prepared for the worst. What came was less terrifying than... strange. A trio of Hayzeb soldiers and an interpreter walked down and started asking him questions. "Who are you? What is the name of this town? Why is everyzebra hiding?" It took a long time, but eventually the interpreter got the soldiers up to speed. One of them who seemed to be the leader gave him a bag of millet, apparently as a thank you, and then they left.\n\nOver the next few days, a trickle of townspeople were escorted in. Each was given some basic provisions, more if they had lost their homes, and sent on their way. Each had a tale of being captured by the Hayzeb and put in a squalid POW camp, until it was determined that they had been forcibly conscripted and the Hayzeb figured out how to get them home. There was no permanent authority, everything was still chaos. But slowly, as their lost neighbours trickled in, a feeling of normalcy returned to Ziamaka's small town."
hayzeb.18.a:0 "One of the last arrivals was Ziamaka's own sister."

hayzeb.19.t:0 "A strange find"
hayzeb.19.d:0 "The remnants of the UCTA had fought hard. For every one that the Hayzeb counterinsurgency neutralised, they'd bring down several federal troops. But they were just that: remnants. The vast majority of the UCTA had laid down their arms and accepted the Queen's mercy, so it was small wonder that the few who remained were fanatical killers. One group had been operating in a swamp, filling the marshes with improvised landmines made out of old shells. By the time Kazu's squad finally found their hideout, they were all out of action: not from the actions of Kazu's squadmates, but from malaria and malnutrition. As Kazu's sergeant took the wretches into custody,Kazu explored the waterlogged cave they used as a base.\n\nAt the back of the cave, sitting in nearly perfect condition other than an empty fuel tank, rusted tracks and a lack of shells, was something Kazu had never seen before. He'd heard from other units about them though. Great steel monstrosities, carrying cannons and machine guns and rolling over anyzebra in their way, only defeated by overwhelming numbers or the most clever ambushes.\n\n"Sarge!" called Kazu, "You'll wanna see this!""
hayzeb.19.a:0 ""Forget me. The Queen will wanna see this!""

hayzeb.20.t:0 "The Republic Reborn"
hayzeb.20.d:0 ""Uwineza met the Chainbreaker in her old office. Bamina was lounging in Uwineza's favourite chair, reading a book. "Twilight of the Dynasties," by Yazid Al Hudhail. A book of history and political theory, laced through with biting criticism of the Saddle Arabian monarchy, the emirs, and even of Celestia.\n\nBamina glanced up at her. "This is a nice chair," Bamina declared, "And an interesting book. I'd like to borrow it from you. The book, not the chair. This idea of having a founding document formalising the rules of the... nation? That word is used interchangably with the state in this book, which I find odd. The Federation is becoming quite multinational, so we shouldn't confuse the two. I'm sorry, do you speak Hayzeb?"\n\n"Um, yes," said Uwineza, settling into the second-nicest chair in her own office, "As well as Mazwi and some Saddle Arabian. And Ugabian, although that's very close to Aorandan. And yes, Yazid is... well, it's not one hundred percent applicable to the Great Lakes, but it got me thinking, and the ideals within are beautiful. I bought it off a street dealer in banned books when I went to Saddle Arabia. Well, banned books and drugs. I think the books were more of a passion project, while the drugs paid the bills."\n\n"Quite the polyglot. I'm sorry, I was getting sidetracked. Nonetheless, this constitutionalism, it's strange but it seems... well, I may want to pull further on this thread once we've unified the Great Lakes. And I do like the document you've drawn up. I've put my seal on it, you can find it on your desk. As of now you are the president of the Republic of the Central Great Lakes."\n\nUwineza blinked. "Just like that? If you're reading Yazid's earlier stuff, you know how hostile republicans can be to even Harmonic monarchs..."\n\nBamina smiled warmly. "I don't find you hostile. Now, I have to give you your chair back, madame president. Still, I ask you again: may I borrow this book?""
hayzeb.20.a:0 ""Of- of course, Bamina.""

hayzeb.21.t:0 "The Reformer and the Radical"
hayzeb.21.d:0 ""A tribal council?" Bamina scoffed, "Really? You think you'll be able to keep a lid on all those rivalries, all those petty customs and narrow interests?"\n\nOkusaba arched an eyebrow, sipping his waragi. They were sitting under an ancient twisted tree which stood starkly in the middle of a waterlogged field. "It is the best way to ensure stability and representation in this region. Is that not what you want, your majesty? It may seem backwards to you, coming from the city-states, but does your federation not defer to local tribal leaders who know their people?"\n\nBamina rolled her eyes. "Of course we do. When dealing with their own tribes. But we don't gather them together in one place. Local leaders tend to want to preserve their own power, and nowhere more than the central Great Lakes. So excuse me if I doubt whether giving them even more authority will help the common zebra. Many of those tribes, especially in Aoranda, are diehard slavers. Why do you think your clique can get them on board?"\n\nSo this was what the Grand Vizier had warned him about. This was the arrogant radical he had to deal with every single day. "Well, your majesty, we sit them under an old tree like this one, and we talk until we come to an agreement. And if we cannot come to an agreement, we hold votes. We make bargains. In other words, we intend to govern by consensus, just as your federation was always meant to. I apologise if you see that as reactionary."\n\nBamina downed her own waragi, draining her cup to the dregs. "Ach, that is vile stuff. Truly, it tastes like the homebrew we drank in the slums of Zano. I won't pretend I'm happy with this, but you are right, curse you. I would be a hypocrite if I didn't give your clique a chance to do things in their own way. Alright, pour me another cup. Let's keep talking until we reach an agreement.""
hayzeb.21.a:0 "Okusaba obliged with a small smirk."

hayzeb.50.t:0 "A Long Night"
hayzeb.50.d:0 "Bamina was having trouble sleeping. She didn't tell anyone this, but she had nightmares every night. The zebras she'd killed, the suffering she'd witnessed. She'd stained the Great Lakes themselves red in her crusade, the blood seeping into the ground where, hopefully, it would nourish new life rather than salting the Earth. It was simply a matter of how much had been shed, she reasoned, and she had exercised mercy whenever it was an option. But reason mattered little in the realm of nightmares.\n\nHer father: undoubtedly the single zebra who deserved it most out of everyzebra she'd killed. His lifeless eyes gazed at her in her dreams, behind her eyes when she closed them. Within a split second of her deed, she'd had a million reasons why it was just. Why it was necessary. Why it was good. But when she'd drawn her sword and cleaved his head from his shoulders, she'd not been thinking of any of that. No, she'd simply been angry. The rage followed her in her dreams, colouring everything like a lens. It consumed her like fire, leaving her a withered husk, and she'd awake drained.\n\nThe Grand Vizier had put her on a regimen of medicinal tea. She was to drink it every night to help her sleep, and spend at least half an hour completely undisturbed before she closed her eyes. At first it was maddening; now it was routine. None were to disturb the Queen during that time, unless the capital itself was ablaze. Bamina knew it was time now. She set down the letter she'd been working on to console Zaria. It could wait. Her sister would still be there in the morning. She took her tea. Within ten minutes she was already drowsy, and within twenty-five she was asleep in her reading chair. It was only when she missed a meeting with a diplomat the following morning that anyzebra thought it wise to disturb her slumber."
hayzeb.50.a:0 "But when they did, none could wake her."

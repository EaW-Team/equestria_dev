HAY_breaker_of_chains:0 "Broken Chains"
HAY_breaker_of_chains_desc:0 "In the aftermath of Mazwi's disintegration, Bamina rallied an army of slaves and with them united the lands of the Hayzeb. After becoming Queen, she liberated all slaves in the newborn nation and vowed to erase the oppressive institution from all of the Great Lakes, and perhaps even all of Zebrica. While the formerly enslaved masses rejoice, the former slaveowners are furious and many plot the downfall of the Queen."
HAY_city_states:0 "A Federation Of City-States"
HAY_city_states_desc:0 "Hayzeb has traditionally been divided into a number of city-states, which are centered around wealthy trade cities. The new Queen rallied the support of the cities by promising to grant them their historical rights which they had lost under Mazwian rule, but this has meant that the member states of the federation are very autonomous and pay little regard to the Queen and her central government."

 HAY_melee_equipment_0:0 "Iron-Tipped Bows & Spears"
 HAY_melee_equipment_0_short:0 "Bows & Spears"
 HAY_melee_equipment_0_desc:0 "The humble spear and the bow have been the traditional weapons of choice for warriors in the Great Lakes region. The spears and arrows usually have tips of sharpened well-forged iron, capable of piercing the most commonly used protection, padded armour and wooden shields, effectively. Additionally, arrows are often coated in deadly poisons created by potion-makers, meaning even a minor wound can be lethal."
 HAY_melee_equipment_1:0 "Mazwian Matchlock Musket"
 HAY_melee_equipment_1_short:0 "Mazwian Musket"
 HAY_melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "The matchlock musket was a revolutionary weapon in the Great Lakes. With their extensive gold reserves, the Mazwians imported thousands of firearms from abroad and eventually learned to make them by themselves. This weapon was instrumental in their rapid expansion which led to the domination of the Imperial Mazwi for two centuries."
 HAY_infantry_equipment_0:0 "Rifle-Musket"
 HAY_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Rifle-Musket"
 HAY_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Rifled barrels started appearing in the Great Lakes only when foreign rifles were imported from abroad. While initially used alongside traditional smoothbore weapons, the barrels of muskets were gradually replaced with rifled ones. These transitional weapons were rather crude as local blacksmiths were still learning the rifling process and the creation of conical hollow bullets that made rifles more effective than muskets."
 
 HAY_artillery_equipment_0:0 "Iron Cannons"
 HAY_artillery_equipment_0_short:0 "Iron Cannons"
 HAY_artillery_equipment_0_desc:0 "As zebras in the Great Lakes acquired artillery from abroad, they primarily used them on war canoes to dominate the many rivers and lakes of the region. This gave waterborne vessels impressive firepower and greatly increased their importance in warfare. Of course, sometimes it was necessary to use such cannons on land. In such cases cannons were mounted on wheels dragged by a group of slaves."

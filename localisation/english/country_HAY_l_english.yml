### CHARACTERS ###

HAY_queen_bamina:0 "Queen Bamina"

### NATIONAL FOCUSES ###

HAY_the_federation:0 "The Federation"
HAY_the_federation_desc:0 "The Hayzeb federation is a new state, but it has deep roots within Hayzeb traditions and customs. With the slaves liberated and the city-states united under a single queen, the federation can be realized."

HAY_the_queen:0 "And Its Queen"
HAY_the_queen_desc:0 "Queen Bamina has united our people for the first time in our history, throwing off, Mazwi overlords, Yeti raiders and the tyranny of our own slaver class. The commonzebra loudly praise her, the dispossessed slavers secretly curse her, but there is little doubt that she is the keystone of our federation."

HAY_the_lost_cities:0 "The Lost Cities"
HAY_the_lost_cities_desc:0 "Even in this moment of optimism, a stinging pain remains. Some Hayzeb cities, rather than being simply pillaged, were outright absorbed into the domains of the Storm King's warlords, and they still remain under their heel. While we are not yet strong enough to liberate our siblings, many clamour for vengeance against the Yeti tyrants."

HAY_persuade_local_magistrates:0 "Persuade Local Leaders"
HAY_persuade_local_magistrates_desc:0 "The Federation is a beautiful model of governance, but it is also frustrating. Local leaders are blocking efforts to centralise the army, and unlike a Mazwi emperor, the Queen cannot simply have their heads. We must persuade them to focus on the bigger picture."

HAY_appeal_to_commoners:0 "Appeal To The Commonfolk"
HAY_appeal_to_commoners_desc:0 "The demands of the local magistrates are unreasonable and bordering on corruption. Their loyalty is highly suspect. We may not be able to remove them directly, but the commonfolk are on our side. They will pressure their leaders to either get on board with the Queen's plan, or step down in favour of somezebra who will."

HAY_quid_pro_quo:0 "Quid Pro Quo"
HAY_quid_pro_quo_desc:0 "The demands of the local magistrates may be unreasonable, they may be bordering on corruption, but they are who we have to deal with. We will get what we want through negotiation, or not at all."

HAY_tour_the_federation:0 "Tour the Federation"
HAY_tour_the_federation_desc:0 "Bamina is the first Queen of all Hayzeb, and it behooves her to see her subjects and learn of their lives. The Grand Vizier has planned a tour of the cities and otwns of the Federation for her and her half-sister Zaria."

HAY_tour_the_capital:0 "Tour the Capital"
HAY_tour_the_capital_desc:0 "The Queen may hold many of them in contempt, but it is best for the aristocracy to be on our side when possible. The Grand Vizier has prepared a tour of the capital for Queen Bamina to meet these potentates and assuage their fears, although she may have other ideas in mind..."

HAY_lead_by_example:0 "Lead By Example"
HAY_lead_by_example_desc:0 "Queen Bamina has always preferred to lead from the front and mingle with her followers rather than staying  in the palace. Now that the federation is more or less secure, she can return to training the soldiers."

HAY_sacred_vow:0 "Our Sacred Vow"
HAY_sacred_vow_desc:0 "Queen Bamina made a sacred vow during her rebellion to liberate every slave in the Great Lakes. She will now publicly reaffirm that vow before the great and the small of the federation, and call upon them to march with her."

HAY_resharpen_your_weapons:0 "Resharpen Your Weapons"
HAY_resharpen_your_weapons_desc:0 ""Resharpen your weapons, Hayzeb. Freedom is not a bounty to be reaped, but an ideal to be fought for!"\n-Bamina, Queen of All Hayzeb"

HAY_muster_army:0 "Muster the Federal Army"
HAY_muster_army_desc:0 "The federal army is a motley assortment, but they are the most professional soldiers in our service. We must call them up, away from their individual districts and to the capital, in order to impose a common training regimen on them."

HAY_rally_rabble:0 "Rally the Rabble"
HAY_rally_rabble_desc:0 "Queen Bamina's personal army of freed slaves are fanatical and dedicated. They won the battles of the rebellion, although more through numbers and bloody-minded determination than through skill. In a perfect world they would be disbanded into the regular army, but until we have secured our borders they will form a vital part of our armies."

HAY_use_our_people:0 "Inspire Our People"
HAY_use_our_people_desc:0 "We will send our storytellers across the federation, rallying our people to take on their Queen's oath. Soon, Bamina's quest will become the quest of all Hayzeb."

HAY_use_their_people:0 "Inspire Their People"
HAY_use_their_people_desc:0 "We will send agitators and storytellers ahead of our army, promising to the slaves of the Great Lakes that liberation is coming. When our armies arrive at each new petty kingdom, these agitators will rally the downtrodden to help us in our advance."

HAY_march_of_the_chainbreaker:0 "March of the Chainbreaker"
HAY_march_of_the_chainbreaker_desc:0 "It is time to fulfil our oath. The Chainbreaker's march begins today, and it does not stop until the Great Lakes are liberated from slavery and tyranny."

HAY_fate_of_the_crown:0 "The Crown of Gelon-Zornu"
HAY_fate_of_the_crown_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Gelon-Zornu, the Zefuwa dynasty, and its crown have existed since time immemorial. There are many who believe that no matter how many times they are conquered, that dynasty will rise again. It is time we disabused them of that notion."

HAY_rehabilitate_minor_chiefs:0 "Rehabilitate Minor Nobles"
HAY_rehabilitate_minor_chiefs_desc:0 "Slavery was near-omnipresent as an institution in Gelon-Zornu, but we Hayzeb were not so innocent either. If we are to incorporate the Zornu thread into the weave of the federation, we must work with local leaders rather than exacting vengeance on them, even after casting down the largest and cruellest of the masters."

HAY_liberate_zornu_slaves:0 "Liberate the Slaves of Gelon-Zornu"
HAY_liberate_zornu_slaves_desc:0 "The slaves of Gelon-Zornu were freedzebras the instant we planted our banners. Still, many slaves do not know this, and still work for their old masters. We will send out our heralds and our soldiers to ensure none are still in bondage. Some will join our armies, others will remain in their villages, and still others will move to the cities to find work there, as free zebras."

HAY_integrate_zornu:0 "The District of Gelon-Zornu"
HAY_integrate_zornu_desc:0 "The ancient kingdom of Gelon-Zornu has been cast down and its subjects liberated. Only one thing remains before it can be integrated as a district of our federation. We must decide what to do with the lands of the former slaver-nobles, and how best to set up the freedzebras for a better life."

HAY_attack_ZUG:0 "The March Continues"
HAY_attack_ZUG_desc:0 "Ugabi: a land of half-measures, where the freedzebras are left destitute and the young are press-ganged into a ruthless army. Aoranda: a "republic" which beneath their prattle is simply another despotism, promising freedom tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow. Both reliant on vicious warlords to secure their power. Both shall be swept aside in the chainbreaker's march."

HAY_crushing_warlords:0 "Hunt Down the Warlords"
HAY_crushing_warlords_desc:0 "Both Ugabi and Aoranda were plagued by warlords, whether they wore the discipline of the UCTA or the brutality of the "Madmare of Aoranda." The remnants of their armies will be allowed to return home -if their former neighbours will have them- but the warlords, and any who refuse our offer, will be hunted down without mercy."

HAY_the_republican_idealist:0 "The Vanquished Republic"
HAY_the_republican_idealist_desc:0 "Now that the warlords have been driven out and the region brought to heel, will take stock of what is left of the failed Aorandan republican experiment. Perhaps there is something worth incorporating into our federation?"

HAY_absorb_gulu_remnants:0 "The Gulu Remnants"
HAY_absorb_gulu_remnants_desc:0 "We are not tyrants: we do not come to humiliate and plunder, but to unite. While the Gulu reformers of Ugabi may have been far too complacent to bring about true liberation, their ideals of tribal democracy could form an excellent basis for integrating the Ugabians into the federation."


### DECISIONS ###

HAY_national_mood_cat:0 "The National Mood"
HAY_national_mood_cat_desc:0 "Bamina's government is popular among commoners, particularly freedzebras she liberated from slavery. However, it attracts suspicion from the aristocracy, particularly former slaveowners.\n\nHigher commoner §RZeal§! will increase the military effects of the §YZeal and Suspicion§! national spirit, while higher aristocratic §CSuspicion§! will increase its impact on your §Ystability§! and §Ypolitical power§!.\n\nThe mood of the commoners and the mood of the aristocracy affect one another. Having one high and the other low will naturally cause whichever is lower to steadily §Yincrease§!. Being at war will cause both to slowly trend up, while peace will cause both to slowly trend down.\n\nCurrently, the commoners are [HAY.GetCommonerMood], and [HAY.GetCommonerDrift].\nCurrently, the aristocracy are [HAY.GetNobleMood], and [HAY.GetNobleDrift].\n\nTemporary display for the sake of simple code:\nZealotry: [?HAY_NM_zealotry|%] - Drift: [?HAY_NM_Z_drift|%+]\nPlotting: [?HAY_NM_plotting|%] - Drift: [?HAY_NM_P_drift|%+]"



HAY_reassure_aristocrats:0 "Reassure the Aristocracy"
HAY_reassure_aristocrats_desc:0 "Queen Bamina will take a moment away from the troops to speak with landowners and former slaveowners, assuaging rumours that she is planning mass retribution on them."

HAY_rally_commoners:0 "Rally the Commoners"
HAY_rally_commoners_desc:0 "Queen Bamina will spend extra time mingling with the common zebras, letting the tales of her geniality and generosity spread as she does."

HAY_root_out_plotters:0 "Root Out Plotters"
HAY_root_out_plotters_desc:0 "The Grand Vizier warns of plots behind every corner, and asks only our leave in dealing with them. If circumstances become dire, we can use his network to root out our enemies."

HAY_discourage_fanatics:0 "Dissuade the Fanatics"
HAY_discourage_fanatics_desc:0 "The zeal of certain freedzebra is getting out of hoof. Bamina will meet with these fanatics personally and remind them that she is just a zebra, and that vengeance is not the way."

HAY_federal_cohesion_cat:0 "The State of the Federation"
HAY_federal_cohesion_cat_desc:0 "While each region has a §Ylocal governor§! acting as a point of contact, the §PHayzeb Queen§! rules through a complex weave of local authorities. These include village councils, tribal or clan leaders, merchant guilds, elected mayors, priests and wise-zebras, and so on; some loyal, some less so.\n\nHow efficient this complex system is varies, and is represented by a region's §Clocal cohesion§!. Low §CLocal Cohesion§! applies a penalty to §YRecruitable population§! and §YConstruction speed§!. The average of §Clocal cohesion§! between all regions forms the §Cfederal cohesion§!, which applies modifiers to §YStability§!, §Ypolitical power gain§!, and §Yconsumer goods factories§!."

### IDEAS ###

HAY_breaker_of_chains:0 "Broken Chains"
HAY_breaker_of_chains_desc:0 "In the aftermath of Mazwi's disintegration, Bamina rallied an army of slaves and with them united the lands of the Hayzeb. After becoming Queen, she liberated all slaves in the newborn nation and vowed to erase the oppressive institution from all of the Great Lakes, and perhaps even all of Zebrica. While the formerly enslaved masses rejoice, the former slaveowners are furious and many plot the downfall of the Queen."
HAY_city_states:0 "A Federation Of City-States"
HAY_city_states_desc:0 "Hayzeb has traditionally been divided into a number of city-states, which are centered around wealthy trade cities. The new Queen rallied the support of the cities by promising to grant them their historical rights which they had lost under Mazwian rule, but this has meant that the member states of the federation are very autonomous and pay little regard to the Queen and her central government."
HAY_inciting_rebellion:0 "Inciting Rebellion"
HAY_inciting_rebellion_desc:0 "We are stirring discontent among the slaves and the dispossessed of our future enemies. When we strike, they will strike with us, but we cannot fully control what these rebels will do."
HAY_rallying_people:0 "Rallying Our People"
HAY_rallying_people_desc:0 "we are rallying our people for the fight ahead, reiterating our message so that everyzebra knows they fight for freedom, whether on the battlefield or in the workshops."
HAY_fomenting_unrest:0 "Fomenting Unrest"
HAY_fomenting_unrest_desc:0 "We are appealing directly to our people against their intransigent local leaders. This is destabilizing the Federation, but will bring these magistrates to heel."
HAY_promises_to_magistrates:0 "Promises to Magistrates"
HAY_promises_to_magistrates_desc:0 "We are making promises and offering gifts to the intransigent magistrates in the federation. Their loyalty is questionable at bst, but with the right incentives they will fall in line."
HAY_national_mood_modifier:0 "The National Mood"
HAY_national_mood_modifier_desc:0 "While the freedzebras are enthusiastic to the point of zealotry about the current government, the aristocracy scheme against it."

### TOOLTIPS ###

HAY_natmood_decision:0 "We are already influencing the national mood"
HAY_inciting_rebellion_tt:0 "Will cause §Yenemies§! to suffer §Rriots and strikes§! upon the declaration of war."
HAY_unrest_tt:0 "Will increase our weekly §Rzealotry§! drift by §Y1%§!\nUpon removal, will increase §Ywar support§! by §Y10%§! and §Gfederal cohesion§! in [STATE] by §Y20%.§!"
HAY_promises_tt:0 "Will increase our weekly §Cplotting§! drift by §Y1%§!\nUpon removal, will increase §Ywar support§! by §Y10%§! and §Gfederal cohesion§! in [STATE] by §Y20%.§!"

HAY_NM_plotting_add_5_tt:0 "This will increase our §Cplotting§! by 5."
HAY_NM_zealotry_add_5_tt:0 "This will increase our §Rzealotry§! by 5."
HAY_NM_zealotry_add_10_tt:0 "This will increase our §Rzealotry§! by 10."
HAY_NM_zealotry_subtract_5_tt:0 "This will reduce our §Rzealotry§! by 5."

### EVENTS ###

hayzeb.1.t:0 "The Federal System"
hayzeb.1.d:0 "Officially, the Hayzeb Federation was founded by Queen Bamina a mere six months ago when the Hayzeb city-states united for the first time following Mazwi's collapse. In reality, the Federation formalises the Hayzeb system of governance which predates the Mazwi.\n\nOur system is not a chain, like the Mazwi: an endless series of links forged by iron and oaths, binding slave to petty-master, petty-master to local chieftain, local chieftain to regional governor, and on and on to the Mansa in the capital. Nor is our system a sword, like the yetis: rule by direct force, the distribution of loot, the respect and fear of individual warlords for their conqueror-king. Our system is not forged in iron at all.\n\nOur system has always more closely resembled a basket. Lines of kinship, commerce, friendship and leadership woven together, intersecting across regional, tribal, and caste lines. Mutually supporting and interconnecting. This held true before the Mazwi, it held true under them, it held true when half of our city-states were Mazwi-ruled and half were not, and it holds true today.\n\nThe abolition of slavery, radical though it was, will purify this system. Between that and independence, we have removed the strands of iron which wore away at the wicker and fiber which made up the rest of the basket. Expansion will challenge this system. Adding new strands is never easy. But we will succeed, and bring all the Great Lakes into our weave."
hayzeb.1.a:0 "Long Live the Federation!"

hayzeb.2.t:0 "The Chainbreaker"
hayzeb.2.d:0 "Bamina looked out the window to the city below. Behind her, The Grand Vizier was sorting through petitions. "This one might interest you, your majesty," he said. Bamina didn't turn to face him, but that was normal, so he continued. "A mare has been sentenced to die by the laws of her tribe for killing the son of her former owner. This petition, which was signed by scores of members of her tribe, says she killed him a year ago while he tried to drag her back into slavery, and asks for a royal pardon."\n\n"Stay the execution," said Bamina, "But allow the tribal leaders to exile her to preserve the peace, if they must. Include a private letter to her with a small sum of money and an offer to work as a cleaner in the palace if she is exiled."\n\n"Very wise, your majesty."\n\n"I am as you made me," said the queen, and for a time it seemed she would remain silent for the rest of the afternoon. "How did we get here?" she finally asked, "How is this palace not rubble beneath our hooves? The Mazwi, the Storm King, me... so much devastation, and yet this palace still stands. Once it was not even really a royal palace. Once it was my father's house, and my cage. And now..."\n\n"Now you are the first Queen of all the Hayzeb, and he is dead," finished the Grand Vizier, "A footnote in the glorious story of your reign."\n\n"Glorious? Perhaps. Or perhaps it will be ruinous. Perhaps what began in blood will end in blood."\n\n"Blood is the way of the world, your majesty. You haven't stopped looking out that window. What do you see?"\n\n"I see my people, going about their business in the market square. Once in a while, one of them looks up to this palace. I wonder if they see me looking down at them. I wonder what they think.""
hayzeb.2.a:0 ""Your people put their faith in you, your majesty.""

hayzeb.3.t:0 "The Great Humiliation"
hayzeb.3.d:0 "Another refugee column crossed the border yesterday. They said the Yeti warlord Gyz Windborn had been forcing their relatives to fight as cannonfodder, and they fled to escape the same fate. Many arrived wounded or sick, with one dying from an infected wound inflicted by their pursuers mere hours after crossing our border.\n\nThese refugees are Hayzeb, one and all. They hail from the town of Zumbana, which alongside Munmane and Zpasu had been ocuppied since the Storm King's initial rampage. There are few cultural differences between them and us, but the difference in lifestyle is night and day. While we enjoy the fruits of freedom, they labour in chains far heavier than any the Mazwi put on us. While we sleep soundly, they stay up night after night praying that they will not be taken from their homes by the next press-gang.\n\nYesterday, the escapees crossed our borders. Today, the yetis make examples out of those who didn't make it. They stand there, mocking us, showing their other slaves what fate awaits runaways - and showing us what they will do to us once their own civil war is over. We lack the means to wage war on them directly: they have superior weapons, they are twice our size, and even if we defeat one warlord we would have to fight the other three while lowering our guard to the war looming in the Great Lakes. Still, several rural chieftains have arranged war parties with the intention of striking into their territory and liberating as many as possible. They ask only for their queen's blessing. Alternately, we can tell them to adopt a subtler approach, smuggling slaves out one-by-one and devoting our resources to aiding and resettling those who make it to our borders."
hayzeb.3.a:0 "Help as many make it out as we can."
hayzeb.3.b:0 "Prepare a raiding party."

hayzeb.4.t:0 "The Other Side of Federalism"
hayzeb.4.d:0 "TODO Bamina wants to ready the army but local leaders are being intransigent, they have little respect for her authority. Grand Vizier councils buying them out, but Bamina gets a bad taste in her mouth and considers just stirring up the commoners to pressure their leaders."
hayzeb.4.a:0 "Governing isn't easy."

hayzeb.5.t:0 "The Soldier-Queen"
hayzeb.5.d:0 "The Grand Vizier was getting on in years, but his eyes were as sharp as ever. Sharp enough to peer through the new telescope he'd gotten shipped from Timbucktu, despite the glare of the noonday sun. On the other side of the glass, he could see her. Queen Bamina, working away at some ditch. She was showing a couple recruits how to dig, and the Grand Vizier chuckled at the sight.\n\n"What is she doing?" asked Zaria, behind him. Wordlessly, the Grand Vizier stepped back and motioned for the filly to look through the glass. After messing with it for a few seconds, Zaria finally managed to get the lens focused on her sister. "Why is she... digging? Did she find gold?"\n\n"No," the Grand Vizier chuckled at her childish innocence. "She's showing the recruits how to dig foxholes."\n\n"That's not very regal. Father always told me not to talk to common soldiery and not to get dirty. She's filthy! It's gotten all over her clothes!" Zaria started laughing, nudging the telescope and losing her sister entirely. "Oh horseapples!" she exclaimed.\n\n"Watch your manners, young one," the Grand Vizier cautioned her. "Your half-sister grew up poor, remember? When she was your age she dressed in rags. For her, this kind of work seems natural. And the soldiers love her for it. Of course, with our Queen always out there among the commoners, it falls to me to handle the court most of the time. She's a very different kind of ruler than her father. And when Bamina is gone, you will be whatever kind of ruler you wish to be, child. But for now, I'll try to educate you like I educated her.""
hayzeb.5.a:0 "Governing isn't easy, but neither is digging ditches..."

hayzeb.6.t:0 "The Sacred Vow"
hayzeb.6.d:0 "TODO Bamina declares her goals in a fiery speech. Many local chieftains, themselves former slaveowners or slavetraders but still influential, look worriedly at each other while freedzebras cheer Bamina's name."
hayzeb.6.a:0 "The freedzebras cheered, while the oppressors winced."

hayzeb.7.t:0 "Weapons New and Old"
hayzeb.7.d:0 "Zarki examined his new weapon in wonder. He knew the moment he picked it up that he would never go back to his old musket. Loading powder and bullet in a single metal cartridge, it meant goodbye to the old ramrod. He just had to work a simple lever, insert a round, and it was ready to fire. It had a clean sight built into it, adjustable for distance out to 1200 meters. Zarki had shot out to 1200 meters, but with this thing he just might be able to. It was inlaid with brass and could fit a razor-sharp bayonet. He was just about to thank his sergeant for getting them a batch of the new rifles, when he heard his sergeant holler:\n\n"Ah yes, this is what they want us to fight with! Hah! This will win all our future wars. How optimistic our Queen is!" The sergeant was joined by raucus laughter as he slung his rifle and drew his Takoba. "Friends, don't listen to any of it. Rifles are fine, but in the end this is what carries the day!"\n\nHe swung the sword in a glittering arc, its double edges gleaming in the sun. "Finest Mazwi Steel, this!" the sergeant boasted, "I'd like to see one of those things lop off a yeti's arm. Practice your markszebraship, but never forget: the sword is king!""
hayzeb.7.a:0 "Bad advice spoken with infinite confidence."

hayzeb.8.t:0 "The Ancient Crown"
hayzeb.8.d:0 "TODO Bamina knocks Gouanama's crown into the dust, can either order it preserved or trampled upon."
hayzeb.8.a:0 "It IS of great historical importance..."
hayzeb.8.b:0 "The crown is a symbol of oppression. Trample it."

hayzeb.9.t:0 "Gelon-Zornu Land Reform?"
hayzeb.9.d:0 "TODO Bamina wants to distribute the land of the GZ nobility to their former slaves, but this could cause rebellion and food shortfalls. Grand Vizier presents three options: 1. go through with land reform, but with village councils to manage the plantations. 2. parcel out some of it, but have the rest taken as crownland and employ the freedzebras as workers. 3. Parcel out some of it but leave most of the plantations intact, with the former slavers paying lump sums to their slaves and becoming bourgeois."
hayzeb.9.a:0 "That land is for the zebras who toil on it."
hayzeb.9.b:0 "We will appropriate it as crownland."
hayzeb.9.c:0 "Let's not spark a rebellion."

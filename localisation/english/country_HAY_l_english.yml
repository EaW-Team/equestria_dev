### DECISIONS ###

HAY_national_mood_cat:0 "The National Mood"
HAY_national_mood_cat_desc:0 "Bamina's government is popular among commoners, particularly freedzebras she liberated from slavery. However, it attracts suspicion from the aristocracy, particularly former slaveowners.\n\nHigher commoner §RZeal§! will increase the military effects of the §YZeal and Suspicion§! national spirit, while higher aristocratic §CSuspicion§! will increase its impact on your §Ystability§! and §Ypolitical power§!.\n\nThe mood of the commoners and the mood of the aristocracy affect one another. Having one high and the other low will naturally cause whichever is lower to steadily §Yincrease§!. Being at war will cause both to slowly trend up, while peace will cause both to slowly trend down.\n\nCurrently, the commoners are [HAY.GetCommonerMood], and [HAY.GetCommonerDrift].\nCurrently, the aristocracy are [HAY.GetNobleMood], and [HAY.GetNobleDrift]."

HAY_reassure_aristocrats:0 "Reassure the Aristocracy"
HAY_reassure_aristocrats_desc:0 "Queen Bamina will take a moment away from the troops to speak with landowners and former slaveowners, assuaging rumours that she is planning mass retribution on them."

HAY_rally_commoners:0 "Rally the Commoners"
HAY_rally_commoners_desc:0 "Queen Bamina will spend extra time mingling with the common zebras, letting the tales of her geniality and generosity spread as she does."

HAY_root_out_plotters:0 "Root Out Plotters"
HAY_root_out_plotters_desc:0 "The Grand Vizier warns of plots behind every corner, and asks only our leave in dealing with them. If circumstances become dire, we can use his network to root out our enemies."

HAY_discourage_fanatics:0 "Dissuade the Fanatics"
HAY_discourage_fanatics_desc:0 "The zeal of certain freedzebra is getting out of hoof. Bamina will meet with these fanatics personally and remind them that she is just a zebra, and that vengeance is not the way."

### IDEAS ###

HAY_breaker_of_chains:0 "Broken Chains"
HAY_breaker_of_chains_desc:0 "In the aftermath of Mazwi's disintegration, Bamina rallied an army of slaves and with them united the lands of the Hayzeb. After becoming Queen, she liberated all slaves in the newborn nation and vowed to erase the oppressive institution from all of the Great Lakes, and perhaps even all of Zebrica. While the formerly enslaved masses rejoice, the former slaveowners are furious and many plot the downfall of the Queen."
HAY_city_states:0 "A Federation Of City-States"
HAY_city_states_desc:0 "Hayzeb has traditionally been divided into a number of city-states, which are centered around wealthy trade cities. The new Queen rallied the support of the cities by promising to grant them their historical rights which they had lost under Mazwian rule, but this has meant that the member states of the federation are very autonomous and pay little regard to the Queen and her central government."

### EVENTS ###

hayzeb.1.t:0 "The Federal System"
hayzeb.1.d:0 "Officially, the Hayzeb Federation was founded by Queen Bamina a mere six months ago when the Hayzeb city-states united for the first time following Mazwi's collapse. In reality, the Federation formalises the Hayzeb system of governance which predates the Mazwi.\n\nOur system is not a chain, like the Mazwi: an endless series of links forged by iron and oaths, binding slave to petty-master, petty-master to local chieftain, local chieftain to regional governor, and on and on to the Mansa in the capital. Nor is our system a sword, like the yetis: rule by direct force, the distribution of loot, the respect and fear of individual warlords for their conqueror-king. Our system is not forged in iron at all.\n\nOur system has always more closely resembled a basket. Lines of kinship, commerce, friendship and leadership woven together, intersecting across regional, tribal, and caste lines. Mutually supporting and interconnecting. This held true before the Mazwi, it held true under them, it held true when half of our city-states were Mazwi-ruled and half were not, and it holds true today.\n\nThe abolition of slavery, radical though it was, will purify this system. Between that and independence, we have removed the strands of iron which wore away at the wicker and fiber which made up the rest of the basket. Expansion will challenge this system. Adding new strands is never easy. But we will succeed, and bring all the Great Lakes into our weave."
hayzeb.1.a:0 "Long Live the Federation!"

hayzeb.2.t:0 "The Chainbreaker"
hayzeb.2.d:0 "TODO Bamina reminisces on her rise to power to the Grand Vizier"
hayzeb.2.a:0 "The Hayzeb put their faith in you, your majesty."

hayzeb.3.t:0 "The Enduring Humiliation"
hayzeb.3.d:0 "TODO yeah we beat the Mazwi and our own slaveowners but some of our towns have fallen under Yeti control and that suuuuucks"
hayzeb.3.a:0 "Help as many make it out as we can."
hayzeb.3.b:0 "Prepare a raiding party."

hayzeb.4.t:0 "The Other Side of Federalism"
hayzeb.4.d:0 "TODO Bamina wants to ready the army but local leaders are being intransigent, they have little respect for her authority. Grand Vizier councils buying them out, but Bamina gets a bad taste in her mouth and considers just stirring up the commoners to pressure their leaders."
hayzeb.4.a:0 "Governing isn't easy."

hayzeb.5.t:0 "The Soldier-Queen"
hayzeb.5.d:0 "TODO Grand Vizier watches with a Timbucktu-made telescope as Bamina oversees the construction of a ring of redoubts. He chuckles, content to manage things while Bamina leads the troops."
hayzeb.5.a:0 "Governing isn't easy, but neither is digging ditches..."

hayzeb.6.t:0 "The Sacred Vow"
hayzeb.6.d:0 "TODO Bamina declares her goals in a fiery speech. Many local chieftains, themselves former slaveowners or slavetraders but still influential, look worriedly at each other while freedzebras cheer Bamina's name."
hayzeb.6.a:0 "The freedzebras cheered, while the oppressors winced."

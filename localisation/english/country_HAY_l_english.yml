### DECISIONS ###

HAY_national_mood_cat:0 "The National Mood"
HAY_national_mood_cat_desc:0 "Bamina's government is popular among commoners, particularly freedzebras she liberated from slavery. However, it attracts suspicion from the aristocracy, particularly former slaveowners.\n\nHigher commoner §RZeal§! will increase the military effects of the §YZeal and Suspicion§! national spirit, while higher aristocratic §CSuspicion§! will increase its impact on your §Ystability§! and §Ypolitical power§!.\n\nThe mood of the commoners and the mood of the aristocracy affect one another. Having one high and the other low will naturally cause whichever is lower to steadily §Yincrease§!. Being at war will cause both to slowly trend up, while peace will cause both to slowly trend down.\n\nCurrently, the commoners are [HAY.GetCommonerMood], and [HAY.GetCommonerDrift].\nCurrently, the aristocracy are [HAY.GetNobleMood], and [HAY.GetNobleDrift]."

### IDEAS ###

HAY_breaker_of_chains:0 "Broken Chains"
HAY_breaker_of_chains_desc:0 "In the aftermath of Mazwi's disintegration, Bamina rallied an army of slaves and with them united the lands of the Hayzeb. After becoming Queen, she liberated all slaves in the newborn nation and vowed to erase the oppressive institution from all of the Great Lakes, and perhaps even all of Zebrica. While the formerly enslaved masses rejoice, the former slaveowners are furious and many plot the downfall of the Queen."
HAY_city_states:0 "A Federation Of City-States"
HAY_city_states_desc:0 "Hayzeb has traditionally been divided into a number of city-states, which are centered around wealthy trade cities. The new Queen rallied the support of the cities by promising to grant them their historical rights which they had lost under Mazwian rule, but this has meant that the member states of the federation are very autonomous and pay little regard to the Queen and her central government."

### EVENTS ###

hayzeb.1.t:0 "The Federal System"
hayzeb.1.d:0 "TODO our govenment is not a chain like the Mazwi or a sword like the Yeti, it is a basket woven from many strands."
hayzeb.1.a:0 "Long Live the Federation!"

hayzeb.2.t:0 "The Chainbreaker"
hayzeb.2.d:0 "TODO Bamina reminisces on her rise to power to the Grand Vizier"
hayzeb.2.a:0 "The Hayzeb put their faith in you, your majesty."

hayzeb.3.t:0 "The Enduring Humiliation"

hayzeb.3.b:0 "Prepare a raiding party."

hayzeb.4.t:0 "The Other Side of Federalism"
hayzeb.4.d:0 "TODO Bamina wants to ready the army but local leaders are being intransigent, they have little respect for her authority. Grand Vizier councils buying them out, but Bamina gets a bad taste in her mouth and considers just stirring up the commoners to pressure their leaders."
hayzeb.4.a:0 "Governing isn't easy."

hayzeb.5.t:0 "The Soldier-Queen"
hayzeb.5.d:0 "TODO Grand Vizier watches with a Timbucktu-made telescope as Bamina oversees the construction of a ring of redoubts. He chuckles, content to manage things while Bamina leads the troops."
hayzeb.5.a:0 "Governing isn't easy, but neither is digging ditches..."

hayzeb.6.t:0 "The Sacred Vow"
hayzeb.6.d:0 "TODO Bamina declares her goals in a fiery speech. Many local chieftains, themselves former slaveowners or slavetraders but still influential, look worriedly at each other while freedzebras cheer Bamina's name."
hayzeb.6.a:0 "The freedzebras cheered, while the oppressors winced."

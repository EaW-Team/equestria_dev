#### FOCUS

VER_everygriff_revolutionary:0 "With Blood On Our Claws"
VER_everygriff_revolutionary_desc:0 "The nobility have used the griffons of Verenia as pawns in their squabble over inheritance for too long. No more! The commongriffs have risen  to fight for themselves. They fight for their freedom and their own ideals, not the whims of distant nobles."
VER_steal_weapons:0 "Now We Will Fight Through"
VER_steal_weapons_desc:0 "The nobility is constantly gathering and stockpiling guns for use in their petty squabbles over inheritance. The revolutionaries, however, need them far more and will gladly take them to liberate themselves from their former masters."
VER_more_militias:0 "They Can't Hold Us"
VER_more_militias_desc:0 "Brave griffons have stepped up and put their lives on the line to start the revolution. They will not be alone. Their willingness to fight and die for a better future for the commongriff will inspire others to stand and fight for their freedom."
VER_crush_the_other_two:0 "No Respite\nUntil We Are Free"
VER_crush_the_other_two_desc:0 "One House has been toppled, but two more still remain. The destruction of one is not enough. The revolution will not stop until every House and reactionary has been cast down and every griffon set free!"
VER_revolutionaries_behind_lines:0 "The Taller They Stand"
VER_revolutionaries_behind_lines_desc:0 "When the revolution began, it was made up entirely of lower-class griffons who endured the brunt of the nobility's squabbling. The recent success of the revolution has stirred up a new resolve within Verenia's burgeoning middle class, inspiring a whole new group of griffons with the ideal of freedom!"
VER_hang_and_burn:0 "The Harder They Fall"
VER_hang_and_burn_desc:0 "Finally, the leading tyrannical houses have been torn down and laid to waste. But they cannot take all of the blame for the suffering of the masses. All members of the nobility share the blame, so they will all share the rope as well."
VER_close_the_economy:0 "Each And Everygriff Starts New"
VER_close_the_economy_desc:0 "For decades, the griffons of Verenia have let distant, unfamiliar figures control them. After finally freeing themselves, why would they leave the economy open to strangers outside of their land? The wealth of Verenia will be controlled by its griffons, as it always should have been.""
VER_verenia_is_free:0 "Can You Feel The New Day Rising"
VER_verenia_is_free_desc:0 "Fighting for something they truly believed in, Verenia's griffons have seized their destiny in their claws. For the first time, they are free to choose for themselves. No matter what comes next, it will be done by the will of free griffons!"

ERI_knights_tech:0 "Paladin Technology"
ERI_knights:0 "Paladins"
ERI_knights_desc:0 "The origin of paladins are mired in myth and legend, but scant historical records show that they were present since the early days of organised Verenian polity. For outsiders, it is difficult to tell what exactly makes them different from knights, besides their zealous displays of sanctitude and sashes draped over their armour, for they fight much like knights, but would take great offence at being considered the equal to their "lesser" brethren."
ERI_tech_knights:0 "Paladin Division I"
ERI_tech_knights_desc:0 "Brave, gallant and unyielding, the Verenian noble houses greatly value their paladin companies. They would sooner part with their idols than even a single of these pious warriors, and their battlefield prowess matches their reputation. If they have a flaw, it is their obsession with mêlée combat, rather than simply shooting the foe."
ERI_tech_knights2:0 "Paladin Division II"
ERI_tech_knights2_desc:0 "Training regimens remain hopelessly outdated. While the paladins venerate the ancient traditions, the excess that has been proven obsolete must be excised for better unit performance."
ERI_tech_knights_magical:0 "Household Recruits"
ERI_tech_knights_magical_desc:0 "Although paladinhood has never been exclusive to nobility, in practice only a scant few outside of the higher castes have managed to both pass its trials and afford the equipment. Only those with the purest of blood are worthy enough to carry on the blessed traditions of paladins."
ERI_tech_knights_magical2:0 "Highest Standards"
ERI_tech_knights_magical2_desc:0 "Being a noble does not result in having an easy way through paladinhood — each and every griff must perform equally good as the best of us. The competitive mindset produces paladins who are more than a match for their instructors."
ERI_tech_knights_regular:0 "Commoner Recruits"
ERI_tech_knights_regular_desc:0 "Paladinhood isn't about which family name you carry, but your own conviction and devotion to a higher cause. There are plenty of commoners who would make exemplary paladins, but their own lack of idols preclude them from such. The Order shall help the less fortunate ones with monetary assistance."
ERI_tech_knights_regular2:0 "Proud Ones"
ERI_tech_knights_regular2_desc:0 "Pride is generally looked down upon as unwelcome behaviour, but for paladins, it is a part of their creed. They are better not because they've arrogantly deluded themselves into such, nor for their superior equipment, but because of an attitude that produces effective results."
ERI_tech_knights3:0 "Paladin Division III"
ERI_tech_knights3_desc:0 "Although the paladins get the first share in latest weaponry, it does not magically result in them gaining proficiency with it. Further improvements in training are required to avoid misfires and accidents."
ERI_tech_knights_a:0 "Paladin Division IV"
ERI_tech_knights_a_desc:0 "Armour enchanters have been in a technological arms race with weapon designers since the invention of gunpowder. Further investments in hardier enchantments are needed to ensure paladins can weather most of the incoming fire."
ERI_tech_knights_b:0 "Paladin Division V"
ERI_tech_knights_b_desc:0 "Paladins have always led the charge from the front, a vanguard of the few but brave! Yet massed formations are no longer suitable in the age of artillery strikes and aerial bombardment. Small scale tactics are in need of refinement to ensure each paladin is an army on their own, avoiding unnecessary casualties."

#### FOCUS

VER_everygriff_revolutionary:0 "With Blood On Our Claws"
VER_everygriff_revolutionary_desc:0 "The nobility have used the griffons of Verenia as pawns in their squabble over inheritance for too long. No more! The commongriffs have risen  to fight for themselves. They fight for their freedom and their own ideals, not the whims of distant nobles."
VER_steal_weapons:0 "Now We Will Fight Through"
VER_steal_weapons_desc:0 "The nobility is constantly gathering and stockpiling guns for use in their petty squabbles over inheritance. The revolutionaries, however, need them far more and will gladly take them to liberate themselves from their former masters."
VER_more_militias:0 "They Can't Hold Us"
VER_more_militias_desc:0 "Brave griffons have stepped up and put their lives on the line to start the revolution. They will not be alone. Their willingness to fight and die for a better future for the commongriff will inspire others to stand and fight for their freedom."
VER_crush_the_other_two:0 "No Respite\nUntil We Are Free"
VER_crush_the_other_two_desc:0 "One House has been toppled, but two more still remain. The destruction of one is not enough. The revolution will not stop until every House and reactionary has been cast down and every griffon set free!"
VER_revolutionaries_behind_lines:0 "The Taller They Stand"
VER_revolutionaries_behind_lines_desc:0 "When the revolution began, it was made up entirely of lower-class griffons who endured the brunt of the nobility's squabbling. The recent success of the revolution has stirred up a new resolve within Verenia's burgeoning middle class, inspiring a whole new group of griffons with the ideal of freedom!"
VER_hang_and_burn:0 "The Harder They Fall"
VER_hang_and_burn_desc:0 "Finally, the leading tyrannical houses have been torn down and laid to waste. But they cannot take all of the blame for the suffering of the masses. All members of the nobility share the blame, so they will all share the rope as well."
VER_close_the_economy:0 "Each And Everygriff Starts New"
VER_close_the_economy_desc:0 "For decades, the griffons of Verenia have let distant, unfamiliar figures control them. After finally freeing themselves, why would they leave the economy open to strangers outside of their land? The wealth of Verenia will be controlled by its griffons, as it always should have been.""
VER_verenia_is_free:0 "Can You Feel The New Day Rising"
VER_verenia_is_free_desc:0 "Fighting for something they truly believed in, Verenia's griffons have seized their destiny in their claws. For the first time, they are free to choose for themselves. No matter what comes next, it will be done by the will of free griffons!"

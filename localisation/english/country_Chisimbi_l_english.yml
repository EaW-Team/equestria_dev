chisimbi_unification_wars:0 "Chisimbi Unification Wars"
chisimbi_unification_wars_desc:0 "Even though the Storm King barely touched Chisimbi, he has left his mark on the region. The rise of the self-styled Kaiser Augustus in his wake has led Roam on a conquering spree. The temporary collapse of trade has allowed the slaves of Ibhayiz to rise up against Tzhimaneish masters. Even the Zeblu are looking north after their recent truce with Zongo. With old and new conflicts finally coming to a climax, one thing is certain: there can only be one winner."
IBZ_slave_army_idea:0 "Slave Army"
IBZ_slave_army_idea_desc:0 "Those who fight for Ibhayiz are not conscripts, pressed into service by their government, but slaves rising up against their oppressors. They don’t fight for land or glory, but for their very right to live. Every day, more escaped slaves from territories not yet liberated join the cause, and after every battle, a few more may replace pitchforks with guns."
IBZ_liberation_movement_idea:0 "Liberation Movement"
IBZ_liberation_movement_idea_desc:0 "The cause of the Ibhayiz is clear – to free every last slave in Chisimbi and wider Zebrica. This is the dream Zumoya has declared, and this is the battle cry of the soldiers. Only when the abhorrent practice of slavery has vanished from the continent once and for all may the liberators rest, and all those who suffered shall live together in harmony."
TSV_mercenary_army_idea:0 "Mercenary Army"
TSV_mercenary_army_idea_desc:0 "As the army of Tzhimane lies in ruins, the plutocrats have turned to the only alternative money can buy: mercenaries. Seeing their fortunes threatened by slaves and conquerors, the Mavelas have mobilized the wealth of the nation, in hopes that it can secure them a future to enjoy it."
TSV_entrenched_elite_idea:0 "Entrenched Elite"
TSV_entrenched_elite_idea_desc:0 "Many conquerors have come to Tzhimane, whether llamas, camels, or even a Quaggan war band. They usually don’t last for long, being replaced when the next foreign conqueror or domestic upstart wants to bring the prosperous trade under their control. Over the centuries, the local elites have developed their own way of dealing with whoever comes next. After all, they all need somecreature to administer their lands..."
GFS_griffon_minorities_idea:0 "Griffon Minorities"
GFS_griffon_minorities_idea_desc:0 "When griffons came to Chisimbi over three hundred years ago, most of them landed in Imba-Zaru, and to this day, they are a notable minority in the country. Holding loose contact with the griffons in the South Zebrides, they act as traders, cartographers, mercenaries and miners – the last of which gave them their name, "Kompels"."
GFS_the_six_great_houses_idea:0 "The Six Great Houses"
GFS_the_six_great_houses_idea_desc:0 "Ever since the end of the Azingakundiki dynasty, the rule of Imba-Zaru has been split among six influential families, choosing the Grand Prince among them. Every office has to be carefully balanced between the houses, and every important decision must be made by all six together. This has given Imba-Zaru a very stable political system, though it comes at a cost."
ZLU_great_horde_idea:0 "The Great Horde"
ZLU_great_horde_idea_desc:0 "Two hundred years ago, the Zeblu invaded, pillaged, and devastated Chisimbi, returning home with great riches. In the years since, inter-clan rivalries and the lack of strong leadership have led the Zeblu to only occasionally raid their neighbours, lacking the strength to repeat the feat of their ancestors. But Shaka Khan has reinvigorated the old spirit, and her recent success against Zongo has proven the legend still lives. Once more, the Zeblu horde shall return to Chisimbi, and this time, they are here to stay."
ZLU_clan_structure_idea:0 "Disunited Clan Structure"
ZLU_clan_structure_idea_desc:0 "Shaka Khan has shown great charisma in uniting the various Zeblu clans under her, plastering over old rivalries and unsettled grudges. Yet this unification remains superficial, and quarrels amongst the commanders are all too common. And should at any point the fortune of war turn against her, the loyalty of the clans is sure to disappear again."
GIF_giraffe_slaves:0 "Giraffe Slaves"
GIF_giraffe_slaves_desc:0 "When the hyenas arrived from the west in the 4th century ALB, they found these lands largely uninhabited, save for a few gargoyles or zebras – and the giraffes. Soon enough, the hyenas had conquered the disparate giraffe clans and enslaved them, forcing them to toil on vast plantations established by the settlers. However, the long-necked slaves never have taken their fate for granted, and vast garrisons are needed to enforce their shackles."

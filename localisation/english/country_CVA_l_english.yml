### Ideas ###
CVA_the_fight_for_independence:0 "The War Of Independence"
CVA_the_fight_for_independence_desc:0 "The time has come for Coltva to rise. The struggle before us will be hard, but we must endure. Through rifles and bayonets, we shall conquer our freedom! Death to the Zarcids!"
CVA_the_fight_for_independence_2:0 "The War Of Independence"
CVA_the_fight_for_independence_2_desc:0 "We've been betrayed! The Constitutionalists have proven themselves to be no better than the Zarcid oppressors. For Coltva!"
CVA_monopoly_issue:0 "The Coltvan Monopolists"
CVA_monopoly_issue_desc:0 "Much of the land in Coltva belongs to a small clique of Colthaginian landowners, who are not very enthusiastic about the current rebellion and have a strong power base thanks to their estates. They must be handled swiftly before they can coalesce into a wider movement against us."
CVA_urban_rural_divide:0 "Gerzid Discontent"
CVA_urban_rural_divide_desc:0 "The Colthaginian general Benoam Gerza is fanning the divide between our urban and rural supporters, hoping to unravel our movement from within."
CVA_urban_rural_divide_2:0 "Gerzid Resistance"
CVA_urban_rural_divide_2_desc:0 "A deep chasm has opened within our movement, and it threatens everything we have worked so hard to achieve. We know that Gerza is behind this; we must deal with that treacherous zebra at once!"
CVA_insurrectionary_army:0 "Insurrectionary Army"
CVA_insurrectionary_army_desc:0 "The people of Coltva have arisen to fight against their oppressors! Though volunteers are numerous, many lack any real combat experience aside from the veterans of the insurgency."
CVA_buildup_fishing_industry_idea:0 "Fishers Of the Alaudian Sea"
CVA_buildup_fishing_industry_idea_desc:0 "Our fishing fleets have been rebuilt and their catches will feed the people of Coltva for years to come."
CVA_the_flying_jaguars_idea:0 "The Flying Jaguars"
CVA_the_flying_jaguars_idea_desc:0 "Our pilots may be few in number, but they make up for it with courage and cunning. The enemy will find only death in our skies."
CVA_militia_army:0 "Coltvan Revolutionary Guard"
CVA_militia_army_desc:0 "From the beginning, ours was a fight for Coltva's people, and only through their involvement the LAE can succeed. Our decentralized and flexible chain of command allowed us to keep the Zarcids at bay for years, so why change it? With a few addition, we can adapt this very same method for the wars of the future. "
CVA_elected_officers_idea:0 "Elected Officers"
CVA_elected_officers_idea_desc:0 "Good officers are not born; they're forged on the battlefield. And above all else, their authority must come from the respect of their own soldiers."
CVA_militia_army_2:0 "Coltvan Revolutionary Guard"
CVA_militia_army_2_desc:0 "Some will claim that popular militias are nothing more than a relic of the past. None of them though has ever faced the fury of the Coltvan people, striking and bleeding their army from all sides. The invaders will find a gun behind every blade of grass."
CVA_professional_army:0 "Coltvan People's Army"
CVA_professional_army_desc:0 "Thanks to our continuos efforts, our armed forces have grown into a strong, professional force, its soldiers and officers working together like a well-oiled machine. Coltva is ready to face any threat that the future may throw at us. Our people will never suffer the yoke of foreign occupation."
CVA_actual_officers_idea:0 "Modern Officer Training Methods"
CVA_actual_officers_idea_desc:0 "War changes, and quickly too. Our training methods must keep pace with it if we want our officer corps to remain top-notch."
CVA_professional_army_2:0 "Coltvan People's Army"
CVA_professional_army_2_desc:0 "We've come a long way from the scattered group of rebels hiding and fighting in the countryside. Our armed forces are now a disciplined, well-drilled organization, capable to hold its own against the greater powers of the region."
CVA_partisan_legacy_idea:0 "Guerrilla Legacy"
CVA_partisan_legacy_idea_desc:0 "The history of our armed forces didn't start with proud warriors in shining armours, but with mud-covered peasant militias lurking silently amongst the jungle's foliage. We might have come a long way, but the usefulness of those methods doesn't diminish with time."
CVA_feed_the_people_idea:0 "Food Crop Proliferation"
CVA_feed_the_people_idea_desc:0 "The well being of our people takes precedence on anything else. Stallions and mares, elders and foals; Coltvans will not go hungry under our watch."
CVA_feed_the_people_idea_2:0 "Food Crop Proliferation"
CVA_feed_the_people_idea_2_desc:0 "Widespread mechanization in our farming industry has made sure that famines will only be a fading memory of the past."
CVA_develop_coffee_fields_idea:0 "Cash Crop Proliferation"
CVA_develop_coffee_fields_idea_desc:0 "Now that most of our farmers and peasants have taken back possession of their land, they can enjoy the revenues that come with that, instead of fattening the pockets of some patrician."
CVA_develop_coffee_fields_idea_2:0 "Cash Crop Proliferation"
CVA_develop_coffee_fields_idea_2_desc:0 "Widespread mechanization allows products such as coffee and tobacco to reach foreign shores in quantities never seen before."
CVA_develop_silver_mines_idea:0 "Rivers Of Silver"
CVA_develop_silver_mines_idea_desc:0 "It might not be shining gold, but it's still valuable and, most important, it's plentiful."
CVA_major_development_idea:0 "Economic Shock Therapy"
CVA_major_development_idea_desc:0 "The decades spent under Colthage's domination have prevented the formation of a true industrial sector in Coltva. Therefore, we must force-march our way into modernity. It won't be painless, but it is necessary."
CVA_follow_through_with_our_promises_idea:0 "The Plan Of Kizil-Zeb"
CVA_follow_through_with_our_promises_idea_desc:0 "As detailed in the Plan of Kizil-Zeb, the land once belonging to the Colthaginians landowners will be confiscated. From there, we will be examining the claims of the ancient villages, redistribute the land accordingly, and deliver monetary compensation for the landowners. Those still present, that is."
CVA_deradicalise_the_LAE_idea:0 "Good Monday Agreement"
CVA_deradicalise_the_LAE_idea_desc:0 "A final treaty of peaceful coexistence with Colthage has been signed, securing Coltva's future as an independent entity."
CVA_really_modern_labour_laws_idea:0 "Ozidian Social Security"
CVA_really_modern_labour_laws_idea_desc:0 "Through a substantial and comprehensive body of laws, the rights of the Coltvan working class are assured."
CVA_autonomous_regions_idea:0 "Agrarian Communalism"
CVA_autonomous_regions_idea_desc:0 "The cornerstone of Coltvan society is, and has always been, the rural village. They will take care of their own affairs without overbearing government presence."
CVA_the_principle_of_federalisation_idea:0 "Macawian Constitutionalism"
CVA_the_principle_of_federalisation_idea_desc:0 "Macawia offers a shining model of democracy to all Northern Zebrica. Some of its elements may be introduced into our new constitution as well. Copying is, after all, the sincerest form of flattery."
CVA_CTH_building_navy:0 "Refitting the Fleet"
CVA_CTH_building_navy_desc:0 "Resources may be limited at the moment, but a small flotilla of armed and armoured ships will keep our shores safe for the time being."
CVA_CTH_building_navy_2:0 "Refitting the Fleet"
CVA_CTH_building_navy_2_desc:0 "Resources may be limited at the moment, but a small flotilla of armed and armoured ships will keep our shores safe for the time being."

### Focuses ###
CVA_the_revolution_has_begun:0 "The Coltvan Revolution"
CVA_the_revolution_has_begun_desc:0 "After years of struggle, we have finally taken the first step to liberating Coltva from oppression. To arms, farmers and workers of Coltva! We shall defend our autonomy to the last breath!"
CVA_the_end_of_the_junta:0 "The End Of the Revolutionary Junta"
CVA_the_end_of_the_junta_desc:0 "While the revolutionary junta allowed us to fight our long struggle, we have no intention of running a military regime like the Zarcids did. With our autonomy secured, we can begin transitioning to a civilian government."
CVA_follow_through_with_our_promises:0 "Follow Through With The Plan Of Kizil-Zeb"
CVA_follow_through_with_our_promises_desc:0 "Our promises to the people of Coltva outlined in the Kizil-Zeb Plan represent our core commitments, and we must uphold them. We will break the oligarchs who have exploited us for so long, and the wealth they took from the people will be returned to the people."
CVA_nozebra_left_behind:0 "Not A Soul Left Behind"
CVA_nozebra_left_behind_desc:0 "How many thinkers, scientists, poets, and leaders lie dormant in Coltva, subdued by the chains of illiteracy and a neglected education system? One is too many. We must make large investments in education to free our people from intellectual poverty."
CVA_support_urban_development:0 "Cooperate With Urban Intellectual Circles"
CVA_support_urban_development_desc:0 "While the core of our movement arose out of the rural peasantry, we have always had many sympathisers among the urban intelligentsia. These new comrades will prove invaluable in governing our nation, as even a decentralised republic needs bureaucrats."
CVA_neuter_zarza:0 "Give The Butcher His Due"
CVA_neuter_zarza_desc:0 "Benoam Gerza has been undermining us from the beginning, sowing doubt and inciting sabotage among the urbanites who were sceptical of our revolution. He has no interest in honest politics, and would rather see us reconquered by the Zarcids so he can rule as one of their political chiefs. We have more than enough evidence to have him arrested and tried; we need only act swiftly and see it done."
CVA_immortalise_the_revolution:0 "The Immortal Revolution"
CVA_immortalise_the_revolution_desc:0 "Thousands dead; farmlands devastated; widespread suffering and misery. The price of Coltva's independence was harsh, and we will never forget the sacrifices necessary to achieve it, nor the countless heroes and martyrs that shed their blood for a righteous cause. Our people shall remember them for generations to come."
CVA_deradicalise_the_LAE:0 "The Good Monday Agreement"
CVA_deradicalise_the_LAE_desc:0 "The fighting is over; our oppressors have been defeated. Now we must move together and build a brighter tomorrow, rather than eternally avenging the injustices of yesterday. We will sit down with our humbled former enemies and draft a binding agreement to ensure a lasting peace."
CVA_really_modern_labour_laws:0 "Protect the Coltvan Working Class"
CVA_really_modern_labour_laws_desc:0 "The oligarchs exploited the workers through uneven laws in some areas, but in others they exploited us through the lack of laws. Ozid has proposed a robust set of labour protections so that every Coltvan will enjoy decent, meaningful work and just wages."
CVA_promote_free_trade:0 "Encourage Free Trade"
CVA_promote_free_trade_desc:0 "We have no desire to seek autarky. Indeed, it would be foolish to try in a nation as small as ours. We will forge strong trade relations with other nations to bring in new goods and improve the lives of our people."
CVA_autonomous_regions:0 "Rural Autonomism"
CVA_autonomous_regions_desc:0 "We have always held that the peasant can be trusted to govern their own community: our entire revolution was predicated on that trust we put in the common zebra. Now that the situation has stabilised, we will devolve significant autonomy to local peasant communities."
CVA_the_principle_of_federalisation:0 "Adopt The Macawian Model"
CVA_the_principle_of_federalisation_desc:0 "Without the pen, the sword would be raised in vain. We will secure the freedoms we fought so hard for by drafting a new constitution, modelled not on the oligarchic constitution of Colthage, but on that of Macawia, which has always stood as a beacon of democracy."
CVA_unban_conservative_parties:0 "The Dual Constitution System"
CVA_unban_conservative_parties_desc:0 "There is no doubt it was the peasants and workers of Coltva that broke the back of the Zarcid regime. To recognize their merits and enshrine our newly-found autonomy, we've approached the new government back in Colthage with a proposition. A Dual Constitution will ensure that the concentration of power done by the Zarcids in the past will remain there, hopefully forever."
CVA_finish_the_liberation:0 "Continue The War Of Liberation"
CVA_finish_the_liberation_desc:0 "Many years ago, after the Storm King defeat and the chaos that ensued, some of our neighbours took advantage of our weakness. Now, we're finally in a position to avenge that injustice. Coltva shall go to war one last time, not to conquer, but to free our brethren on the other side of the border."

CVA_stick_to_the_plan:0 "Implement Land Reform"
CVA_stick_to_the_plan_desc:0 "Land reform was one of our key promises to the peasantry. We will seize land from the oligarchs who have oppressed our people for so long, and set up tribunals to determine historical land claims so that the land will be returned to its rightful owners. Then we will take one third of the land owned by the conglomerates, and give it back to those farmers who toil upon it."
CVA_begin_primitive_industrialisation:0 "Primitive Industrialisation"
CVA_begin_primitive_industrialisation_desc:0 "Colthaginian rule has done little to improve the industrial sector of long-neglected Coltva. While we will not attempt to replicate the crash-industrialization of Stalliongrad, we will begin importing machinery and training our workers in modern industrial methods."
CVA_develop_steel_milling:0 "The Coltartan Steel Mills"
CVA_develop_steel_milling_desc:0 "Steel production is a key component of military and civilian industry alike. We will construct a vast steel mill just outside Kizil-Zeb to kickstart this vital industry."
CVA_basic_heavy_industry:0 "Subsidise Heavy Industry"
CVA_basic_heavy_industry_desc:0 "The primary purpose of the economy is to serve and provide for the people, but part of that is securing them from those who would subjugate us. We cannot always make butter: sometimes, we must make guns."
CVA_bauxite_mineing:0 "Expand The Qeshaym Bauxite Mines"
CVA_bauxite_mineing_desc:0 "Aluminum is vital for establishing advanced industries, and it fetches an excellent price on the global market. We have discovered a large source of Bauxite in the jungles around Qeshaym, long left underexploited due to squabbles among landowners. With those landowners gone, we can now properly tap into this mineral wealth."
CVA_develop_silver_mines:0 "The Silver Of Coltva"
CVA_develop_silver_mines_desc:0 "For some time, the vast silver deposits of Coltva were used to line the pockets of Zarcid allies as part of their patronage networks. Now that this silver is under our control, we will sell it abroad to get the necessary cash influx to kickstart our economy. We must not grow overly dependent on this revenue source however: we are a nation for the workers, not a clique of silver barons."
CVA_connecting_coltva:0 "The Coltartan-Maneake-Marelaka Railway"
CVA_connecting_coltva_desc:0 "Our inland communities are connected by rivers, gravel roads and the occasional stone bridge. If we are to transport our goods and fully connect our nation, we should build railroads in between the cities of the highlands."
CVA_major_development:0 "Economic Shock Therapy"
CVA_major_development_desc:0 "In order to secure our economic wellbeing, we need to make massive investments in new factories, railroads, everything. For the next year, we will pour our efforts into building a modern industrial sector so that our army may be equipped with modern weaponry and our people may enjoy the comforts of modern life, even out into the most rustic countryside towns."
CVA_foreign_experts:0 "Import Foreign Industrial Experts"
CVA_foreign_experts_desc:0 "While we have some local experts, our burgeoning industrial sector requires more expertise than we currently have. We will offer generous salaries and prestigious positions to foreign architects, engineers, metallurgists, and industrial scientists who come to work here. They will train a new generation of Coltvan workers in the most modern industrial methods, and soon we will be the ones other nations look to for expertise."
CVA_textile_industry:0 "Support The Textile Industry"
CVA_textile_industry_desc:0 "Our textile industry has always been fairly strong, but we should further support this basic industry to provide jobs for our people and drive down the cost of clothing."
CVA_plantations_for_the_people:0 "Plantations For The People"
CVA_plantations_for_the_people_desc:0 "We are a revolution of farmers and peasants. To benefit that class which helped us the most, we build new plantations, worked and managed by the farmers themselves. These will not be like the monoculture plantations favoured by capitalists and uncaring bureaucrats: we will rely on local knowledge and crop rotation to ensure the soil remains fertile for generations to come."
CVA_increase_industrial_mobilisation:0 "Mobilise The Economy"
CVA_increase_industrial_mobilisation_desc:0 "Fighting a conventional war for the first time, the REA has found itself running low on ammunition and supplies. We must seize control of key factories and gear them towards wartime production if we are to win our freedom."
CVA_feed_the_people:0 "Cassava, Sorghum And Maize"
CVA_feed_the_people_desc:0 "Our primary concern must be feeding our people. By focusing our plantations on growing staple crops, we can ensure food is always cheap and readily available, so that our people always enjoy plentiful, nutritious food even in times of hardship."
CVA_develop_coffee_fields:0 "Coffee And Tobacco"
CVA_develop_coffee_fields_desc:0 "By focusing our plantations on cash crops, we can get a much-needed export to bring money into Coltva, which we can then reinvest in improving the lives of our people in a myriad ways. Additionally, the cooperative nature of our plantations means that the farmers themselves will take home a great deal of the profits from these cash crops."
CVA_develop_the_rubber_fields:0 "Rebuild The Rubber Plantations"
CVA_develop_the_rubber_fields_desc:0 "Our jungles contain many rubber trees which could be easily exploited to benefit our people, but thus far have remained underdeveloped. We will invest into starting a rubber industry, both for export and for domestic use."
CVA_develop_the_sugar:0 "Sugar And Rum"
CVA_develop_the_sugar_desc:0 "Some of the farmers on the new plantations have approached us, saying that introducing sugarcane into their existing crop rotation scheme will provide a valuable cash crop while not degrading the soil conditions. Several of the villages around these plantations have also expressed interest in setting up local distilleries once the sugar crop starts to come in, so that they can start up a rum industry which would bring money into these villages and prove a valuable export. We should encourage these developments."
CVA_mechanisation:0 "Agricultural Mechanisation"
CVA_mechanisation_desc:0 "We have sometimes been characterised as primitivists, or as anti-industry, but this is not so. We can and will integrate modern tools into our traditional agricultural methods. This way, we can gain the benefits of mechanised agriculture without falling prey to the unsustainability which others have embraced so carelessly."
CVA_improve_specialisation:0 "Let The Crops Flow"
CVA_improve_specialisation_desc:0 "Our agricultural expansions have borne fruit. Our common farmers are better fed and better paid than ever before. They take pride in their work and their land, and dutifully steward the soil for the next generation. Our children will grow up tall and strong, never knowing the stunting effects of lean years or the burning ache of hunger."
CVA_the_chocolate_industry:0 "The Zeirutid Chocolate"
CVA_the_chocolate_industry_desc:0 "Setting up our new plantations has had an unexpected benefit: between the sugar we're now growing and the cacao beans we have always harvested from the jungles, Coltva has become home to a booming chocolate industry. Encouraging this growth will both provide us with another valuable export and a delicious addition to our army rations."

CVA_the_army:0 "The Liberation Army Of The East"
CVA_the_army_desc:0 "The LAE has been fighting against our overlords for many years. Between us, we already have a great deal of knowledge of how to fight effectively and efficiently; we merely need to pool that knowledge together to create a doctrine."
CVA_smuggle_in_rifles:0 "Every Rifle Helps"
CVA_smuggle_in_rifles_desc:0 "When we took over the cities of Coltva, the Zarcid forces did not withdraw in an orderly fashion. If we comb through local records, we can doubtless find numerous weapon caches and armouries which they weren't able to empty before we arrived, and turn their contents on their former owners."
CVA_local_arms_manufacturing:0 "Local Rifle Manufactures"
CVA_local_arms_manufacturing_desc:0 "For centuries, we zebras have practiced small-scale metallurgy and weaponsmithing. Although centralised weapon manufactories are more efficient, given our present circumstances we have to rely on this tradition of local gunsmiths to bolster our weapon and ammunition supplies."
CVA_standardise_rifles:0 "Adopt The Garcano"
CVA_standardise_rifles_desc:0 "The reality is, we have no single service rifle. The LAE is a disparate force of peasants and workers, bringing what weapons they could to the struggle when they felt they had no choice but to take up arms. Still, officially adopting the Garcano rifle as our standard service rifle will streamline the process of manufacturing new weapons and equipping new units, although it could be many years before our soldiers' kits are standardised in practice."
CVA_zaboula_academy:0 "Found The Marelaka Military Academy"
CVA_zaboula_academy_desc:0 "We should gather our finest military minds together into an academy, both to train new officers and to pool together our accumulated knowledge so that we will make new breakthroughs in military doctrine, science and technology."
CVA_support_battalions:0 "Field Support Battalions"
CVA_support_battalions_desc:0 "An army doesn't just need riflezeebs. We need medics, messengers, scouts, and a myriad other support staff to wage war on the modern battlefield. Although during our days as a guerrilla force, each unit had to be self-sufficient, we are now in a position to put these specialist troops into dedicated support battalions to assist our forces on a larger scale."
CVA_liberation_artillery:0 "The Cannons Of Liberation"
CVA_liberation_artillery_desc:0 "No longer constrained by what individual zebras can carry on our backs and hide in our jungle encampments, we can begin rolling out cannons, howitzers and heavy mortars to support our infantry."
CVA_raise_the_militias:0 "Stir the Peasants"
CVA_raise_the_militias_desc:0 "Though our enemies branded us as traitors and bandits, we the LAE have always been popular among the downtrodden of Coltva, with our leaders akin to folk heroes. Already, we've seen volunteers flooding into our hastily-set-up recruitment offices, wanting to join our struggle. We should send officers out into the countryside to arm, train, and organise these enthusiastic zebras into new units."
CVA_jungle_training:0 "From the Jungles We Came"
CVA_jungle_training_desc:0 "Identify the target, strike when the enemy is distracted, fade into the jungle, ambush the troops they send after us. That is how we have waged our struggle for many years, and the Zarcids have never been able to match us as jungle fighters. We will adapt this experiential knowledge to our current larger-scale conflict, to ensure our enemies always fear the jungle."
CVA_foreign_volunteers:0 "Kásan Volunteers"
CVA_foreign_volunteers_desc:0 "Centuries ago, a ship of slaves revolted against their Colthaginian captors and landed on the shores of Griffonia, founding the Kása Free State as a haven for all those fleeing bondage. Now the descendants of those same slaves have returned, not for vengeance, but to join us in our fight for justice. We welcome our long-lost siblings into the struggle, and swear to resist oppression with the same zeal they have!"
CVA_fighter_fleet:0 "Convert the Crop Dusters"
CVA_fighter_fleet_desc:0 "We do not have an aircraft industry, but a few of the landlords left behind old crop duster planes they had brought in from elsewhere when they fled our advance. With a few modifications, these could serve as our first wing of fighter planes."
CVA_basic_bombers:0 "Improvised Bombers"
CVA_basic_bombers_desc:0 "While we may not have dedicated bomber aircraft, there is nothing stopping us from jury-rigging civilian planes to serve as bombers. While we may not be able to match a proper airforce, a few barrel-bombs dropped on enemy formations should make our foes think twice before advancing out in the open."
CVA_develop_a_doctrine:0 "The Liberation Air Fleet"
CVA_develop_a_doctrine_desc:0 "Our aviators are few in number, but they have each flown dozens of missions. We will gather them together and formalize their chain of command into a proper airforce, so that as we expand our wings that knowledge gets disseminated among new generations of pilots."
CVA_the_flying_jaguars:0 "The Flying Jaguars"
CVA_the_flying_jaguars_desc:0 "The Jaguar can wait in hiding for hours on end, then leap and catch its prey out of the air, dragging it back to earth. Our fighter wings shall emulate this ambush strategy, hiding in the clouds and striking enemy bomber formations from every angle before returning to the safety of our airbases and flak guns."
CVA_close_range_support:0 "Combined Arms Tactics"
CVA_close_range_support_desc:0 "Now that we have a proper airforce, we should develop new, lighter bomber planes which can deliver munitions more precisely to support our infantry in combat. We will also train our radiozeebs and artillery spotters in how and when to call down such precision airstrikes, to maximize damage and minimize the chance of losing planes or friendly fire."
CVA_defenders_of_the_homeland:0 "Defenders of the Homeland"
CVA_defenders_of_the_homeland_desc:0 "Now that we have formalised the LAE's practices, acquired weapons and integrated the volunteers, we are ready to begin full-scale military expansion and reorganization. The LAE will defend our homes and our people no matter the enemy's ferocity."
CVA_stick_to_the_militias:0 "Reform the Militias"
CVA_stick_to_the_militias_desc:0 "The militia system has served us well throughout our long struggle. While much work must be done to expand the system to administer a modern fighting force of our new size, the essentially decentralised nature of the system will foster low-echelon initiative backed up by the fighting spirit of zebras fighting for their homes alongside their friends and neighbours."
CVA_elected_officers:0 "Elected Officers"
CVA_elected_officers_desc:0 "Our officers should be chosen from among their units. This will foster a closeness between the enlisted zebras and their leaders, quite different from the callous disregard for their soldiers engendered by more aristocratic officer traditions. We trust that zebras who fight and die alongside one another will know who best to lead them better than some distant pencil-pushers."
CVA_autonomous_recruiting:0 "Localised Recruiting"
CVA_autonomous_recruiting_desc:0 "A village is like a large family, and so is a platoon. We will set up recruitment and conscription offices out in the furthest villages, and structure our training and deployment procedures such that our troops will always fight alongside the friends and neighbours they fight for."
CVA_professionalism:0 "Professionalise The LAE"
CVA_professionalism_desc:0 "While the decentralized militia model has many advantages, it simply is insufficient to the kind of large-scale conventional warfare we are likely to face now that we have liberated Coltva. We must create a disciplined, regimented force of professional soldiers who will stick to the plans conceived by a centralized high command."
CVA_actual_officers:0 "Modern Officer Training Methods"
CVA_actual_officers_desc:0 "We will invite foreign instructors to cooperate with the hardened veterans of the LAE to train a new generation of officers, so that our army will always have effective and innovative commanders guided by both modern military theory and the LAE's hard experience."
CVA_proper_discipline:0 "A Will Of Iron, And A Heart Of Steel"
CVA_proper_discipline_desc:0 "As appealing as the romantic ideal of the passionate peasant-soldier is, they simply cannot stand up to the modern battlefield. Our officers and our soldiers must be stoic, unyielding, and unquestioning in their execution of their orders. They cannot be clouded by doubt, and must be guided by duty and service rather than pride, passion, or personal motives."
CVA_hill_warriors:0 "Warriors Of The Hills"
CVA_hill_warriors_desc:0 "In another army, "Run to the hills!" is the cry of defeat. For us it is a cunning feint. We will train our soldiers in fighting in the rugged highlands of our country, learning to navigate and exploit every crevice and ridge to ambush, harry and exhaust our foe before delivering the coup de grace."
CVA_limited_motorisation:0 "Incorporate Motorised Units"
CVA_limited_motorisation_desc:0 "While motorized units may not be particularly effective in the hills and jungles, their mobility particularly in flat terrain cannot be overstated. We should incorporate these units and corresponding tactics into our forces in order to better achieve victory on the modern battlefield."
CVA_partisan_legacy:0 "A Legacy Of Struggle"
CVA_partisan_legacy_desc:0 "The LAE has gone from a ragtag band of rebels into a formidable modern fighting force. But we must never forget our roots, and never become the domineering, imperialistic organization so many other armies have become. With every new generation, we will impress upon our soldiers the meaning of their service, and the legacy they must uphold."

CVA_the_navy:0 "Look To The Sea"
CVA_the_navy_desc:0 "For centuries, the Colthaginians would transport slaves across the sea in ships of misery. At the same time, heroic tales abound of pirates raiding these ships and freeing these slaves. If we are to get our goods to the world market and disrupt the lifelines of our enemies, we need to found a proper navy to contest the Colthaginian dominance of the seas."
CVA_repurpose_fishing_ships:0 "Repurpose The Fishing Ships"
CVA_repurpose_fishing_ships_desc:0 "Some of our larger fishing ships can be repurposed to serve as convoys and auxiliary military ships. A temporary solution, at best, until the naval yards can be put back into service with workers and material, but it will suffice for the time being."
CVA_build_up_the_shipyards:0 "Build Up The Horsemuz Shipyards"
CVA_build_up_the_shipyards_desc:0 "In order to compete with our neighbours, we will have to encourage a major expansion of our shipyards and drydocks. Only that way can we adequately inherit the vastness of Colthage's naval tradition."
CVA_buildup_fishing_industry:0 "Protect The Fisheries"
CVA_buildup_fishing_industry_desc:0 "Our enemies are ruthless. We cannot assume they will restrict themselves to targetting military vessels and those carrying war materiel; if we let them they will torpedo even fishing vessels to starve us out and spread fear. Outfitting destroyers is therefore not only necessary to protect our industry, but also our people."
CVA_seize_colthage_ships:0 "Repurpose Mothballed Colthaginian Ships"

The call of revolution has arrived in Coltva, and [CVA.GetLeader] has emerged from hiding to answer it.\n\nRevealing themselves in the center of Kizil-Zeb along with their top general Ozid, the LAE members among the city's population joined them and quickly drove the Colthaginian garrison out of the city. When the fort at the top of the great hill was taken, a new banner was raised. The red horseshoe of the farmer over a yellow banner of hope.\n\nColtva has stood up, and they will not kneel again without bloodshed."

zebra_zapata.2.t:0 "A Promise Kept"
zebra_zapata.2.d:0 "For the longest time, Coltva's vast farmlands were the domain of a small number of landowners who, with the complicity of the Zarcids regime, extended their domain and stole the land that gave sustenance to countless Coltvans and their families. As a result, the communal lands that had been tended for centuries by the self-management of local villages were swallowed - either by force or law - by the larger estates, their farmers turned to nothing more than wage labour for the landowners.\n\nThis sad state of affairs shall go on no longer. One of the main points of the Kizil-Zeb Plan had always been the redistribution of the stolen land and, now that the Zarcids' hold on Coltva had been shattered for good, Zeshmunazash had full intention of delivering on this promise as soon as possible.\n\nIn many cases, the process was quite simple and straightforward; where the landowners had already fled, either willingly or not, the farmers themselves had proceeded to tear down the enclosures and reoccupied their lands. In other places though, violent and merciless retribution occurred.\n\nThankfully those were rare cases, and violence was avoided most of the time, the new government quickly negotiating adequate compensation with the remaining landowners. As the support from Colthage had evaporated nearly overnight, there weren't many remaining options for them.\n\nSome creatures may call such policies radical, an assault on private property, perhaps. For Zeshmunazash though, they were nothing more than the righting of an ancient wrong, as the fruits of labour have returned to Coltva's farmers." #AAAAAAH

The approach was a predictable one, sneaking amongst barren hills of rocks and old trees; the LAE knew of it, and thus was waiting for them.\n\nZillos rose tentatively from his foxhole just as he finished the last checks on the machine-gun. It was an old model, pilfered from a Zarcid armoury somewhere, but it would do its job. There was another zebra by his side, acting as impromptu loader. Zillos didn't remember her exact name. Zada? Zeda? Something like that probably. He couldn't even recall where she was from, but that didn't matter right now. Wherever each of them heralded from was inconsequential; they were soldiers of the Liberation Army of the East, just like the other fifty zebras occupying scattered foxholes along the hilltop.\n\n"Here they come," he heard her mutter, and Zillos nodded grimly. So, it would come to this, uh? Revolutionaries against revolutionaries. The new government in Colthage had clearly shed all pretence of 'reconciliation' and 'understanding'. It seemed like the precedent system imposed upon Coltva was bad only because the Zarcids were in charge, instead of them.\n\nDid the Constitutionalists seriously think they could arm the people to fight their war for them, and then just take them back?\n\nZillos pulled at the weapon's charge handle hard, and was greeted by a satisfying metallic clank. The first enemy units had already begun emerging from behind a nearby hill. They moved in a lose marching formation; they clearly expected trouble at any moment, and they were right.\n\nZillos shifted the aim of the water-cooled gun toward those further in the back. He exhaled, and then finally pull the trigger.

His voice was no longer a voice. It was a roar, filled with raging fury and deep sorrow in equal measure. A cry of anguish against an unfair world.\n\n"I've told him. I've told him!" he repeated, fighting to keep back tears as he read the dispatch for the fourth time. "I've told him those damn Constitutionalists were not to be trusted. I've told him that they were no better than the Zarcids. He should have listened. Why didn't he listen?!"\n\nNone of the zebras present in the room said anything. It was a rhetorical question and, even if it wasn't, none had a sure answer. Maybe Zeshmunazash truly thought that the independence of Coltva could be assured without more bloodshed, that the Constitutionalists would be different from the lackey of the Zarcids. Whatever the reason was, it had died with Zeshmunazash, treacherously murdered by Colthaginian soldiers.\n\n"What now, then?" Jazelid inquired, being the first to break the silence. Ozid drew a deep breath, then shook his head.\n\n"I want all of our forces mobilized. Every stallion and mare, every weapon we have, I want them ready for the campaign. We're marching west and we're not stopping until I see that forsaken city burned to the bloody ground!"\n\nThere was some hesitation at first, but eventually all members of the LAE General Staff nodded their approval, some more eagerly than other.\n\n"And another thing," Ozid said just as they made to rise from their chairs.

A Coltvan himself, he had abandoned his roots and pledged loyalty to the Zarcids regime for personal gain. His hooves were soaked with the blood of LAE members, as well as innocent civilians caught in the middle of violent reprisals. Unfortunately, the latter far outnumbered the former.\n\nThus, it was no surprise that the new government in Colthage had been more than eager to get rid of such a controversial figure, quickly disgracing and then extraditing him to Coltva as a sign of good will, so that he could be tried under the laws of his birthplace.\n\nUnfortunately, it appears that we have miscalculated.\n\nWhile the Coltvan peasantry, the workers in the cities, and the entirety of the LAE is more than glad that such a butcher will finally face justice, the reaction from the middle and upper-middle class has been the exact opposite, decrying the action of our government as "petty vengeance". Wild rumours already flood the halls of the intelligentsia, claiming that Benoam Gerza will be put to death as a member of a wealthy and influential family, and that this is but the beginning of a "Marksist purge" from the LAE.\n\nGerza seems to be aware of this, and he's without a doubt fanning the discontent so to save his own hide. As much as we would all find delight in putting him before a firing squad, the backlash would surely be the undoing of our still young republic. Gerza will live, at least for now." #AAAAAAH

It had all happened so fast she could hardly process it, but there it was, in black-and-white: she was getting compensated for the land the rebels had taken from her, and the amount was enough that her family would be rich zebras once again.\n\nAnza had feared for her life when the Zeirudtistas had taken over Coltva, and when her land was confiscated she'd almost been ready to flee, and damn their promises that she would be compensated "when the crisis was over". But today, they'd kept their promise. Her old tenets showed up to the tribunal, one by one, telling their stories of how fair she'd been, how she'd always kept the rents low, how she'd forgiven their debts in the lean years. The three zebras making up her village tribunal had deliberated, reviewed documents about historical land claims, and when they'd come to their decision Anza was sure she'd misheard: she was to be paid the full value of the land, and then some.\n\nShe wouldn't get the land back; the age of large landlords was over and it wouldn't even be profitable at this point, but she had enough to invest in the growing industrial sector, or start a business, or whatever she wanted to do! Her foals would grow up affluent, no, they would grow up rich!

His family possession had been gathered in the middle, so to be unpacked later, but they were so pitifully few that they just made the room look bigger by comparison.\n\nIt felt like yesterday that Zillos had been leading forty poorly-armed but well-motivated zebras deep in the Coltvan countryside, sleeping in a shed belonging to a sympathetic farmer during the day, and assaulting Colthaginians patrol at night. And look at him now; donning some proper clothes - with a tie! - and ready to soon begin his work as a party official in Kizil-Zeb. And with new responsibilities came a new home, apparently.\n\nThe zebra shot another glance around, taking one final stock of his surroundings. Their new apartment wasn't even that big for city's standards, and yet Zillos doubted they would ever fully furnish it. Things had been simpler when he was young; a small village had been where he had grown up his entire life, just like his dad and grandpa. Even when the call of the LAE had reached him and a small group of friends, they had picked up their rifles to fight for freedom, yes, but mostly to protect their villages from the rapacious landlords. And now he had left all of that behind.\n\nSomething brushed his side, and Zillos felt a soft kiss on his neck.\n\n"Everything's alright, honey?" his wife Zel asked with a small hint of worry. "You've been standing there for a while now."\n\nZillos shook his head, letting out a soft chuckle. Zel's steps were always so quiet, as if she walked on the tip of her hooves. He wrapped a foreleg over her shoulder and gave her a gentle kiss on the cheek. Her mane had a soft cinnamon aroma, just like the first day they had met.\n\n"Nothing important, dear," Zillos said.

Even though many LAE supporters argued that the disgraced general deserved nothing but a firing squad - the same courtesy he had granted time and time again to his victims - president Ozid was unmovable on the subject. Gerza would have his fair trial.\n\nAnd quite the trial it turned out to be. The prosecution spent the months prior accumulating evidence and witnesses, hiring specialists to scour the newly opened archives of the old Zarcids regime and bringing forth old accounts.\n\nThe day of the trial, the mole of evidence brought forth was thorough, massive and, for many Coltvan citizens, deeply unnerving. Gerza had not only directly taken part in countless and willing reprisals against the people of Coltva, both young and elder witnesses coming forth to give chilling accounts of the atrocities committed by his troops, but he had also participated in a system of extortion and corruption involving criminal cartels and local landowners. His own loyalty to the Zarcids turned out to be nothing more than a cover to line up his own pockets, as the registers brought from Colthage described everything from embezzlement of state funds to constant bribery of public officials.\n\nBefore such undeniable proof, even those who had shown a modicum of compassion towards the disgraced general turned their backs on him in disgust, while the wider general public demanded blood.\n\nAs the presiding judge brought the gavel down, Benoam Gerza was found guilty of all charges levelled against him. However, the newly established Code of Law did not contemplate a death sentence; Gerza would therefore spend the rest of his life in maximum security prison, forever away from the public eye, and without the chance of parole.\n\nNot exactly the end many were hoping for the butcher, but at least now Coltva as a whole can sigh in relief, knowing that justice for all his victims has finally been delivered." #AAAAAAH

His only consolation at the moment was the fact that the local mayor was taking her sweet time with her introductory speech.\n\n"I see now why you've chosen to retire," he muttered under his breath.\n\nBy his side, Zeshmunazash smirked. "Of course. I knew there would be a lot of talking to do once in office. So, knowing how much you love showing off your skills as an orator, I decided to just leave the honour to you."\n\nOzid shook his head, though there was an amused smile on his lips. "Ah yes. Very sensible of you." He paused. "I still think you should be here though. In my place, I mean. We won thanks to your leadership, after all."\n\n"We won because the peasants choose to fight for justice." Zeshmunazash simply shrugged. "And our program is now being implemented. That's the only important matter." He grinned again. "Besides, we can't have a dangerous outlaw soiling the dignity of the presidential office, now can we?"\n\n"You could have at least put forth your candidacy though."\n\nThe zebra shook his head. "And won overwhelmingly the popular vote too. I'd rather avoid a repeat of the last Zarcid's election."\n\n"Fair. Though I think you would have looked pretty fine with the whole Zonician aesthetic."\n\nZeshmunazash let out a snicker, mirrored shortly after by Ozid. Then came the thunderous applause from the plaza as the local mayor finally ended her speech and presented the two guests of honour.\n\n"I guess it's time then," Ozid noted as they both got up from their seats and made their way towards the speaker's podium. He reached inside his jacket, and found some comfort as he felt his speech's notes still there in the inside pocket.\n\nHe gave Zeshmunazash a grateful grin.

What was unusual however, was the fact that this one would not only include the civilian staff as well, but also be held at Kizil-Zeb's public theatre, for the simple fact it was the only building spacious enough to hold all delegates.\n\nA thunderous applause greeted Zeshmunazash as he stepped on the speaker's podium, and the zebra grinned as he gazed upon the gathered crowd of delegates and supporters.\n\n"Brothers and sisters," he began. "I'm pleased that so many of you decided to come here, just as I am to see so many new faces amongst our ranks. But I'll speak plainly now; I've called upon you today for I wish to propose a new resolution, one that will be voted by all the delegates present here." He paused, then went on, "I therefore propose the dissolution of the Liberation Army of the East."\n\nThe effect was more or less what he was expecting, as the entire hall fell ominously quiet.\n\n"I understand how my proposal probably sounds to most of you, and I can assure you than no, Zeshmunazash Zeirutid has not gone crazy." That earned a few, if weak, chuckles from the audience.\n\n"When the LAE was born, it had one simple objective, that being the liberation of Coltva. The objective has been achieved, but new challenges have arisen now. Challenges that the LAE in its current form simply cannot deal with, for it was created, first and foremost, as an army. And of what use are bayonets and rifles when our enemies are no longer the Zarcids, but illiteracy and poverty?"\n\n"Coltva has entered in a new phase of her history, and so must the LAE. Thought its end saddens me considerably, I do not despair, for I know that its spirit burns with unmatched intensity in the hearts of each zebra present today. The LAE fought against injustice and for liberty from its conception; I ask you to keep those ideals close to your hearts and maintain the flame of that very determination burning, no matter under what banner you find yourself under."\n\nThe mood seemed to lighten as he went on. Maybe a few were even started agreeing with what he was saying.\n\n"It is therefore with pride that I announce today the creation of the Coltvan People's Agrarian Party. Our armed struggle might be over, but the political one has just begun."\n\nThe following applause was not the one that had initially greeted him, thought it was considerably bigger than the one Zeshmunazash had expected.

"Zoberto is looking for volunteers for wood gathering duty tomorrow. Me and Zamuel already signed up. You with us?"\n\n"Not tomorrow, sorry." Zada shook her head. "I've taken an afternoon off.

"Well, I'm sure I've still a bottle or two lying somewhere in my cellar, just for the occasion."\n\nZada gave her a sceptical glance. "You meant bottles of juice, right?" In response, Zuana grinned at her friend.\n\n"Of a sort." The zebras exchanged a brief laugh.\n\nThey passed by two piles of bricks and broken stones, standing by both sides of the dirt trail; what remained of the old estate's walls. The overseer managing the lands for some patrician family in Colthage had run west the moment the insurrection began, and the first step the local farmers had taken was taking down those very walls.\n\nNot all that necessary, in Zada's opinion. Some of her neighbours had later joked that those decrepit walls were gonna come down on their own anyway in but a couple of days.\n\nZada's gaze wandered to her right, towards the maize fields stretching out all along the small incline, and a soft smile made her way on her lips. Seeing her own handiwork always made her chest swell with pride. The work in the fields was hard but, judging by the stalks, the next harvest would at least be plentiful one. A certain quota would be ceased to LAE officials as per agreement, but the rest would belong to her village, not to some far-away landowner.\n\nAnd knowing that she was working to feed her friends and family, her own community, well, that did make Zada's fatigues a little easier to endure." #AAAAAAH #Event about life of on some agricultural commune

At best, he feared Colthage would just shoot down the proposal; at worst, he could already picture the Constitutionalists declaring it an attempted insurrection and marshalling troops on the border. A bit too much? Maybe, but old habits die hard, or so the saying went.\n\nHowever, as his eyes scanned the letter's content, Ozid let out a soft breath he hadn't realized he was holding. Colthage had accepted his proposal for a Dual Constitution. Why? He couldn't be sure, yet there it was, ink on paper.

CVA_CTH_fixing_whats_broken:0 "In Zeshmunazash's Memory" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_fixing_whats_broken_desc:0 "Through the fire and the storm we have fought. Despite the trials, and despite the loss of our beloved leader, we came out on top. Now, at the founding of the great Colthaginian Federation, Zarishat Zeirutid addresses the nation to honour the memory of her dear brother."
CVA_CTH_a1:0 "Punish The Landlords" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a1_desc:0 "Our struggle was born in the farmlands of Coltva thanks to the rapacity of the landlords, and though the path was long, we now are in a position to deal with them for good. No more shall they exploit the common zebra, for today is the day of reckoning!"
CVA_CTH_a2:0 "Target The Scientific Clique" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a2_desc:0 "The Scientifids are still out there, and though they are beaten, they are not yet broken. Unless we make sure to deal with them on a more permanent basis, we will not be able to rest on our laurels. They had their chance, history judged them wanting, and now they pay the price."
CVA_CTH_a3:0 "Anti-Intellectual Proscriptions" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a3_desc:0 "The republic was in the end little more than a playground for ivory tower intellectuals to engage in endless quibbling as they invented a million forms of reactionary pseudo-ideologies. Yet, there's an equally misguided as widespread pride in this system, and it will not be easily uprooted."
CVA_CTH_a4:0 "Starites In Our Midst" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a4_desc:0 "Of all the movements that has taken hold in the federation, the Starites must be the most insane of them all. Between their weird esoteric beliefs, their secrecy and utter and complete lack of anything resembling mercy or restraint, they seem more akin to a fever dream than an actual movement. They are real though, and they will need to be dealt with."
CVA_CTH_a5:0 "Tackling The Famine" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a5_desc:0 "Thanks to the chaos of these last years, malnutrition and starvation runs rampant. Between corruption, devastation, mismanagement and seemingly sheer malice, we are not producing even nearly enough to feed the people. This must be addressed, and fast."
CVA_CTH_a6:0 "Redefine The Plan Of Kizil-Zeb" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a6_desc:0 "The Kizil-Zeb Plan saw many successes in Coltva, but Zarishat is unconvinced that it is what the federation needs. The time to make concessions is long since past, and if the lack of a gentle hoof means the reactionaries will be more willing to resist... well isn't that killing two birds with one stone?"
CVA_CTH_a7:0 "Karamane Plantation Collectivisation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a7_desc:0 "The rubber plantations in southern Karamane have long been a cash cow for the state, even if more and more of it has been bought up by private interests. This will be rectified, and then its resources will once more belong to the people."
CVA_CTH_a8:0 "Zeordu Farmland Consolidation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a8_desc:0 "In Coltva, the land reforms could be steadily carried out over a long time. Now, we will act decisively and swiftly. Zeordu will be the first to be transformed as we carry out our land reforms in one blow. It will be a messy affair, but the lessons learned will allow us to carry our further reforms going ahead with much greater ease."
CVA_CTH_a9:0 "Restructure The Textile Industry" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a9_desc:0 "Colthage's textile industry was born out of an attempt to compete with the Maregyptians' cotton, and it was decently successful at this. A plan has been proposed by Zillquat Zaladid, a former technocrat who joined the socialist cause, under which this industry can be brought into the fold and expanded both."
CVA_CTH_a10:0 "Corrective Labour" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a10_desc:0 "Clemency is a luxury, and luxuries are the mark of the bourgeoisie. Those who fought against us are too many to do away with, but that doesn't mean we can't make sure that they pay us back for the troubles they caused us through toil and sweat."
CVA_CTH_a11:0 "The Work For Bread Program" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a11_desc:0 "The famine must be dealt with post-haste, and as a part of it, a program has been put forth under which food items will constitute valid payment for labour. There are precious few who are not struggling to feed themselves, and this will not only free up monetary resources, but also mitigate their hunger."
CVA_CTH_a12:0 "A Ban On Usury" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a12_desc:0 "The amount of zebras trapped in debt by scheming moneylenders and banks is nothing short of obscene, and the remedy is simple. From this day forward, charging interest will be outlawed completely, and those who have charged too high interest will be forced to pay back said interest."
CVA_CTH_a13:0 "Department Of National Agricultural Organization" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a13_desc:0 "With the tumultuous land reforms that have been carried out recently, we will have to make sure to keep clear records of who owns what land, and redistribute it as needed to ensure maximum production. Farmers shall own their lands, true, but the state will administer its distribution."
CVA_CTH_a14:0 "Industrial Reconstruction" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a14_desc:0 "The Colthaginian industrial sector is much like its agricultural one; infested with oligarchs and monopolists. As we've started to deal with the issue of the famine, we can now turn our gaze to this field and ensure that the industrial sector is brought in line with the revolutionary ideals as well."
CVA_CTH_a15:0 "Agricultural Quotas" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a15_desc:0 "If the famine shall be defeated, all must give all they can. We can trust in our revolutionary brothers, but there are many farmers who might not be as motivated. If they will not act out of revolutionary zeal, they will simply have to act out of legal obligation as we implement strict quotas to be met."
CVA_CTH_a16:0 "Penal Worker Settlements" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a16_desc:0 "The thousands of reactionaries who now pay off their debt to the federation through labour can be found all over Colthage. In order to make the most of them, it is for the best that we concentrate them to special settlements where work is plenty and security is high."
CVA_CTH_a17:0 "National Department Of Labour" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a17_desc:0 "The labour produced by our people is a precious resources, not to be squandered. Yet the supply and demand is also unevenly distributed. Ozid has spearheaded the creation of a department dedicated to making sure that wherever there is a job that needs doing, we will find someone able to do it."
CVA_CTH_a18:0 "Selective Charity" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a18_desc:0 "The state cannot do everything, and at times, private interests can be helpful. We should encourage and support private initiatives, but that doesn't mean we can't make sure to aid those charities who are friendly to us, and hinder those who have ideas we don't approve of."
CVA_CTH_a19:0 "Restructure The Academia" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a19_desc:0 "The Colthaginian institutes of higher learning have a long and proud history, but they are also a fertile breeding ground for technocrats and other counter-revolutionaries. In order to ensure the security of our nation, we will simply have to reorganise them in order to ensure our students learn the right lessons."
CVA_CTH_a20:0 "The Future Of The Nation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a20_desc:0 "Our universities have been reorganised and expanded, and they are now ready to educate the next generation of federation leaders and scientists."
CVA_CTH_a21:0 "Mass Reindustrialisation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a21_desc:0 "The age of famine and poverty is coming to an end. Thanks to the efforts of our people and the leadership of our government, we are reaching a point where our industry is well and truly restored to the level of its glory days."
CVA_CTH_a22:0 "Social Justice" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_a22_desc:0 "None shall be left behind, and none shall feel like they are ignored by our nation. This is our pledge to the people of the federation, no matter their race or their ancestry."
CVA_CTH_c1:0 "Going Cold Turkey" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c1_desc:0 "Alcohol doesn't ask questions or comment on how your brother is such a shining exemplar. It doesn't make you feel inadequate or force you to live in the shadows of others. It's been her comfort for so long, and gods she will miss it..."
CVA_CTH_c2:0 "Work With Bandolier" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c2_desc:0 "Zannido Zidon is a menace like few, but he is not completely unreasonable. Though he's infamous in most of the country, the zebras of Zur view him as a hero. Maybe we should consider working with him? Though it'd be deeply unpopular to many, it'd bring the northwest into our fold as well as give us a talented general."
CVA_CTH_c3:0 "We Have No Need For Bandits" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c3_desc:0 "Zannido Zidon is a bandit and a murderer. He has no place in the federation except in the deepest dungeon! We have pledged to be the leaders of this land, and how would it look if we bargained with his ilk?"
CVA_CTH_c5:0 "Committee Of Public Salvation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c5_desc:0 "It'd be naive in the extreme to think that just because we won, the nation will be behind us. Our top priority right now should be to make sure that we give the people safety from all those who would tear down that which we are building."
CVA_CTH_c6:0 "Streamline The Judicial Process" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c6_desc:0 "We will stand behind justice, but we cannot be bogged down in procedure while we do so. Greater weight given to witnesses loyal to our cause, making the defendants defend themselves and similar policies will allow us to expedite the process."
CVA_CTH_c7:0 "Bureaucratic Reconstruction Effort" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c7_desc:0 "The old bureaucracy left from before our victory is not inherently broken. It can still serve us as long as we make sure to pay special heed to flush out any leftover loyalists. That way, the people can still interact with the old familiar institutions, even though it inwardly is rebuilt from the ground up."
CVA_CTH_c8:0 "The Anti-Constitutionalist Decree" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c8_desc:0 "Some would have considered the Constitutionalists allies, but that was before the death of Zeshmunazash. They proved their true mettle then, and we have not forgotten. Yet at the same time, they are not a threat like the technocrats. Their party will be outlawed and they will be thrown in jail, but we will leave it at that."
CVA_CTH_c9:0 "A Bullet For The Zarcids" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c9_desc:0 "When you are dealing with a disease, equivocating or waffling around will only hurt you even more. The Zarcids are responsible for all the problems plaguing the country, and they shall be exterminated, lest they take over and ruin everything once again."
CVA_CTH_c10:0 "A Bayonet For The Patricians" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c10_desc:0 "The elites have sat in their mansions and estates for centuries, preening mightily above the heads of the common worker. They think they can scramble to secure their position in the new order as well, but we will teach them the folly of their ways."
CVA_CTH_c11:0 "Mass Property Re-Acquisition" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c11_desc:0 "The elites had built their tiny fiefdoms across Colthage, and unimaginable wealth had been gathered here. These great properties, built on the backs of the exploited, will be reclaimed by the people's state so that those who worked to build it may reap the fruits of their work."
CVA_CTH_c12:0 "Restore Order In Hippone" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c12_desc:0 "The Starites have been allowed to run rampant for too long. With stability slowly returning in the heartland, we can now march west and show them that a bunch of jesters in gas masks are no match for the strength of the people!"
CVA_CTH_c13:0 "Restore The Hippone Territorial Fleet" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c13_desc:0 "The Starites' rampage left our naval assets in the region beached and used for other purposes. Thankfully, the damage is not that severe. With sufficient work, we can restore this important part of our navy to its prime."
CVA_CTH_c14:0 "The Semblance Of Normalcy" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_c14_desc:0 "It's come step by step, but news of fighting are getting rarer. Arrests and interrogations are getting more uncommon and the bureaucracy is back up and running. All of a sudden, it feels like it's over."
CVA_CTH_b1:0 "Revolutionary Conscription" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b1_desc:0 "Though the war is over, we are not safe yet, and if we are to ensure the integrity of our federation we must have an army up to the task. The shattered remnants of Colthage's army might well have what we're looking for. If we make sure to sift away ideologues and fanatics, many of them simply wish to fight for their home."
CVA_CTH_b2:0 "Military Worker Brigades" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b2_desc:0 "Our army consists of tens of thousands of able-bodied and highly organised zebras. While there is no war going on they would be better off assisting our rebuilding efforts. Not only will this aid recovery efforts, but it will also help those lacking faith in the revolutionary cause to build respect for the workers."
CVA_CTH_b3:0 "The Modern Liberation Army" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b3_desc:0 "Militias and guerrillas might have been where we started, but we will need something more going ahead. War is an industry these days, and we must apply all our efforts towards industrialising our army."
CVA_CTH_b4:0 "Basic Combat Roles" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b4_desc:0 "Not every zebra will serve the same purpose in battle. Some will shoot, others will dig, others will patch wounds and yet others will handle reconnaissance. This division of martial labour will strengthen our forces immensely."
CVA_CTH_b5:0 "Alchemical Proliferation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b5_desc:0 "The old traditions of alchemy have never gone away, and under us they will flourish. If we make sure that all our units have ready access to the skills and materials needed, they will become stronger in a way only zebras can truly be for it."
CVA_CTH_b6:0 "Rifle Standardisation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b6_desc:0 "The fewer unique parts to an item, the easier it is to produce. Leaving behind the rag-tag armament of our coltvan days, we will now have one standardised rifle across the entirety of our military and police."
CVA_CTH_b7:0 "Reinforce Officer Prerogative" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b7_desc:0 "As much as the OARA is a valued asset, they cannot be allowed to run roughshod over the military. That'd create a cadre of sycophants instead of the able officers' corps we need."
CVA_CTH_b8:0 "Expand The Revolutionary General Staff" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b8_desc:0 "We are sorely lacking in capable officers, and we must make sure to rectify this. Thankfully, General Monzano has given us a list of promising candidates who are not only loyal to the revolution, but also capable commanders."
CVA_CTH_b9:0 "The Red Chargers" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b9_desc:0 "The red flag is carried forth by the brave and the true, and it is only right that we form elite cadres to truly lead the way. Those who thought us mere rebels hiding in the woods shall soon find themselves crushed under the hooves of our most elite red chargers."
CVA_CTH_b10:0 "Officer Professionalisation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b10_desc:0 "To be an officer is a difficult task, and it is wrong to expect it to be done by volunteers who happened to be more popular among their squadmates. Those who take up the task of leadership should be held to the highest professional standards, and be compensated thereafter."
CVA_CTH_b11:0 "Basic Mechanisation" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b11_desc:0 "Even the fastest zebra cannot outrun a modern vehicle, and if we make sure our soldiers are mounted on these vehicles we can redeploy them must faster and without the exhaustion that a long forced march would lead to."
CVA_CTH_b12:0 "Masters Of Metallurgy" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b12_desc:0 "We zebras were the first to forge metal, and yet across the world there are those who would presume themselves our betters. Reaffirming our mastery is not only a patriotic duty, but also sound military thinking. "
CVA_CTH_b13:0 "Pacify The Zebinop Countryside" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b13_desc:0 "Gerza really does not know when to quit. He has rampaged through Zebinop for too long, and his tenacity shows that the only way to stop him will be through bullets. Fortunately, he does not have the kind of armies he once commanded under him, so deploying in force will allow us to end the threat."
CVA_CTH_b14:0 "Masters Of Alchemy" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b14_desc:0 "Alchemy, foundation of modern chemistry, the first joining of magic and science. It is a mark of pride for many zebras, and the federation will not lag behind in developing these arts."
CVA_CTH_b15:0 "Our Dignity Restored" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b15_desc:0 "The countless threats to the federation has been steadily pushed back, and though we are not done yet, we are in a position where none can truly question our status as the rightful rulers of Colthage."
CVA_CTH_b16:0 "National Pacification Campaign" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b16_desc:0 "With the main threats to the federation crushed, we can now turn our attention to the myriad other factions ranging from protestors to bandit groups. If they lay down their arms and surrender that is good. If they refuse to the end we will not hesitate. One way or another, we will have peace again."
CVA_CTH_b17:0 "The Office Of Anti-Reactionary Activities" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b17_desc:0 "Not all threats to the revolution will be overt such, and if we hope to create true stability, we must be mindful of the threats that might seek to subvert our armed forces. The OARA will keep a close eye on them to ensure that they remain faithful."
CVA_CTH_b18:0 "The Federal Territorial Guard" #Sweet
CVA_CTH_b18_desc:0 "The countryside is vast, and there is everything from roving monsters to counter-revolutionaries hiding out there. The FTG will be our weapon here, well armed and motivated soldiers who can uphold law and order in the countryside and protect those who live there from aggression of any kind."

It is one of the largest non-depleted gold mines left in the world, and the wealth that can be extracted from it is far beyond any other mine in Zebrica, besides the Buckure mines."
CVA_CTH_d8:0 "The New Old Frontier"
CVA_CTH_d8_desc:0 "With our many development projects, land is becoming scarce in some regions of Zonicia. Coltdar offers a new opportunity for our citizens to go and make something of themselves in this wild southern land. Hopefully the natives won't mind."
CVA_CTH_e1:0 "The North Sea Direction"
CVA_CTH_e1_desc:0 "If Zonicia is to prosper, it must control the seas. But ever since the rampage of the Storm King, Macawia has usurped that role from Colthage. It's time to show them who the real boss around here is."
CVA_CTH_e2:0 "The Macawian Threat"
CVA_CTH_e2_desc:0 "Just out-competing Macawian merchants won't be enough to neutralize them as a threat. Zarishat has authorized an invasion of their home island based on historic Colthaginian claims to the seas around the three sister islands. It's a shaky claim at best, one that hasn't been enforced for centuries, but it's good enough."
CVA_CTH_e3:0 "Rule The Skies"
CVA_CTH_e3_desc:0 "The Macawians can have the seas for now! We'll own them once we're finished burning their country to the ground. If we can control the skies, we can neutralize their fleet and support our troops in the invasion force."
CVA_CTH_e4:0 "Dominate The Seas"
CVA_CTH_e4_desc:0 "If we can't take down the Macawian fleet, we won't be able to land troops on their shores. Naval dominance is paramount to the success of this invasion, and we can't sacrifice it for anything."
CVA_CTH_e5:0 "Operation: Cockatoo"
CVA_CTH_e5_desc:0 "Macawian control over Uusi Hirvimaa is a recent phenomenon, and the deer there won't object to our rule any more than they did to the rule of the birds, it's an easy land grab."
CVA_CTH_f1:0 "Affirm North Zebrican Neutrality"
CVA_CTH_f1_desc:0 "The affairs of the hippogriffs and the thestrals do not concern us so long as they continue to let us trade in our waters. Once we reassure them of this fact, we are free to proceed with our own operations."
CVA_CTH_g1:0 "Red Colonialism"
CVA_CTH_g1_desc:0 "Colonialism? What colonialism? We are merely liberating the international proletariat from imperialist capitalist oppression across the seas in order to secure their prosperity and to increase the productive forces of both Zonicia and the liberated lands, the fact that people do not understand this shows that they have never read Zarishat's great economic and political works."
CVA_CTH_g2:0 "Operation: Black Bull"
CVA_CTH_g2_desc:0 "Besides Macawia, Asterion controls the other islands in the North Sea that can be used to enforce our naval hegemony. It's a long way to get there, but the profits- I mean myriad benefits, will be well worth it!"
CVA_CTH_g7:0 "Settle The Thousand Isles"
CVA_CTH_g7_desc:0 "While the population centers of Macawia and Asterion can be trusted to our liberated sister-states, their outlying islands need to be under our direct military control. Otherwise the capitalists could use the sea lanes to further oppress the workers!"
CVA_CTH_g3:0 "Operation: Repozebra"
CVA_CTH_g3_desc:0 "Kása is too much of a threat to remain. They've made their opposition to our regime clear, and their Skapatoria agents have proven difficult to weed out from the population. Ever since their volunteers assisted the LAE, they've been a threat we can not ignore. Take them out."
CVA_CTH_g4:0 "Resettle The Kásans"
CVA_CTH_g4_desc:0 "Kásans are really just corrupted Zonicians. Years of Macawian imperialist influence has turned them from a good noble people into one obsessed with an imperialist concept of "personal freedoms" and "liberty". Hopefully by bringing them home and throwing the land to whoever wants it, we can return these misguided souls to the correct path."
CVA_CTH_g5:0 "The Land Of Opportunity!"
CVA_CTH_g5_desc:0 "Kása has never been an advanced place, and its infrastructure is severely lacking. However, they have begun the early stages of industrialization, and we could easily take advantage of this and turn Kása into one large industrial sweatshop, producing all the consumer goods our loyal Zonician citizens need."
CVA_CTH_g6:0 "Exploit Cheap Griffonian Labour"
CVA_CTH_g6_desc:0 "With all the chaos consuming Griffonia, there are many griffons who would kill of a steady job and a wage, no matter how small that wage is. It would be easy to lure them all to our "liberated" lands and offer them a place to work and a home under our benevolent rule."
CVA_CTH_red_imperium:0 "Let The Good Times Roll"
CVA_CTH_red_imperium_desc:0 "We've finally done it. The seas are ours, and no one remains to challenge our domination, it's time to sit back, relax, and make tons of money."
CVA_CTH_i1:0 "The Zonician Liberation Army Marches On!"
CVA_CTH_i1_desc:0 "How far our army has come! With Monzano at the helm and Zarishat back home there isn't anything Zonicia can't accomplish! We won't ever be stopped, our hegemony over the north seas will be assured, and all shall be within our grasp!"
CVA_CTH_i2:0 "The Military Governorship System"
CVA_CTH_i2_desc:0 "In areas where solely civilian government won't cut it, our army needs to be ready to assert control. Because if the army is an extension of the party, and the army lacks control, that would mean the party has lost control over a region. And we can't have that."
CVA_CTH_i3:0 "Sweat, Blood And Tears"
CVA_CTH_i3_desc:0 "There are many zebras who have put years of work into this army. Some of them have even been with what was the LAE since the time of Zeshmunazash. But all of them have fought and bled for an ideal, and ideal that we are the greatest army in the world, defending the greatest nation, lead by the greatest commanders, and guided by the greatest leader. An unimpeachable idea to guide us forevermore."
CVA_CTH_i4:0 "Expand The Ministry Of Wartime Technology"
CVA_CTH_i4_desc:0 "The ministry has done well for us so far, it's invented a lot of new tech and new ideas, but we can fine tune it a bit. Cut some unneeded programs there, hire some more scientists, and dump tons and tons more money into it until we can go to space!"
CVA_CTH_i5:0 "Terminus Est"
CVA_CTH_i5_desc:0 "Terminus Est, the final limit, the end of the end. What is the point of war when you can destroy a city with a bomb or a rocket from out of sight? Will anyone ever threaten our power again once we have this technology? I think not."
CVA_CTH_i6:0 "Strength In Practicality"
CVA_CTH_i6_desc:0 "There is no use for "wonder-weapons" if they don't actually win wars. Consistency and usability wins wars, and we are masters of copy-paste designs and mass production. The wars of the future will be resource and technology wars, and we'll be ahead in both those fields."
CVA_CTH_i7:0 "The Zonician Peacekeeping Corps"
CVA_CTH_i7_desc:0 "Dispatched the whole world over to protect civilians, and Zonician interests, the new peacekeeper corps will be a great tool in this new era of war and soft power. The jewel in our foreign policy crown that will keep us powerful and influential for decades to come."
CVA_gaze_upon_my_works:0 "Gaze Upon My Works"
CVA_gaze_upon_my_works_desc:0 "Look upon my works, ye mighty and despair! Or something like that. Now would be a good time for some nice speeches, a pat on my own back, and in years past, a nice drink. But now, I've actually succeeded. I've surpassed anything my brother thought I could be. I've proven them all wrong."

###ZESH ACCIDENTAL REVOLUTION###
CVA_CTH_2_a1:0 "The Accidental Revolution"
CVA_CTH_2_a1_desc:0 "Well here we are. We didn't want to be here, we aren't power-hungry tyrants, we just wanted basic prosperity for all our comrades. But now we're the national government of Colthage, and there's a lot of work to be done."
CVA_CTH_2_a2:0 "Tackling The Famine"
CVA_CTH_2_a2_desc:0 "The disruption of civil authority across Colthage has broken the delicate balance established by the Colthaginian oligarchs. The food supply has collapsed and we are struggling to supply for the very citizens we revolted for. We must address this issue before anything else, our comrades are counting on us."
CVA_CTH_2_a3:0 "Stick To The Plan"
CVA_CTH_2_a3_desc:0 "The plan of Kizil-Zeb was the comprehensive land reform plan that first spurred the Liberation Army of the East to arms after it was rejected by the Colthaginian government. The plan outlines a gradual series of redistribution and government support for the rural poor, and it now needs to be adapted to the whole of Colthage."
CVA_CTH_2_a4:0 "Repurpose The Karamane Plantations"
CVA_CTH_2_a4_desc:0 "The plantations of Karamane have long grown labour-intensive cash crops, which suited the oligarchs perfectly well when Colthage was a slave-based economy and labour was free. In the face of the current famine however, we must repurpose this agricultural land to grow bananas, which will help alleviate the hunger gnawing at our new citizens."
CVA_CTH_2_a5:0 "The Golden Fields Of Zeordu"
CVA_CTH_2_a5_desc:0 "Corn, cassava, sorghum. The iron triangle that holds together our nation's food supply. And all three can be grown in Zeordu. Its golden fields have provided most of the food for the coastal trade cities of the region for decades. We may find the solution to our food crisis within these fields, but we need to figure out how to repair the damage done."
CVA_CTH_2_a6:0 "The Right To Eat"
CVA_CTH_2_a6_desc:0 "Food production was never the primary problem: the main issue has always been food distribution. In good times, Colthage produced more than enough food to feed everyzeeb, and yet the poor still went hungry. Now that we have secured our food supply, we will codify an inalienable right to eat into our laws: nozeeb deserves to starve, and under our new regime nozeeb will starve."
CVA_CTH_2_a7:0 "Salvage The Industrial Sector"
CVA_CTH_2_a7_desc:0 "The civil war has decimated Colthaginian industry, with many factory workers either being conscripted or rioting against their bosses, and shelling reducing some factories to rubble. Repairing the damaged factories and restarting production in the abandoned ones will allow us to restart our heavy industry, and then direct that industry towards solving the present crisis."
CVA_CTH_2_a8:0 "The Breadbasket Of Northern Zebrica"
CVA_CTH_2_a8_desc:0 "We've secured our food supply, and with our heavy industry reignited we can rebuild the roads needed to get it where it needs to go. The end of the famine is in sight, and more than that: a bright future free of the spectre of starvation not just for Coltva, but for all Zonicians."
CVA_CTH_2_a9:0 "Rebuild The Academia"
CVA_CTH_2_a9_desc:0 "Education is the core of development, every zebra who learns can go on to improve society in their own way. Every idea produced by our schools and higher education institutions can go on to make Zonicia a better place, thus we need to rebuild our labor force of educators. Because if we can continue learning, we can do anything."
CVA_CTH_2_a10:0 "The Principle Of Democratic Education"
CVA_CTH_2_a10_desc:0 "It is no wonder the Zarcid regime lasted so long when every Zonician was either kept illiterate or given an education based on hierarchy and control. Our schools must be places of freedom and questioning, with students choosing what subjects to pursue and punishments severely restricted."
CVA_CTH_2_a11:0 "Technocratic Guidance"
CVA_CTH_2_a11_desc:0 "The scientific clique may have been a tool of the Zarcid regime, but they certainly knew how to run things. By following their guidance, we can rebuild our educational system in an orderly, tested manner, ensuring that our students know to respect their teachers and will be taught the proper way."
CVA_CTH_2_a12:0 "Maintain Academic Autonomy"
CVA_CTH_2_a12_desc:0 "While literacy, independence, and good citizenship are obviously political goals, the education system cannot be reduced to a political tool. Now that we have set up the basic structure of our academia, we will leave it alone, giving it substantial discretion over its own budget and curricula and only intervening when necessary."
CVA_CTH_2_a13:0 "Horizontal Economic Planning"
CVA_CTH_2_a13_desc:0 "For generations, the oligarchs and the patricians have dictated to the citizens of Colthage what they can do with their lives. What jobs they can work, what they can produce, how they can sell. No longer! No great government organ shall tell the people how to live their lives. Local economic issues shall be handled by the locals who shall form councils and unions to address their own issues."
CVA_CTH_2_a14:0 "The Right To Prosper"
CVA_CTH_2_a14_desc:0 "There is no reason a citizen of Zonicia should be in want because of factors outside of their control. Whether it be natural disaster, the death of a breadwinner, or any other such situation, the state has a duty to help them. Every citizen has the right to prosper."
CVA_CTH_2_b1:0 "From Bottom Up"
CVA_CTH_2_b1_desc:0 "From the top down, from the dubious elections to the slavery-based economy, Colthage was a republic but hardly a democracy. We must completely reorganize the Colthaginian political system from the bottom up, so that every creature will have a hoof in the life of their community and the direction of their country."
CVA_CTH_2_b2:0 "Participatory Democracy"
CVA_CTH_2_b2_desc:0 "The right to vote is a paltry thing. What is a right if it is not exercised, if it is not accompanied by educational, cultural and political institutions which let our people make meaningful political choices? We will enshrine democracy as not just a legal right, but a core principle of our society, and encourage every citizen to take an active hoof in the politics of their community."
CVA_CTH_2_b3:0 "Indigenous Autonomism"
CVA_CTH_2_b3_desc:0 "Just as monocultural agriculture drains the soil, the quest for cultural homogeneity drains a nation of its vitality, of its capacity for growth. Our lands are home to many indigenous and minority cultures and races, particularly within Coltva. We will ensure these indigenous cultures retain their autonomy and institutions, so that they may grow and develop rather than being subsumed into the majority."
CVA_CTH_2_b4:0 "Adaptational Socialism"
CVA_CTH_2_b4_desc:0 "We are not communists, that term has been used by authoritarians to destroy nations and oppress creatures around the world. But, we do see merit in socialist economic principles, especially as a way to rebuild after the chaos of the civil war. The bleeding months must end, and socialism will get us there."
CVA_CTH_2_b5:0 "The Governor Of Tefemanei"
CVA_CTH_2_b5_desc:0 "The Zarcid forces aren't down yet, yet it seems like their leadership is wavering. The governor of Tefemanei, as the last high-ranking Zarcid leader left, has contacted the government and offered to negotiate peace. The offer seems sincere, but the the idea of actually negotiating with the Zarcids leaves a bitter taste in many zebras' mouths."
CVA_CTH_2_b6:0 "The Lion Of The West"
CVA_CTH_2_b6_desc:0 "There is a zebra who roams the land out west, running wild and free. Some call him a bandit, some call him a liberator, but he's always been an enemy of the enemy of ours. Zannido "The Bandolier" Zidon has been a powerful local force in Zur for years, and it might be worth bringing him on side. We just need to be careful of his reputation..."
CVA_CTH_2_b7:0 "The Convention Of Zamitha"
CVA_CTH_2_b7_desc:0 "It is time to end the chaos, a conference of the National Unity Front shall be called, a permanent agreement sorted out for how the government shall be run, and everyone shall sign. We shall govern in peace not war. We shall govern for prosperity, not for greed. We shall govern for the good of all, not for the good of the few."
CVA_CTH_2_b8:0 "Reform The Governorates"
CVA_CTH_2_b8_desc:0 "Communes are archaic and unpredictable. Even in this reformed system we wish to create, there is no room for "loudest voice" politics. The old governorates shall be reinstated with modifications. There shall be governors and bureaucrats who shall work to protect the people at all times. After all it's their job."
CVA_CTH_2_b9:0 "For Everycreature, Everything"
CVA_CTH_2_b9_desc:0 "We cannot let the chaos of the past return, a balance must be found between the old order and the radical new world. Local government shall be emphasised at all levels, but they will still be responsible to governorates and their governors, who will moderate the local communes and administrations."
CVA_CTH_2_b10:0 "Enshrine Communal Autonomy"
CVA_CTH_2_b10_desc:0 "The communes established in the wake of the advance of the LAE are the purest expression of the freedom we wish to bring to all of Zonicia. The citizens have rose up and declared they want to govern themselves, and who are we to state the contrary. We have no need for tyrants above us, only comrades next to us."
CVA_CTH_2_b11:0 "Integrate The Ex-Patricians"
CVA_CTH_2_b11_desc:0 "With their forces shattered and the Governor of Tefemanei joining us, we can force our terms on the Patricians. They will be allowed to keep some of their political power, being integrated into the NUF as local representatives. This will hopefully strengthen our regional administrations."
CVA_CTH_2_b12:0 "Confederalise The Union"
CVA_CTH_2_b12_desc:0 "We can not exist under the old banner of Colthage any longer. We aim to create a new union, one without the wounds of the past, without the taint of tyranny or injustice. To this aim, we shall adopt a name long gone, our state shall be called Zonicia. And it shall be a harbinger of liberty for all."
CVA_CTH_2_c1:0 "Full blown Military Reorganization"
CVA_CTH_2_c1_desc:0 "Now that we are the government of all Zonicia and not just Coltva, our army will need major reorganization to grow into our new role. Most importantly, we will have to figure out what to do with the structures of the Colthaginian army with its patchworks of mercenaries, penal battalions, and private armies."
CVA_CTH_2_c2:0 "The Blacklist"
CVA_CTH_2_c2_desc:0 "It would be not only immoral, but foolish to trust the former loyalists of the Zarcids to protect our federation. Many are little better than thugs, and had aspirations to rule as dictators. No. The rotten structure of the old Colthaginian army will be disbanded. The worst officers will be blacklisted, never allowed to pursue military work again."
CVA_CTH_2_c3:0 "Decentralised Recruitment"
CVA_CTH_2_c3_desc:0 "We should expand our recruitment practices in Coltva into all of Zonicia, setting up recruitment centers in the most distant villages to ensure all communities do their part in defending our lands."
CVA_CTH_2_c4:0 "Formalise Regional Defence Committees"
CVA_CTH_2_c4_desc:0 "The defence of the nation can only be carried out by those who care for the nation. In addition to the overall military command structure, each governorate will have a Defence Committee made up of army officials and citizen leaders, who in the event of invasion of our homeland shall coordinate resistance in the region. They may take our lives, but they can never take our freedom!"
CVA_CTH_2_c5:0 "Prioritise Military Healthcare Implementation"
CVA_CTH_2_c5_desc:0 "The second civil war saw horrific casualties on both sides, both from wounds and from infections. Many of those deaths were preventable, had our medical corps been better equipped and trained. We will focus our efforts on improving this vital part of our army, acquiring the latest antibiotics and increasing the length and quality of medic training to ensure we save every life we can."
CVA_CTH_2_c6:0 "Reform The Colthaginian Artillery Corps"
CVA_CTH_2_c6_desc:0 "Artillery is essential to a well-functioning army. While our own use of artillery was quite simple, the Colthaginians developed far more advanced ballistics tables and doctrines. We should use these, and make our own artillery corps as effective as theirs once were."
CVA_CTH_2_c7:0 "Rehabilitate The General Staff"
CVA_CTH_2_c7_desc:0 "Conducting an ideologically-motivated purge would be a waste of valuable soldiers and expertise. The Colthaginian army were merely doing their duty when fighting us, as we did our duty when we defeated them. Better to move forward together, combine our talents and knowledge, and forge a stronger army than we could create alone."
CVA_CTH_2_c8:0 "The Main Battle Rifle Debate"
CVA_CTH_2_c8_desc:0 "Once again, we are an army without a single standard service rifle. While the Garcano has served us well, it is beginning to show its age, and the Colthaginian battalions used their own rifles. We should bring together officers, military scientists and arms manufacturers to decide on a new rifle."
CVA_CTH_2_c9:0 "The Rapid Response Corps"
CVA_CTH_2_c9_desc:0 "Building a corps of motorized riflezebras will allow us to respond more quickly to a changing battlefield, as well as to provide rapid emergency assistance in the case of natural disasters. These motorized units will also prove valuable in exploiting breakthroughs made by our chargers."
CVA_CTH_2_c10:0 "Prioritise Rebuilding The Arms Industry"
CVA_CTH_2_c10_desc:0 "The Zarcid military-industrial complex must be rebuilt, albeit now out of the hooves of corrupt oligarchs. Refurbishing theses arms factories will allow us to equip a new army, befitting the size of our federation and the strength of our neighbours."
CVA_CTH_2_c11:0 "Pardon Select Colthaginian Officers"
CVA_CTH_2_c11_desc:0 "Some of Colthage's best officers languish in jail for crimes committed in defence of the Zarcid regime. But many of those crimes were not even illegal at the time, and more importantly there are many among them who have expressed repentance and possess invaluable skills. A few paroles, a few pardons, and we can tap into the vast talent pools currently being wasted."
CVA_CTH_2_c12:0 "Enshrine Operational Autonomy"
CVA_CTH_2_c12_desc:0 "How our military operates cannot be allowed to be dictated from general staff rooms and conference halls. It is the commanders on the ground who know how to fight the best. Our generals shall get them where they need to go, then the soldiers themselves shall lead us to victory."
CVA_CTH_2_c13:0 "The National Defence Council"
CVA_CTH_2_c13_desc:0 "A council of our best commanders shall form the backbone of all policy to do with the military. Recruitment, tactics, grand strategy, all policies related to the army shall be handled by this National Defence Council. And within its walls, the safety of all Colthage shall be ensured."
CVA_CTH_2_c14:0 "The Revolutionary General Staff"
CVA_CTH_2_c14_desc:0 "Regardless of the nature of our revolution on the civilian front, we need to face reality. Wars cannot be fought by democratic elections, we need to run our army like a modern nation state. A strict command hierarchy and an emphasis on modern tactics and a war of movement will secure our nation's future."

CVA_CTH_2_d1_desc:0 ""This day upon this war-torn ground, we endeavour to create, a more perfect union than the one that came before us. Upon the liberation we were promised a republic, and that turned out to be nothing but a lie. So now we have replaced that union with a new one, free from that original sin of tyranny."\n-Zeshmunazash Zeirutid"

CVA_CTH_2_d2:0 "The Decentralised Economic Model"
CVA_CTH_2_d2_desc:0 "Central control of economic development inevitably leads to the oppression of those on the lower rungs of society. So, our economic system must involve decentralizing economic project and decision making to the governorates and communes, who shall request our support in developing their local regions."
CVA_CTH_2_d3:0 "The Untapped Riches Of Karamane" 
CVA_CTH_2_d3_desc:0 "The Jungles and hills of Karamane have long been ignored by the Zarcid government, with its zebras left to languish in poverty. But we see something more, the jungles may yet hold promise and resources bellow the canopies, and the rivers running through the region have a myriad of uses as well. We shall not be blind to the opportunities in front of us."
CVA_CTH_2_d4:0 "The Golden Fields Of Trotkat-Zeordu"
CVA_CTH_2_d4_desc:0 "Trotkat-Zeordu region produces the highest volume of staple crops of any governorate in Colthage. But as we have already seen, that supply can be disrupted relatively easily, leading to catastrophe. We must stabilise, mechanize, and secure our supply of food, while developing the local industry to support this output."
CVA_CTH_2_d5:0 "Colthaginian Urban Expansion"
CVA_CTH_2_d5_desc:0 "Colthage always has and always will be the center of any Colthaginian state, and this includes our confederation. Conducting urban development projects in the city will allow us to strengthen our industry and build up a true, free, Megapolis on what was previously a symbol on tyranny."
CVA_CTH_2_d6:0 "Zonicia's Western Port"
CVA_CTH_2_d6_desc:0 "The port of Hippone is our main connection with the outside world besides Colthage itself. Goods from Griffonia to Equus flow into its harbour and deals are cut with business, unions, and individuals all the time. While it may be hard for the outside world to understand our economic system, developing this region and our foreign connections is essential to our prosperity."
CVA_CTH_2_d7:0 "The Cash Crops Of Coltva"
CVA_CTH_2_d7_desc:0 "Coltva has for years been forced to grow cash crops to fund the Zarcid regime, and it was these practices and the land consolidation that came with them that first inspired our revolution. Now, with our system listening to the needs of the poor, we can restart development in Coltva involving new ethical cash crops and more!"
CVA_CTH_2_d8:0 "Participatory Planning"
CVA_CTH_2_d8_desc:0 "Economic development can not be allowed to become economic abuse. All levels of society need to be guaranteed the right to have input on the economic changes that happen in their community. Participation from all individuals shall be taken into consideration, as wisdom can be found in all creatures."

CVA_CTH_2_d9:0 "Restore The Zonician Fleet"
CVA_CTH_2_d9_desc:0 "The fleet has somewhat languished in recent times, but now should be a source of pride and accomplishment. Redirecting efforts to restoring the fleet would be a good start in invigorating some national pride, as well as protecting our coastal borders."
CVA_CTH_2_d10:0 "Found The Zonician Coast Guard"
CVA_CTH_2_d10_desc:0 "Rather than having slow, cumbersome ships protecting the coastal borders, it may be prudent to have a more rapid-reaction force, a coastal guard of sorts, to protect us from pirates, smugglers and the like."
CVA_CTH_2_d11:0 "The Air To Sea Coordination Principle"
CVA_CTH_2_d11_desc:0 "Mixing the unique aspects of strong air power with that of an ocean going surface fleet brings up a wealth of possibilities, especially for projecting our force power around the seas."
CVA_CTH_2_d12:0 "Restore The Trade Fleet"
CVA_CTH_2_d12_desc:0 "For generations Colthage has been a trade economy. Going back to the most ancient times of the Zonicians are ancestors have plied the waves for prosperity. To enable our citizens to once again follow this calling, we must restore the great fleet of trade vessels that formed the backbone of Colthaginian maritime power."
CVA_CTH_2_d13:0 "The Wolfpack Theorem"
CVA_CTH_2_d13_desc:0 "One vessel may strike true, but a coordinated group of vessels hunting like the wolves of the land? This is an intriguing idea that we may be able to leverage in our naval theory."
CVA_CTH_2_d14:0 "Fullscale Economic Modernisation"
CVA_CTH_2_d14_desc:0 "Nothing can be left in the past, every aspect of our economy and our society must be modernized. We cannot leave anyone in the age of warlords and tyrants, and only knowledge can enlighten us to be better than our ancestors."
CVA_CTH_2_d15:0 "Mass Agricultural Mechanisation"
CVA_CTH_2_d15_desc:0 "To slave away in the fields, breaking their backs, shall not longer be the fate of the farmers of Zonicia. We can make things better through them. Through the wonders of modern technology we can ensure no one ever has to endure that hardship again."
CVA_CTH_2_d16:0 "Refurbish The Zonician Fishing Fleet"
CVA_CTH_2_d16_desc:0 "As with all things, it would be a useful source of improvement to refurbish and bring the fishing fleet up to standard, or at least repair and salvage what we can. A strong fishing cadre serves the foundation of a naval power."
CVA_CTH_2_d17:0 "The Zonician Naval Infantry Corps"
CVA_CTH_2_d17_desc:0 "Combining the strength of sailors with the rugged adaptability of those bound to serve on land will permit greater potency in naval actions, especially if boarding is required. Strong sea legs will help our troops greatly. Naval soldiers, what an idea."

CVA_CTH_2_d18:0 "Embrace Market Socialism"
CVA_CTH_2_d18_desc:0 "Socialism with markets, it sounds contradictory, but it really isn't. We've been operating on a system of unions, governorates, and communes for years now, and we have seen what socialist principles can do. But, by also guaranteeing our citizens a free market without overpowering top-down control, we can enable prosperity never before seen."
CVA_CTH_2_d19:0 "Country-Wide Electrification"
CVA_CTH_2_d19_desc:0 "Our movement has always been deeply in touch with the rural citizens of our nation and their needs. Equality in opportunity with those in the big cities must be established, and the first step to that is connecting the rural regions to the central power grid. Electricity is the way of the future, and everyone needs access to it."
CVA_CTH_2_d20:0 "Mining Mechanisation Initiative"
CVA_CTH_2_d20_desc:0 "Mining has long been one of the most inhumane forms of labour somezebra could be subjected to. Inhospitable conditions and back breaking work killed many more than war did in centuries past. But modern mining offers a new hope, with machines instead of hooves doing the labor, we can make use of our nations mineral resources without putting our citizens through Tartarus."
CVA_CTH_2_d21:0 "Economic Synchronisation"
CVA_CTH_2_d21_desc:0 "Things have begun to flow smoothly now, with the input of all three factions of the NUF, our economic system is proving to not only be functional, but prosperous! We have shown the tyrants that neither tyranny nor government-based capitalism is required to reach prosperity in the modern world. And that working for the citizens is a way forward for all economies."
CVA_CTH_2_d22:0 "Encourage Socialist Entrepreneurship"
CVA_CTH_2_d22_desc:0 "In a fully communist system, there is no room for individual action. With everything being run by the state, the system becomes stale and rusted quickly. Our people will be allowed to go out with the money they have earned, or was loaned to them by the government, and make something of it. To chase their dreams onto a better future."
CVA_CTH_2_d23:0 "Made In Zonicia"
CVA_CTH_2_d23_desc:0 "Across the world, new goods are showing up on store shelves. Agricultural products, luxuries, and consumer goods. All stamped with the red seal of approval, that they were made in Zonicia. A guarantee that no labourer was harmed, that no greedy capitalist profited, that no government worker was bribed in the process of manufacturing it. And a promise that we will do everything to keep."

CVA_CTH_2_e1:0 "Prosperity For All"
CVA_CTH_2_e1_desc:0 "For generations, the aristocrats have preached an outdated doctrine. They said "prosperity comes to those who wait", a lie with the goal of keeping the people down. We see past this, we know that doing nothing will only perpetuate the systems of oppression that chained us. Now is the time for action, now is the time to bring prosperity to all!"
CVA_CTH_2_e2:0 "Standardise The Land Laws"
CVA_CTH_2_e2_desc:0 "Land reform was the first objective of the LAE when it was formed years ago. But now we control lands beyond just Coltva, and the land issues of other regions are often far more complex. The degree of patrician domination and control varied based on the area, and complex laws regarding property and inheritance are slowing our reform efforts. It's time to iron out these legal codes."
CVA_CTH_2_e3:0 "Designated Cultural Heritage Sites"
CVA_CTH_2_e3_desc:0 "Our culture is something that should be preserved and held dear to us. The traditions of our ancestors, the lives they lived and the tales they left behind, are lessons to learn from. So, in an effort to remember our history, and to not repeat its mistakes, certain locations shall be protected on a federal level as sites of extreme cultural importance. This way we can remember them forever."
CVA_CTH_2_e4:0 "Limited Price Regulations"
CVA_CTH_2_e4_desc:0 "Heavy hoofed market regulation like price fixing often damages the growth of an economy. But in order to ensure the livelihoods of our poorest, the NUF has agreed on a specific list of goods to regulate."
CVA_CTH_2_e5:0 "The Golden Shores Of Zonicia"
CVA_CTH_2_e5_desc:0 "The great golden shores of Zebinop are home to some of the largest cash crop plantations in all of Zonicia. But beyond that, the land is absolutely beautiful. In this era of modern travel, it may be worth investing into a tourism industry, a way to bring prosperity to our land through visiting foreigners."
CVA_CTH_2_e6:0 "Outlaw Private Banking Institutions"
CVA_CTH_2_e6_desc:0 "Private banking is an inherently dangerous concept. While many bankers don't act maliciously, the accumulation of so much wealth in single individuals or institutions allows them too much power over people and politics. Thus, the state shall take on the responsibility of being the sole lender of credit in the nation."
CVA_CTH_2_e7:0 "Standardise The Confederate Law Code"
CVA_CTH_2_e7_desc:0 "With our land codes in order, now we must move on to our overall legal framework. As revolution reigned in Colthage, many groups set up codes of law for their own regions to operate under. But if we are to have a harmonious federation, we need a single, unified law code."
CVA_CTH_2_e8:0 "The Zonician Farmers' Fund"
CVA_CTH_2_e8_desc:0 "The prosperity of farmers and ranchers is under threat in these modern times. But as populations grow, the supply of food must grow to match it. So, in order to keep these farmers prosperous and providing the food the nation needs, a national system of agricultural subsidies will be put in place to support them."
CVA_CTH_2_e9:0 "The Confederate Healthcare Standard Act"
CVA_CTH_2_e9_desc:0 "As the LAE marched west, and the suffering of all Colthaginians was made apparent, more and more members of what would become the NUF came around to the idea of a national healthcare system. Offering a nationalized option, as well as establishing standards for any private healthcare within Zonicia will hopefully prevent significant amounts of suffering in the future."
CVA_CTH_2_e10:0 "Formalise The Peoples' Assemblies"
CVA_CTH_2_e10_desc:0 "One of the more divisive issues to confront the NUF has been that of the "Peoples' Assemblies". Established during the civil war by popular uprisings, these ad-hoc councils have become cemented as part of government as Zonicia's administration formed around them. Unfortunately, they still exist within a legal limbo, and their status must be codified into law."
CVA_CTH_2_e11:0 "The Sins Of The Past Wiped Clean"
CVA_CTH_2_e11_desc:0 "Things are all coming together now. Our reforms are bearing fruit, the citizens are happy. Their lives aren't as bleak as they once were. Where once Colthage was a nation of slaving tyrants, now Zonicia stands as a new bastion of freedom and prosperity for all the world to go through. Zeirutid has accomplished what the "reformists" and "constitutionalists" could never do. He has brought true equality."
CVA_CTH_2_e12:0 "The Zebinop Constitution"
CVA_CTH_2_e12_desc:0 "Signed in the town of Zebinop, the new constitution of the federation will be the first step on the road to a new future for Zonicia. And once pen is put to paper, the great campaign of reforms shall truly begin."

CVA_CTH_2_g1:0 "Liberty Must Be Fought For"
CVA_CTH_2_g1_desc:0 "Liberty can not be achieved without bloodshed. This is the unfortunate truth we have come to see. You can try and lessen the costs of war as much as possible, but tyranny can not just be addressed with kind words. But the war is over now, the bloodshed can end, and a new era can begin."
CVA_CTH_2_g2:0 "Encourage Mass Politics"
CVA_CTH_2_g2_desc:0 "The masses have been shut out of the halls of power for too long, it is time for the creatures of Zonicia to see how the game of politics is played, to see the room where it all happens. So, with the knowledge they gain from seeing our political system running, they can weigh in. Civil political discourse must become a key element of Zonician life, so all voices can be heard."
CVA_CTH_2_g3:0 "Popular Mobilisation"
CVA_CTH_2_g3_desc:0 "The citizens are the driving force of politics in the new Zonicia, action on the local level sends ripples through the communes, through the governorates, and into the NUF's chambers. Every voice matters, every voice must be heard, and every voice calls out in support of one of three factions."
CVA_CTH_2_g4:0 "The Citizen Soldier"
CVA_CTH_2_g4_desc:0 "We cannot force our citizens to die for Zonicia, to do so would be the ultimate betrayal of liberty. Our army can never rely on masses of the poor, stolen from their homes and families. The only way for an army to truly fight for a nation is for it to be made of those who volunteer to fight that battle."
CVA_CTH_2_g5:0 "A Radio In Every Home"
CVA_CTH_2_g5_desc:0 "It is the duty of every citizen to stay informed about politics through all means available, and it is the job of the government to provide those means. Thus was born the project to provide every family in Zonicia with a radio, so that they may know how their government is representing them."
CVA_CTH_2_g6:0 "Pro Patria Mori"
CVA_CTH_2_g6_desc:0 "Sometimes there is a pain we must live with, where we must subject our citizens to a crime unlike any other, to be taken away from everything you love. But that pain is nothing compared to the pain and sacrifice every single soldier endures on the battlefield. It may not be noble to die for one's country, but sometimes it is necessary."
CVA_CTH_2_g7:0 "The Right To A Conscientious Objection"
CVA_CTH_2_g7_desc:0 "Sometimes the responsibility of fighting a war is too wicked for an individual to abide by. They may detest the idea of taking another life, they may disagree with war as a concept. They cannot be forced to be soldiers, on principle and for military reasons. We must allow them to say no to conscription, if they have a clear reason."
CVA_CTH_2_g8:0 "The Confederate Armoury System"
CVA_CTH_2_g8_desc:0 "Localized armament facilities across the nation will assist our populace in remaining ready for any threats to our liberty. In the event of conflict, every willing creature will have access to arms and ammunition to begin the fight against the oppressors."
CVA_CTH_2_g9:0 "A Civic But Voluntary Duty"
CVA_CTH_2_g9_desc:0 "We cannot force creatures to serve, but we can set up a system where they are encouraged to. Extremely basic training for all citizens, plus short tours of duty in times of peace will show our citizens that joining the armed forces is a sacrifice worth making for our nation to retain its freedom."
CVA_CTH_2_g10:0 "Guardians Of Peace And Liberty"
CVA_CTH_2_g10_desc:0 "The Zonician army cannot become an occupying force. It must be the light for the oppressed, an army made up of those willing to fight for the freedom of all. As well as for the concept that every creature, no matter if they have fur or feathers, flippers or hooves, deserves the opportunity to live long and prosper."
CVA_CTH_2_g11:0 "Road Logistics Optimisation"
CVA_CTH_2_g11_desc:0 "There are few inventions that revolutionize the world like the car did. It's uses for both military and civilian transportation are second to none, and it is no surprise the army is requesting a full new paved highway network be built across all governorates of Zonicia."

CVA_CTH_2_h1:0 "The Zonician Liberation Army"
CVA_CTH_2_h1_desc:0 "The Liberation Army of the East has been transformed in the past years, but there is always more work to be done. Despite the peace we have secured for ourselves, there are others out there who yet still threaten liberty. So we shall continue to advance, continue to modernize, and prepare ourselves for the next struggle."
CVA_CTH_2_h2:0 "Abandon Bolt Action Rifles"
CVA_CTH_2_h2_desc:0 "As war evolves into the age of the tank and the airplane, we cannot let the individual soldier be left behind. Bolt-action rifles are no longer enough in the modern age of war, so they shall be updated and replaced with semi-automatic and automatic weapons more suited to this new age."
CVA_CTH_2_h3:0 "Alchemical Field Kits"
CVA_CTH_2_h3_desc:0 "For generations our ancestors have been masters of alchemy, and now we see a way to apply these skills to the modern age. Healing potions and salves for wounds shall be distributed to units across the front, ensuring that each soldier has the very best chance of making it out of their hospital bed alive."
CVA_CTH_2_h4:0 "The Standard Officer Curriculum Debate"
CVA_CTH_2_h4_desc:0 "Within the NUF, there's disagreement on how our officers should be trained. Each faction prioritises a different aspect of both tactical and strategic warfare. Whatever opinion comes out on top, we need to ensure our generals are of the highest skill and ready to defend Zonicia from all threats."
CVA_CTH_2_h5:0 "Centralized Armament Production"
CVA_CTH_2_h5_desc:0 "While military policy across the Confederation is often decentralized and controlled by regional administrations, we need to ensure there will ways be enough equipment for our national army. So, a central network of munitions plants and supply hubs shall be formed to ensure the army is never lacking in weapons to defend our nation."
CVA_CTH_2_h6:0 "The Nutritional Battlefield"
CVA_CTH_2_h6_desc:0 "War is complete drudgery for those condemned to fight in it. We must do what little we can to lessen the suffering of our soldiers on the front. One policy, suggested by General Ozid, is the implementation of a far higher standard of field ration for the average soldier. This will hopefully make the front feel a bit more like home."
CVA_CTH_2_h7:0 "The Ministry Of Wartime Technology"
CVA_CTH_2_h7_desc:0 "To ensure we are always ready to fight a war, even if we do not wish for one, a permanent military council shall be established advising our scientists and engineers on how to constantly advance our capacity to defend the Confederation."
CVA_CTH_2_h8:0 "Fullblown Infantry Corps Mechanisation"
CVA_CTH_2_h8_desc:0 "The future of warfare lies in mechanization. As our industry develops and we can extract more resources from our land, the dream of a fully armored and mechanized army comes closer to being achieved. The opportunity to reduce casualties, increase speed of movement, as well as offensive and defensive strength is too good to pass up."
CVA_CTH_2_h9:0 "The Aerial Logistics Department"
CVA_CTH_2_h9_desc:0 "In the rough terrain of North Zebrica, it is often difficult to get supplies where they need to go, thus the air force shall step in to take a role in keeping our troops fed, clothed, and with enough ammunition to keep fighting."
CVA_CTH_2_h10:0 "The Zonician Special Forces Command"
CVA_CTH_2_h10_desc:0 "Elite special forces will be a core part of modern warfare as operations become more and more specialized. A directorate of some of our most tactically skilled commanders, like Zanuzel Zala, shall vet our forces for recruits who could possibly serve a greater purpose."
CVA_CTH_2_h11:0 "Expand The Zebinop Bauxite Mines"
CVA_CTH_2_h11_desc:0 "The use of Bauxite and its derivatives in aircraft production is nearly universal. If Zonicia is to ever have a fully operation airforce we will need more of this mineral for our factories."
CVA_CTH_2_h12:0 "Combined Arms Operations"
CVA_CTH_2_h12_desc:0 "The orthodox faction of the NUF is dedicated to the idea of combined arms warfare. Where the infantry is mechanized and backed up directly by armoured forces. They believe a slow, steady advance is preferred to operations with a higher risk of failure and death."
CVA_CTH_2_h13:0 "The Lighting Warfare Theorem"
CVA_CTH_2_h13_desc:0 "Both pragmatist and evolutionary commanders agree, tanks are the future of modern war. The speed and firepower they provide can smash through enemy infantry lines and strike decisively against all threats. War must be as fast as lightning, and just as hard hitting."
CVA_CTH_2_h14:0 "The Stovepipe M1"
CVA_CTH_2_h14_desc:0 "If our infantry are to have any hope of fighting a new generation of armoured vehicles, we need to equip them with adequate anti-tank weapons. The "Stovepipe" is the latest of these weapons designed by the Ministry and shall enter general service soon."
CVA_CTH_2_h15:0 "The M16 'Ozid'" #Joke on Ozid's weight, based on the M26 Pershing
CVA_CTH_2_h15_desc:0 "Ozid has been one of our most dedicated commanders ever since the inception of the LAE. His focus on combined arms warfare and infantry protection at all costs makes it clear how to reward him. At the suggestion of Zarishat Zeirutid, the M16 'Ozid' shall be a new terror on the battlefield. A massive, hulking beast of steel, it will terrify opponents with its sheer size and girth."
CVA_CTH_2_h16:0 "The Inter-Service Coordination Office"
CVA_CTH_2_h16_desc:0 "The army, navy, and airforce can not exist separate from one another. They are all key parts of our effort to defend freedom in North Zebrica and so they must cooperate with one another. Without enforcing this coordination, our military will never achieve its full potential."
CVA_CTH_2_h17:0 "The Confederate Fighter Fleet"
CVA_CTH_2_h17_desc:0 "Control over the skies will be key to control over the land war in all future conflicts. We can equip as many bombers as we want, but if we can't protect our own troops from above, all is lost."
CVA_CTH_2_h18:0 "Air To Land Coordination"
CVA_CTH_2_h18_desc:0 "The ability to strike from the skies at enemy forces is only a recent innovation in warfare. Bombs and rockets fired from above have the ability to decimate enemy formations. We must make an effort to innovate in these designs."
CVA_CTH_2_h19:0 "The Armament Design Regulation Bureau"
CVA_CTH_2_h19_desc:0 "A sub-division of the Ministry of Wartime Technology, the Armament Design Regulation Bureau will be in charge of the finer parts of equipment design and manufacture. It is their job to ensure that the weapons we give to our soldiers are the best tools possible to fight for the preservation of their homes."
CVA_CTH_2_h20:0 "The Confederate Strategic Oil Reserve"
CVA_CTH_2_h20_desc:0 "We are not blessed with the oil reserves of Arabia or Wingbardy, and fuel is absolutely essential in modern war. If we are ever going to fight a war against a power that can cut off our access to foreign oil, we need to make sure that we have enough in reserve, lest our army slow to a halt."
CVA_CTH_2_h21:0 "Magical Rifle Implementation"
CVA_CTH_2_h21_desc:0 "At the request of the A.D.R.B., the army has begun experiments into replacing all normal rifles with weapons powered by magical crystals. While this will be an extremely long and difficult process, the Ministry believes we have the industrial capacity to use these weapons to their full effectiveness."
CVA_CTH_2_h22:0 "The Jaguar Of Zebrica Wakes"
CVA_CTH_2_h22_desc:0 "A new army has risen from the ashes of the old Mercenaries of Colthage. An army dedicated to the preservation of liberty, and the protection of creatures everywhere. The Jaguar has awoken, and like a Jaguar, if any threaten our freedoms, we shall not hesitate to defend ourselves with force of arms."

CVA_CTH_2_i1:0 "The Zapsa Manifesto"
CVA_CTH_2_i1_desc:0 "There is a new light rising in the world. A nation where all may be truly free from the shackles of poverty and oppression. While we cannot force our ideas on the world, we ardently believe that all must be able to make the choice for themselves of how they wish to be ruled, this shall be our great mission."
CVA_CTH_2_i2:0 "The Old Frontiers"
CVA_CTH_2_i2_desc:0 "There are lands that lie within other states inhabited by zebras who call themselves Zonician. Many among them cry out to join in the freedom we offer. But we cannot be rash or violent, we shall hold out hope to solve these issues with words, with force of arms as a last resort."
CVA_CTH_2_i3:0 "The North Zebrican Mutual Assistance Fund"
CVA_CTH_2_i3_desc:0 "Shared prosperity is in the interest of all Zonicians. We must make a genuine effort to reach out to those around us, and offer them a kind hoof. We can grow and prosper together, we are not enemies, but instead friends. Friendship is harmony, friendship is prosperity, and friendship makes magic things happen."
CVA_CTH_2_i4:0 "The Hippone Address"
CVA_CTH_2_i4_desc:0 "North Zebrica has been under too many tyrants for too long. First the Storm King, and then the warlords who rose up to replace him. Now our land is at peace, but others who surround us still desire war and conflict. We must protect the creatures of North Zebrica from the tyrants who surround them, whatever the cost."
CVA_CTH_2_i5:0 "The International Scientific Cooperative"
CVA_CTH_2_i5_desc:0 "While great minds do think alike, they can accomplish even more by thinking together. A research network with our allies will share discoveries and innovations that can be put to work bettering the lives of our citizens."
CVA_CTH_2_i6:0 "The Coltdar Redevelopment Committee"
CVA_CTH_2_i6_desc:0 "Coltdar, while a land of great opportunity, was neglected by the Quaggatai government. A series of projects to update its infrastructure and improve the lives of its residents will act as a show of good intentions to those who live there."
CVA_CTH_2_i7:0 "Apply The Principle Of Self-Determination"
CVA_CTH_2_i7_desc:0 "We are not conquerors, we are not dictators, we only desire what the people desire. The creatures of Coltdar have made clear where their loyalties lie, but we should not force rulership on the rest of the creatures of Quagga."
CVA_CTH_2_i8:0 "The Quagga Reconstruction Commission"
CVA_CTH_2_i8_desc:0 "To show the creatures of Quagga that we mean well, we shall invest in modernizing their homeland, and bringing it into the modern age, and further connecting it with the other economies of North Zebrica."
CVA_CTH_2_i9:0 "The Matter Of Coltdarian Autonomy"
CVA_CTH_2_i9_desc:0 "The creatures of Coltdar have not yet decided on the fate of their region. Autonomy and Integration campaigns are abuzz in Angzen, Zerankara, and Ispardur. This matter must be settled quickly so that we hold to our promises to the Coltdarian people."
CVA_CTH_2_i10:0 "The Large Bat In The Room"
CVA_CTH_2_i10_desc:0 "When Chiropterra was revealed to the world, it became clear that they were the worst of the worst. Slavers and tyrants forced religion on the zebras of the north, indoctrinating them into a foreign cult. They are anathema to all we stand for, and we must be ready to bring them down."
CVA_CTH_2_i11:0 "The Hippogriffian Problem"
CVA_CTH_2_i11_desc:0 "Hippogriffia is a far more diverse bag. While there are perspective tyrants among them, they are generally an amenable people who's only fault is a slight superiority complex. But they are a monarchy, and we must be careful with them, as monarchs will hold onto their power at all costs."
CVA_CTH_2_i12:0 "Untangle The Tobuckian Issue"
CVA_CTH_2_i12_desc:0 "Tobuck as a nation is purely artificial. Created by gun-runners and corrupt merchants, it is a unique nation building project that has nearly born fruit. However, its lands are claimed by two separate realms, so we need to try and sort this out."
CVA_CTH_2_i13:0 "Cast Down The Darkness"
CVA_CTH_2_i13_desc:0 "From darkest night, we can only pray that a new dawn shall be born. If there has ever been a righteous war, this way be it. The time has come to throw down the tyrants, whatever the cost."
CVA_CTH_2_i14:0 "The Principle Of Moral Diplomacy"
CVA_CTH_2_i14_desc:0 "Morality cannot be forgotten when we go abroad to sign treaties. Dictators shall not be engaged with, tyrants will be denounced, and our values shall be held above pragmatic goals."
CVA_CTH_2_i15:0 "International Revolutionary Training Camps"
CVA_CTH_2_i15_desc:0 "Across the world, the oppressed cry out for saving, and a brave few answer the call. Many years ago, the LAE was that brave few for Coltva, and we must offer the freedom fighters of the world a chance to win freedom for their comrades. Zonicia will provide training and weapons for these brave warriors of freedom in their fight to live free."
CVA_CTH_2_i16:0 "Our Friends Across The Sea"
CVA_CTH_2_i16_desc:0 "While Macawia's republic is flawed, they still have a strong democratic tradition that we must respect, as well as being a powerful trade state. But Macawia's spiritual child is a far more unique case. The Kasa Free State is a first rate friend, a nation of our own kind, and another land where creatures truly live free. Kasans fought with Coltvans in the wars for freedom, so there is no better ally for our new nation."
CVA_CTH_2_i17:0 "Public Diplomacy Tactics"
CVA_CTH_2_i17_desc:0 "If we are forced to occupy a foreign land for a time, we must make known our true intentions. We fight for the freedom of all, and do not wish to remain occupiers for long. Hopefully the creatures of those lands will understand, we truly do not wish to hurt them."
CVA_CTH_2_i18:0 "The End Of An Era"
CVA_CTH_2_i18_desc:0 "Huh. Here we are. The end has been reached. North Zebrica is free, the creatures have democratic governments, tyrants have been removed. Zonicia is prospering, the people are happy. My work is finally done. I've been fighting for so long, and now my work is finally done. How did I get here? I wish I actually knew, maybe then I'd be able to tell more jokes about it."

colthaginian_federation.1.t:0 "On The Shoulders Of A Giant" #Sweet
colthaginian_federation.1.d:0 "The sun was too bright, the crowd too loud, and the gentle breeze did nothing to stop her headache. Zarishat took a deep breath as she held onto the pulpit, feeling her mouth water weirdly and a wave of nausea came over her. At least, her quickly covering her mouth and looking down probably came across as grief, and she swallowed to push the nausea down.\n\n"Fellow comrades of the revolution," she began, her voice raspy from the night before. "I never expected to be standing here before you today. This was meant to be my brother's moment... like everything else in life. He always stood there, shining like he was so much better than everyone else and-and we are all left weeping over his death." It was an exertion to correct herself, as all she wanted to do was to puke bile all over that self-righteous, arrogant pig she had endured her entire life. Getting back on topic, she continued with more fervor.\n\n"But I promise you, comrades of the struggle, that we are not stopping here. We are not quitting the struggle, indeed we have only begun! The revolution marches forward, and we shall complete my brother's labours! We shall punish those who ended his life, as we shall bring justice down upon those who have exploited and oppressed us for so long! The revolution lives!" She finished, actually managing to cry out and raise one hoof up to the air and provoke a thunderous response from the onlookers. It all kept going for way too long, and when she finally got off the stage she shook her head in exhaustion.\n\nShe had a chance right now, a chance unlike anything she'd ever imagined possible. With her brother out of the picture, she was the one they looked to for leadership, and if she didn't seize this opportunity, she'd never see anything like it again. Who'd have thought the best thing her brother could do for her was to die..."

colthaginian_federation.2.t:0 "The Generalissimo" 
colthaginian_federation.2.d:0 "News are trickling in from Zebinop-Amanesya, where the old order has come roaring back. We had thought Gerza was dealt with, but he evidently isn't down for the count yet. Along with a cadre of loyalists and allies, he has seized the region, cut Colthage in two and caused chaos. His army is deeply dug in across the hilly region, and attempts to dislodge them have already failed. If we are to stop that zebra, it'll take resources we don't have right now." 
colthaginian_federation.2.a:0 "Why couldn't he have just died?"

colthaginian_federation.3.t:0 "The Star Father's Children" 
colthaginian_federation.3.d:0 "Hippone has fallen.\n\nWhat information we have is disjointed and sometimes contradictory, but what we do know is that militants have seized the Hippone region. They are seemingly not connected to any of the factions we have contended with so far, and instead seem connected to the local patricians somehow. Wherever these masked figures come from though, they have quickly established a hard grip over the region. They are numerous and well armed, and the best we have managed to achieve is to contain them in Hippone, for now."
colthaginian_federation.3.a:0 "Who are these people even!?"

colthaginian_federation.4.t:0 "The Political Mosquitoes" #Sweet
colthaginian_federation.4.d:0 "It seems the Constitutionalists are determined to continue defying us. While their power has been broken, it's not fully gone yet, and they are hard at work trying to rally support against the Zarishat government. Their junior members — especially those that were allowed to remain on their posts after our takeover, have been relentlessly harrying us, attempting to sway our leaders with speeches and negotiations. Those senior members that we chased out of the government are out there working the government, trying to rally popular support for their ideas as well.\n\nThat they, even after all that they have done, would presume to speak for the common zebra would be amusing, if it were not so annoying. Thankfully they are still weakened, and it is unlikely they will be a real threat instead of just a headache."

Couldn't they just have run out and started lynching zebras left and right, and then they could rein in the worst excesses? No, apparently not. It seemed like she had to take charge even here. \n\nIn Coltva, they had worked slowly and steadily, but now it would all come crashing down at once not the least thanks to the vicious war that had brought them here. Now, they would have to deal with their enemies all at once, and she really didn't care much for dealing with this. No matter the call, she'd piss important zebras off.\n\nThey had to be firm, that much she understood, but going after the technocrats alone wouldn't do it. The zebras under her wanted blood, and the constitutionalists hadn't done themselves any favour. Maybe it'd be for the best to target them as well, and truly bring the wrath of the revolution and all that down on their heads? It'd cause a lot of unrest, but it'd give her army what they wanted. Of course, she could just play nice, blab something about moving forwards and minimise the retaliation against them.\n\nWhatever she did, she had to make a call though.

They'll see their due retribution being cast aside, only getting this waffling about... what, harmony?"\n\n"I'm not going to turn into Celestia, and I'm not going to be weak", Zarishat snapped. "You want to see retribution and a firm hoof? You'll get it, just you wait and see.

It blocked out all the things she didn't want to deal with, and rested over her like a comforting blanket.\n\nOf course it was killing her, she didn't need zebras telling her that. Not that many of them would these days. She could drink as much as she jolly well wanted, and none would bother her, and that was why she had to end it here and now. This wasn't about what she desired, this was about what she had to do. She couldn't blame others for her hangovers and drunken evenings any longer. She'd had this position fall onto her out of sheer luck, but either she stopped now, or she'd slip up and share her brother's fate sooner or later.\n\nThat was why she stood by the sink, pouring out every last bottle of alcohol she had, making sure to not breathe through her nostrils so the smell wouldn't tempt her. How long had she lasted before? A week maybe, two at one point. It was now or never though, and she grimaced as she finished pouring out the last bottle and put it on the counter. Pouring herself a mug of tea, she sipped it and instantly felt the desire to pour in some liquor as well.

Her personal chefs had been run ragged, whipping up new luxurious meals for her that could help with the distraction, and doing so daily. If she could not drink, she'd have the best food available, and drown out the need for drink with the pleasures that food gave. Along with it, she'd taken up new hobbies to distract herself. Manehattan designer clothing, Saddle Arabian jewellery, even Aquileian headwear, and though she couldn't drink any longer, she could tickle the senses in other ways, be it Hindian incense or Wingbardian perfumes.\n\nIf she couldn't have a drink, she'd have everything else.

He preferred to be guided by his grandmother's last words; "I'd rather hear once of your kindness, than a thousand times of your wealth". It was hard at times, not the least when the Coltvan peasant uprising had come to his doors. Yet, he had submitted to their Kizil-Zeb plan, believing sincerely that it was the best way to keep peace, and that from his concession they all could move forward together.\n\nYet, it had become clear to him that he had been alone in that thought. While at first he had thought things would get better, those hopes were dashed as he looked down on the letter, which coldly informed him that he had one week to depart his property with only what he could carry, as the land he occupied was now considered property of the federation. He read it over and over, trying to comprehend what was going on. This couldn't be right, this wasn't what was meant to happen. He had cooperated, hadn't he? He was willing and ready to submit to the Coltvans' government, give up large parts of his property to help his fellow Zebras.

Work, a home and food for as long as you're here, and you get a chance to aid in the revolution along with your fellow comrades!"\n\nShe didn't have a clue what he was on about.

The first zebra shrugged, stepping forward as one worker after another was given a package of food. It was a long line, but thankfully things were moving quickly.

At least the classes would be the same boring ones they had been before the war, with the same boring classmates.\n\nAs he entered and found a place, he looked forward to slipping down into the familiar miasma of tedium, only to be surprised as the lecturer began by telling them that the curriculum had been revised, and that in addition they would be assigned a new bloc of classes. Schedules were passed around the classroom, and Zeshef looked at it in befuddlement.

Many of them had still been in the area when the war had swept through, and the artillery barrages had brought down large parts of the entire district. The fact that the socialists had managed to rebuild it so quickly was impressive, but it was also very clear that they weren't just simple workers any more. The new bosses took their work very seriously, which was nice on one hoof, but on the other... nozebra wanted to be the first to disappoint them.

Rise at dawn, hard physical work to strengthen the body, the simple and straightforward existence of knowing exactly what you needed to do. What a foal he had been.\n\nRising up from his bunk bed as the bells rang outside, he groaned as he rolled his neck, feeling the pain in the left side of it. Still sore, and had been for three days now. All he had done was try to argue with the guards that his bunkmate was sick and couldn't work as hard as they wanted. That, apparently, made him deserve the baton to them. His bunkmate wasn't looking too cheery either. He was pale, and that infection on his leg didn't look good at all.\n\nUrging the young zebra to come with him, he walked outside to line up and receive the day's instructions from the camp commander. It was cold outside, and he shivered slightly. The landscape where their camp lay was beautiful, that much he could admit, but it was kind of hard to see beyond the quarry, the high barbed wire fences and the guard towers.

None of them had even heard of a thing like that before.\n\n"Can you put an entire house on it?" one of the foals asked and the soldier furrowed his brow for a second before nodding.\n\n"Sure can, probably."\n\n"Can you put the entire VILLAGE in it?!" another foal asked eagerly and the soldier shook his head.\n\n"Nah, the village is too big. It'd be wobbly and end up falling off." As he spoke, he used his hooves to demonstrate. The foals all nodded among themselves. That made sense. The soldier, meanwhile, scratched his cheek absently. "Hey... if you help us unload this truck, I'll see if we can give you a ride. Deal?" He had barely finished the sentence before the foals were clamouring over the wall to help out."

Instead he looked despondent, sighing as he wiped his forehead.\n\n"I understand what is going on here, and I do not want to be presumptive or dismissive... but why in Za'al's name is the federation building a secret police?"\n\n"I have no idea what you are speaking of, good Ozid." Zarishat sat calmly behind her desk, looking at him and wondered if he was about to start crying.\n\n"I also understand that secrecy is how these things are done, but I beg you, please reconsider! What you are building will not aid the revolution, it will choke it! A secret police will not inspire confidence, but fear. It will create an unaccountable shadow weapon that can be wielded with impunity by whoever controls it! Our authority is supposed to come from the will of the people, not the threat of being vanished in the night. This is the exact same kind of weapon that would have been used to chase us down back in Coltva, and even if it fulfils its purpose well initially, sooner or later it will be nothing but an instrument of repression, of tyranny, of authoritarianism! This is not what the revolution was meant to be!"\n\n"Thank you Ozid, I will take what you say under consideration. Now if you don't mind..."

"The most important thing you must know about this weapon is that it is semi-automatic! This means that it does not need reloading after you fire it."\n\nPutting the rifle down on the table, he took up the old familiar rifle they were used to, turning around and firing five shots downrange. Every shot was followed by the re-chambering movement they all knew like the back of their hooves, and the sergeant did it with expert speed and control. After finishing, he put the old rifle down, picking up the new and raising it. What followed left them all taken aback, as the sergeant just squeezed the trigger over and over, sending eight bullets flying downrange so quickly that it almost sounded like a machine gun. When he turned back, more than one soldier was gawking, and a couple were giddy at the idea of getting to try that new weapon.\n\n"Listen," the sergeant continued. "This weapon will fire much faster than any of you can re-acquire your target. When you fire this, you do NOT fire as fast as I just did. Fire one shot at a time, and re-acquire your target for every shot, is that clear!?""

We're at a position to secure our control over the nation fully, and I'm not going to throw that away to play nice with the reactionaries. Anycreature that's still fighting us has proven what their goals are, so offering them a way out will only leave us with future enemies. Track down our enemies and kill them all, there's not going to be any room for niceties now. Actually, no, pretend to accept surrender, but then kill them in secret.

At least enough so to put up with the process of getting through the darn security perimeter.\n\nAfter fumbling with his ID card within his coat, intentionally oversized to obscure his appearance and give him privacy, Zazarit gave it to the OARA guard who let him through into the Arabian sector. Buildings in the Sa'addle style replaced the Zonician realist structures, and horses in fancy robes contrasted the loyal OARA who stood guard. Anyone in here either had it in with Zarishat, or wasn't going to be here much longer.\n\nWeaving his way through the streets, Zazarit found his location, a sand brick building with purple cloth accenting the doorway. Entering inside, he trotted up a small flight of stairs before being hit with a wave of intoxicating smoke. On a cushion of purple satin in front of him was the Emir of Al'Nadieia, surrounded by a collection of three "companions," two mares and a stallion, wearing veils of the same purple.\n\n"Ah, my friend, welcome, have a seat!" the Emir said. Zazarit took him up on the offer, sitting down on a near-identical cushion on his side of the room, after which he was immediately approached by another stallion carrying a glass container full of smoke with a tube attached. Handing it to Zazarit, he took a puff and thanked the worker, who winked at him in return.\n\nTurning back to the Emir, Zazarit said, "I understand you wanted to talk about the deal?

A while ago, when she still drank, it would have given her a bleating headache and one heck of a temper, but she was beyond that now. Fully sober and entirely centered on what she was about to do. She had to suppress a chuckle. This was a memorial, after all, a memorial to her "holier-than-thou" brother and his legacy of reform and growth. But look where he was now. Down in the dirt, out of her mane, and not here to complain about all the changes she was making.\n\nIt took her a while to think of how to best honor him, but with all the economic reforms she was making, Zarishat started to savor just how much he would despise her for it. His revolution built on communal ownership and devolution of property, swiped out of his grasp by the sister he could never appreciate. Then, it had hit her like lightning.\n\nSpeaking clearly into the microphone, Zarishat began her speech, "Citizens of Zonicia! Look how far we have come! From the days of the revolution, we are more prosperous and more enriched, we are more educated in the ways of the revolution, and we stand above the slavers and masters that once held us down! But we can not forget what we have lost, my brave brother, Zeshmunazash, who died for our freedom to be won." Zarishat spoke about her brother through gritted teeth, her speech included a section praising specific things he had done, but seeing how she could barely stammer out calling him "brave," she decided it would be best to toss it.\n\n"Thus, I have come to declare the opening of a new memorial to his memory, a symbol of our economic progress, the new Kizil-Zeb foreign consulate!" Behind her, a red cloth fell, revealing the new titan of a building. The red hammer of the revolution towering imposingly above the entrance, interlocked not with a horseshoe, but instead a golden coin, a perversion of everything that scumbag of a brother stood for. Zarishat knew she couldn't call her new stock exchange what it was, but just knowing the true purpose of the beacon of moneymaking that stood in front of her gave her a warm feeling of joy, as well as heaps of irony."

From what I can tell, it's a very general term that is the combination of resources and the means to work those resources. But according to Marks, the combination of these productive forces and the application of labor is what creates the prosperity of communism."\n\nZarishat, already half asleep, waved the economist onwards. "Basically, it's a super general term that we can apply to almost anything, and we can do almost anything as long as we have a long enough explanation of how it creates productive forces. All I need is a blank cheque and someone really good at talking in circles until no one even cares what they are saying."\n\nZarishat stood up with a spring in her step, "Now that's what I like to hear!

A loud crack went off in the room. "So let us view our first accused, General Ozid?" As Zarishat finished her sentence, she looked up to the balcony to see six of Monzano's troops holding Ozid's body in their hooves.

The massive rally would be a strong show of force, a warning of what was yet to come for those who had earned her ire. Sometimes Zarishat wondered if the power had gone to her head, but in the end, she didn't care. There were bigger fish to fry.\n\nZarishat took a breath and cleared her throat, "Proletariat of Zonicia, I ask you, for what do we fight?" She paused. "I believe we fight for a few things, the advancement of socialism, the prosperity of our fellow creatures, and freedom from fear among them. But from where do all these challenges come? I believe they all have one source: the poverty of creatures, the lack of socialist freedom, the fear of a worse tomorrow, all of them. We can trace these plights back to the imperialist and capitalist powers holding down the common creatures, breaking their backs, and forcing them to become cogs in their exploitative machine. And I say no longer!"\n\nZarishat's voice began to hit a crescendo, and with it, the tension of the crowd rose as zebras started to stamp their hooves in agreement.

And most of all, the capitalist tyrants of Macawia, who, along with their culturally brainwashed lapdogs in Kása, claim to fight for freedom but only perpetuate the oppression of the proletariat. All of them shall fall!"\n\nThe hoofbeats now beat like thunder in Zarishat's ears, her voice, broadcasted by the speakers, echoing only slightly louder than the tide of rage.

Under this new 'Plan for the Reorientation and Expansion of the People's Economy,' the Ministry has conceived of several new initiatives to further our prosperity, first among these are the Four Modernizations-"\n\nZarishat looked around the room at those in attendance. As Zahummid droned on about economic data, there was not a single thought behind the eyes of the party delegates, all either bored out of their minds or soaking in his every word. Just how she wanted it.\n\nTo be entirely honest, Zarishat sometimes missed Ozid's furious pudgy face in the crowd, providing her with something to laugh at. But he was long gone. His lingering influence over the party was long gone, and nothing was left to stop her.\n\nTuning back into Azizelqart's rambling, Zarishat heard something about interspersed debt restructuring, and decided it was best just to zone out until it was her turn to talk again."

Yes, yes, this is what Monzano had been dreaming of for years! Standing atop a platform on a great iron beast of war, a new tank prototype from the wartime technology ministry, Monzano took a deep breath and smelled the air. Iron, rubber, fuel, and sweat. No better mix in the world.\n\n"Enjoying the scenery?" Monzano turned to Zarishat, who rode atop the tank with her. "I'll be honest Monzano, I don't feel very sure-footed on here, but I get why you like the adrenaline rush now. This does make me feel powerful!" The two friends laughed and went back to waving at the crowd, whipped up into a patriotic daze, the citizens of Hippone cheered and clapped like creatures possessed, all for their Paramount Leader and her most outstanding General.\n\nLooking around, Monzano saw one of her soldiers signal her from a rooftop, it was time. Turning to Zarishat, she whispered, "Ms. Big Shot, it's time. Point them to the skies." Zarishat nodded as the tank slowed to a halt and the parade with it. Both zebras turned around, and Zarishat pointed her hoof towards the sky above where the procession had come from, causing the crowd to gradually look with her.\n\nFirst with a rumble, then with a roar, a squadron of planes tore through the sky, leaving smoke behind them, faster than anything the people had seen. Monzano beamed with joy. She hadn't been sure if the first jet projects would be ready for the parade, but she couldn't be happier that they were. This was her dream come true, but dreams keep evolving, and Monzano wasn't done.\n\nAnd as the parade began to move once again, all the soldiers let out a cry of triumph;"

Taking a sip from her glass of sparkling grape juice, she mused about what brought her to this point. The weight that was her Za'al-forsaken brother had been taken off her shoulders, and from there, it was onwards and upwards.\n\nOf course, she had a lot of blood on her hooves, but she didn't care. She had proven them all wrong. No amount of blood spilled could measure up to that, her greatest triumph. She was no longer "the other Zeirutid sibling," she was Zarishat, Marksist revolutionary and Paramount Leader. The blood was worth it.\n\nHeh, blood. Red like her banners, red like her drink, and red like her ballgown, special ordered from Manehattan. She thought back to something Zeshmunazash had said to her years ago, that achievements built on blood crumble in the waves. But here was her island palace, built on blood, unharmed and unimpressed by the waves of the ocean.\n\nHe was an idiot to the end. She was the leader of one of the planet's most powerful nations and one of the richest creatures the whole world over. He could have never come close to this. He was a naive fool, and was now just made of the dust she stood upon.\n\nTap, tap, tap.\n\nTo the end of the hall she went, to a set of mahogany doors many times her height, and as they opened before her, she saw the greatest party in the world.

There would be a war, another one.\n\nBut Zarishat didn't care. This nation had done nothing for her. It had thrown her into the dirt, forced her into a life she didn't want to live, made her a fugitive and a soldier. If it wished to throw itself onto the blade of death, then so be it. She'd just give it a push.\n\nLeaving the balcony, she went to the game room where some aides were smoking and playing poker. Speaking to one of them, she said, "Well, I say the game's up. Get an air force plane. We're getting out of here." The zebras began to stand up and meander out of the room. They all knew this would happen by now, but they were stopped by Zarishat, "oh and, pack up the state gold reserve with us. We'll need it for our retirement funds.

Then on top of that, Zarishat kept insisting on going to her playzeeb mansion on that Za'al forsaken island.\n\nA thumping headache ran through her head, banging at the sides of her skull like something wanted to escape. Feeling like she needs to go lay down, Monzano is only brought back to reality when she hears a loud knocking on the door. She must've not heard it at first over her migraine. Opening the door, her aide nearly collapses at her hooves. He's exhausted.\n\n"General, the Sufrit has fled."\n\nThe pain got worse. No, Zarishat couldn't have abandoned her, she would never do that. Her skull throbbed. What about all their plans, the nation they would build together? Does she just not care? Her mind burned with anger and pain. No, stop kidding yourself Monzano. She never cared. She's a raging drunk who existed to spite her brother. You offered her friendship, and she threw it away. The pounding won't stop! Za'al damn her! To tartarus with her and all her lackeys! Make the pain go away!\n\nTrashing the office, Monzano threw everything she could reach into the fire. The maps, Zarishat's books, paintings, everything was already burning. What's a bit more? In her fit of rage, Monzano screamed, releasing all her pent-up fury, and then began to think. The beating subsided, and Monzano turned back to the aide, who was now cowering in fear.\n\n"Ozid will abandon us. Rally what's left of the army. I'll do this myself.""

Warlords were one thing, but warlords were the same as Zarishat, self-interested and disorganized. She was far more worried about Gerza.\n\nThat morning, she had gotten the news that Gerza had proclaimed a rival government in Trotkat. He claimed to be a constitutionalist, and some of the still-living remnants of that movement had joined him. But when Monzano looked at his files, she saw links to organized crime, mercenaries, drugs, and the technocrats. Some of the commanders she was hoping would join her had even pledged themselves to him. Who could she trust? Who were her allies? Sure, she was the theoretical head of state, the head of the military, and held the capital, but she was honestly just another warlord. She needed legitimacy, but it would take someone completely desperate to take her up on an offer. Someone disempowered multiple times, looking for any way back into power.\n\nMonzano shot up. The Zarcids. And maybe even those Harmonites who Zarishat constantly complained about being cowards and traitors. They wouldn't work with Gerza, and they might be able to see through him. She had to work fast. The war changed by the hour. And soon enough, the letters went out. Addressed to Zalathel Zarca and Jezabzella Zeshmid."

Squads of zebras in gas masks and black cloaks streamed out of camps in the forests, executing any who resisted. All avians shot on sight. Any government official was killed. These weren't warlord militias. These were real, trained soldiers. From Hippone to Zapsa, and even in Zeordu, these masked warriors unveiled purple banners and spoke of their leader, their prophet. The Star Father. How he would bring about a prophetized age of reckoning for the enemies of equinity.\n\nMonzano could barely believe it. Was this what Zarishat had brought upon the land? An age of strife unlike any other, where battles were not for political gain, but survival? Deep down, Monzano knew she was in over her head. But there was nothing left to do but fight. There were too many lives on the line for her to stop now. She may not be the greatest leader or the best general, but by Za'al above, she had to save Colthage.\n\n"General Monzano. Jezabzella has replied, she's willing to work with you. Zalathel and the Zarcas are already on their way."\n\nMonzano nodded. There was a chance. A slim chance, that she could save Colthage. If there was any point in her life where she truly needed help, it was now. So Monzano lowered her head, and said a short prayer for the first time in years.

Zeshmunazash thought to himself that it fit the situation almost too well as he stood on the floor of the senate, looking around himself with a sardonic smile. "So, where to now then, you wonder," he told his gathered advisors. They'd been on his case about what he planned to do now all day. Ozid, Zala, even Zarishat, all had been asking. "I guess we'll just institute a dictatorship. Can start purging the constitutionalists, mass execute the patricians, rob the nation blind, set fire to the jungles and then build a giant diamond statue of myself, unfurl my wings and fly off into space." His bizarre comment left the others taken aback, and it was Zarishat that spoke up after a while.\n\n"What, are you a pegasus now?"\n\n"No and I'm not a dictator either," Zeshmunazash sighed.

They should, no, they MUST, be made part of the plan, otherwise we're showing that the thousands of urban poor who have suffered just as much as the rural poor aren't part of our vision, and why should they support us then?!" Zala was pounding his hoof into the desk to accentuate his point and spoke with volume and zeal both. As Ozid spoke up, his soft voice stood in sharp contrast to his hardliner comrade.\n\n"While you are right, we need to remember its purpose. It is a land reform meant to alleviate the plight of the farmers, nothing more. The urban poor are better helped by new programs focusing on them, not trying to apply the Kizil-Zeb to things it was never meant for. It being a compromise is a strength, not a weakness, because we've already implemented it and seen that it works. Starting to meddle with it now will only cause discontent."\n\n"Nah, let's go with Zala's idea," Zarishat drawled sarcastically. "I'm sure all those still on the fence about us will LOVE seeing us go full Stalliongrad. That won't backfire at all."\n\n"There's already discontent," Zala persisted while ignoring Zarishat. "Why not simply take it all to its logical conclusion, before the reactionaries can reassert themselves? We risk them becoming too big a threat once again."\n\n"They can't turn on us if they don't have the common zebra on their side," Ozid retorted as he dabbed his brow with a hoofkerchief.

"As noble as the sentiment expressed is," the economist began. "I fear it may be overambitious at this time. The system is new to most farmers in the region, and we have pressing concerns to deal with here and now. Reviewing the matter with General Monzano, I would say that the best solution would be to parcel out the land to the farmers that already know how to use the land and offer them profitable contracts to get us bananas, and as many as they can."\n\n"Do we need to commit fully to either?" Jezabzella asked. "Why not simply set aside most of the area for the cooperatives, but allow private plantations to an extent?"\n\n"Not the least since they could serve as trial plantations for local initiatives or experiments," Ozid agreed. Zeshmunazash couldn't help but be amused by the sight of the glamorous patrician sitting next to the frumpy Coltvan, but pushed the thought aside.

"If the issue is starvation, give it to those most at risk, and let us avoid our people dying by us valuing 'the economy' over their lives. Is that not an obvious solution?"\n\n"Yes yes, you're very cute," Zarishat drawled. Her bleary eyes and raspy voice spoke clearly of what she had been doing last night.

"Oh, Zarishat dear, did you have any alternatives? Perhaps the wine helped you think of something?"\n\nZarishat's gaze could have melted stone, and Jezabzella's smile was angelic. Instead of exploding, however, she continued. "Use the damn grain to get those who still plan to fight to sit down and behave. Some provinces are hotbeds of resistance, and if we slip them some extra food they'll calm down and we'll stabilise the region. Economy or lives won't matter if we collapse when attacked."\n\n"Okay we'll end for the day," Zeshmunazash sighed.

I am not agreeing to anything by just showing up. I want to meet this so-called "Lion of the West." He may be a bandit, but he's been fighting the Colthaginians for years. Also, he's apparently been planning on some sort of land reform like the plan of Kizil-Zeb for years.

colthaginian_federation_2.11.d:0 "Approaching the compound was more stressful than Zeshmunazash thought it would be. Earlier, he had believed himself resigned to his fate, believing that this bandit had fought for a good cause. Now, it was a bit more nerve-wracking. Seeing the building in which they were to meet, he was confused. It was just a farmhouse, he had expected either a fancier building or some shack for them to meet. But this was a family farm, like his back home! Entering, he was hit with a pungent aroma. Was that... apples? \n\n"Ey, comrade! Over here!" Zeshmunazash turned to the noise, and looking to his left, he saw a truly shocking sight. A zebra lounged back in a rocking chair, a full mustache, and held what looked like a liquor bottle. "Don't just stand there, friend, sit, sit!" As Zeshmunazash began to step towards the table, the zebra flashed a smile at him and said, "Come on, I don't bite... often." before chuckling lightly. \n\nAs Zeshmunazash sat, an old female zebra entered the room from the side carrying a pie, the source of the apple smell. Becoming suddenly stiff, Zeshmunazash soon saw the old mare was not a fighter. Turning to the zebra, he said sarcastically, "Zidon, I thought we agreed on no other soldiers in the room." Zidon turned back to him and chuckled, "My dear friend, this isn't one of my soldiers. This is-" "I mean the pie does look lethally good," Zesh interrupted. Staring at him for a second, Zidon continued, "This is Mama Manzana, a charity worker. She is letting me use her farmhouse for our get-together. That's all." Smiling again, Zidon pushed a plate towards Zeshmunazash as well as a glass. "Drink, eat! We are meant to be friends here, no?" He then bent down beside him and picked up a thatch farmer's hat, placing it on his head, "I hope you didn't think this would be one of those boring political conferences." Zeshmunazash smiled, "I like your style Zidon. So tell me, why is a fighter like you talking to a politician like me. You revolted for years. Are you sure you're ready to put down the rifle?"\n\nZidon thought for a moment, then spoke, "Why would I fight when what I have fought for is already here? I've been fighting for years for my comrades and friends to get a fair shot in life. To work their land and live happy, content lives, and look where we as a nation are now! The oligarchs are gone, and I've read your plans many times. I really couldn't ask for more for the zebras of this land! So when you approached me, I was thrilled that I would get the chance to meet you. I don't want to fight anymore. I want to live."\n\nZeshmunazash smiled wide now, "Well, friend, let's get down to business first. Then, I'll gladly take you up on the drinks and pie." Zidon laughed loudly and fully, "Business first kind of zebra then? Alright, I can work with that. But I always open deals with a toast, so..." Filling the small glass with some of the amber liquid from his bottle, he pushed it back to Zeshmunazash, "A toast, to friendship.""

But Zeshmunazash needed a break, so into the black and white pages he went.\n\nStaring him right in the eyes was the scarred piercing eyes of the Lion of the West, Bandolier Zidon. Above him read the headline, "The Lion of the West denounces the National Unity Front." Reading the article further, Zeshmunazash saw immediately that the headline wasn't entirely genuine, Zidon had insulted him in some quite flowery language for his choice to work with the Governor of Tefemanei, but stated he understood why the government had made that choice. Zidon stated how he feared the revolution just becoming the old order in a new coat of paint, but he understood that he couldn't tell the future. So for the foreseeable future, he'd be retiring the revolutionary struggle, and requested to be left alone to live out his life.\n\nZeshmunazash closed the paper and put it down, had he made the right choice?

Everything flowed as usual in the halls of power, but normal is boring. Someone needs to shake things up a little. I think today, that someone will be me.\n\nZannido Zidon watched on from the upper balcony of the hall, drawing many curious glances from other citizens who had come to see the government work. He was quite the odd look, dressed in a nice suit with slicked-back hair, but still wearing his characteristic bandolier, without ammo, of course. He had arrived late, having to deal with some issues at home before he could make the trip, and had decided to watch the delegates work a bit first. After picking out Zeshmunazash in the crowd, Zidon got a sense of how these zebras played politics. "Well, time to get to work." he said to himself, "I can love the players and still hate the game."\n\nExiting the balcony, he made his way to the congress floor. Giving his bandolier to the security guard, he opened the doors to the chamber with a smile, drawing the attention of a few delegates nearby. His striking purple eyes drawing glances as he danced around the room, talking up the various representatives. Eventually, the speaker called the chamber to order, it was time to take a vote on the issues at hoof.\n\nWatching him from the other side of the room, Zeshmunazash smiled as he went to take his seat next to Ozid. "See, I told you this would work! He's a natural politician." Ozid shook his head, "that's what I'm afraid of as well. Who knows what type of measures he'll support!" Zeshmunazash chuckled and shook his head before he felt a tap on his shoulder, turning around to see the well-dressed Zidon; the zebra said to him, "Hey, Mr. Big Shot, mind if I sit with you?" Zeshmunazash nodded, and Zidon took his seat as a member of the Orthodox faction of the congress."

He definitely was a patrician, relatively young, and she glanced to Azizelqart to see if he had anything to say.\n\n"Hiram Zerranid," the zebra introduced himself. "Formerly of Hippone. With the recent changes, I decided that my talents might be better spent aiding the National Unity Front. When I heard that mister Zahummid had found kindred spirits here, it seemed like I had found my people. And I presume you would be Zarishat Zeirutid?"

We want a society where the common zebra participates and has a voice, a true voice and not the vain hope that a distant senator or patrician will take pity on them. And yet have we not gathered power under us, you ask. Have we not become rulers in our own right, who now stand atop Colthage?"

It was pure apathy that had caused him to stay home in the first election following the Storm King's invasion, and he really didn't have the time to care as the Zarcids ruled Colthage, or as the Coltvans rose up in revolution. Even when the new regime took power, Zaderzaal simply continued life as he always had.\n\nBut over the past few weeks, something had changed. The government had been putting up posters, helping set up rallies for people to get politically involved. Zaderzaal had seen people, Colthaginians just like him taking to the streets, demonstrating their support for the nation and its leadership. Supporting and opposing policies, giving their opinions on recent events or decisions... it was far from the Colthage he remembered.\n\nSo perhaps, it was finally time for Zaderzaal to do something. Of course, it wasn't still as simple as just going out and waving a flag or giving a few cheers. The factions that made up the NUF were very diverse, and advocated for very different directions when it came down to it. He hadn't really thought about who he agreed with yet, but now that he finally wanted to go out and be politically mobilized like everyzebra else these days, it was time to make a choice.

colthaginian_federation_2.28.d:0 ""You know, some are saying that we're trading one overlord for another," the Coltdarian's comment made Zeshmunazash raise an eyebrow.\n\n"They missed the part where we offered you to be autonomous?" he asked, the Coltdarian shrugging in response.\n\n"They don't think it's a sincere offer. Still, whatever they claim, it's still a better deal than what we had before."\n\n"But there are those who would rather see you become autonomous?" Zeshmunazash asked dryly, being given a nod in reply. "Look, is this going to explode into separatism the instant you're integrated? Because I need to know this. I'm not having conflict just because people were too awkward to tell me what's what."\n\n"No not really, people are overwhelmingly positive to integration, but if you so choose, there are many that would prefer autonomy."\n\n"Swell, so it's our call, eh?"

Zeshmunazash spoke to the gathered crowd, his comrades in the National Unity Front standing assembled around him. "Indeed, we must not. Our commitment to the ideals of self-determination and harmony will be tested, and we cannot promise you peaceful resolutions to all the challenges that await. What we can promise, however, is that we will not hesitate in the face of tyranny, and as the agents of imperialism try to force their fetters onto other peoples, we will be there to stop them!"\n\nThough the zebras of Hippone were their official audience, their actual such sat across the border. Whether Hippogriffs, Chiropterrans or any other force, Zeshmunazash knew that they had watched the NUF's proclamations with suspicion. That suspicion would likely become hostility now.\n\nSo be it then, freedom was not something he planned to start compromising on."

colthaginian_federation_2.30.d:0 ""Haha, thank you all! Thank you, thank you!" Zesh tried his best to shuffle away from the crowd as his bodyguards moved in to keep some semblance of order. The longer he stayed in power, the more this happened. He knew the people simply liked him and that they meant no offense, but he wished he could get some time alone.\n\nOne of his bodyguards nodded to him and smiled, "Enjoy your time off Zesh, you deserve it." Zeshmunazash smiled and began to walk down the beaten dirt trail towards his old estate.\n\nHe still felt terrible about sectioning it off, but every member of the National Unity Front insisted he keep it, his own private oasis. Only one other zebra was allowed on the property without his permission, and that was the maid, whom Zeshmunazash insisted he pay out of pocket. The other would have been Zarishat, but well...\n\nAfter around ten minutes of walking, Zesh arrived at the small cottage, the same one he grew up in. Going into the kitchen, he grabbed a frying pan, some greens, a bit of tofu, some spices, and made himself tacos for dinner. Grabbing a bottle of cider, he brought his food into his old bedroom, and lounged back on his bed, eating his dinner.\n\nThere were simple pleasures in simple things, and this was one of them. After everything Zesh had done over the years, nothing brought him more joy than just lounging back and enjoying himself, even if it was just for a bit. Bringing new life to Zonicia and beyond was great, of course, but Zeshmunazash was still a zebra, and he still had his needs. He had given everything for the nation, and the nation gave him back this short bit of relaxation, and he couldn't ask for anything more."

He gestured to the papers again as the diplomatic picked it up and fruitlessly tried to re-analyze, this time with noticeably less enthusiasm and tension. Ah, that old fashioned suspicion, from those that dabbled too much in petty triviality within those kingly courts; Zeshmunazash can only give an easy-going smirk before reaching for under the table and grasping a bottle of spirits, a gesture that rose an eyebrow from the hippogriff, who still had not a single complaint to offer.

Why is Ozid the one whom the old order finds it so easy to associate with? Is there something... peculiar about him?"\n\n"One second, Zanuzel," Zeshmunazash reached over, grabbing Zala's hat and pulling it down over his ears, hard. A choked grunt came from the general as he began to pull at the hat, trying to get it up over his eyes. "You'd have loved to purge them, I know. But you'll just have to deal with the fact that you have to work with people you don't like. That's been the deal from the start."\n\n"It's not a matter of liking," Zala finally got the hat up over his eyes and rubbed the bridge of his muzzle. "It's a matter of security. When an entire faction is made up of turncoats, can you trust them? You've let snakes close to your heart, and do you trust they won't act up?"\n\n"I trust you, don't I?" Zeshmunazash smirked. "Besides, if they try anything, Ozid will keep them in line. And don't give me your line on the inherent opposition of the worker and the elite, I know what you're going to say, and we're still going to make this work together. I never meant to be here, none of us did, and grasping for power by wiping away the opposition won't help. I'm not improvising a whole socialist revolution." Zala sighed at the comment and nodded."

Ahirom Zadadid rolled his eyes in response, ignoring Jazelid's impudent wink.\n\n"No, it wasn't, though I suppose she's quite the looker. I am actually corresponding with Mikhail Beakunin, and with recent—"\n\n"WHAT?!" The yell made Zadadid shy away from Jazelid, his hoof flying to cover his now ringing ear. Jazelid, meanwhile, looked like his eyes were about to pop out. "H-how did you... are you serious?" from impudent to incredulous, Jazelid's mouth hung wide open.\n\n"Yes?" Zadadid said, rubbing his ear. "And I just wrote to him, describing what we're doing here, and asked about what his experiences fighting for the revolution. What, you thought he would be too high and mighty to reply?"\n\n"No, it's just... it's Mikhail Beakunin! Along with Steel Stallion, he's one of the most important creatures to have lived in this last century! He defined much of what we're fighting to accomplish! I— I'm sorry, I'm babbling. Just, if you're able, then let him know I hold him in the highest regard. He's an inspiration." Jazelid nodded stiffly to underscore his words, and Zadadid's eyes twinkled with amusement.\n\n"And should I also ask if he'd be willing to correspond with a colleague of mine as well?" He asked mildly, watching how Jazelid's eyes almost popped out of their sockets."

colthaginian_federation_2.55.t:0 "The Dinner Party"
colthaginian_federation_2.55.d:0 "The dinner was going well, and Jezabzella enjoyed herself immensely. Ozid really was a zebra to enjoy life, and he had been showing off his appetite along with his sincere charm all evening. Her friends had taken to him as well, and at the moment he was regaling them with stories of their exploits in Coltva. It really was as good a dinner as she could have hoped for, and yet the best was to come. Her friends were incorrigible schemers, and she'd kept them away from her work with the NUF as she didn't trust them to play nice. Yet, after relentless requests, she had chosen to invite Ozid over, and they were currently doing their best to buy his affection with the best food and wine available.\n\n"Thank you all of you," Ozid said jovially as he rose up to speak. "This has been a wonderful evening, but I really must say a few words!" Her friends all applauded him and Ozid raised his glass high. "You will get nothing. I will not aid you in any efforts, and your attempt to ingratiate yourself with me will not be kept a secret! Thank you!" He emptied his glass with one swig, and it was first when he put it down that one of the others managed to speak up.\n\n"H-how dare you..." the zebra began, Ozid giving up a hearty belly laugh in response.\n\n"You do realize we could have hanged you all, right?" With those words, he brought the already indignant mood down to an absolute zero. "We were victorious, and we had only received violence and oppression from Colthage despite our modest demands. Your lives could have been forfeit if we had chosen to. But we, including your good friend Jezabzella, understand that the time has come for honest discussion, not scheming and plotting. So please don't try this again. Come to us honestly and openly, and then we can talk. Until then though, please kiss my flank, and my apologies for ruining this dinner, Jezabzella." He bowed his head to Jezabzella, turned around and left the room. Behind, he left a stunned collection of zebras and a Jezabzella that grinned like an idiot."
colthaginian_federation_2.55.a:0 "Told you it wouldn't work."

colthaginian_federation_2.56.d:0 ""You shouldn't be so camera-shy, you know," Jezabzella told Zeshmunazash as they all walked out of the meeting. "I know you're a humble zebra, but you're still the one that led Coltva to its current position. Surely you can see why at least a little more visibility would be a good thing."\n\n"Sure that it's not so your friends can have pictures of me on their bed stands?" Zeshmunazash clucked in an attempt to throw Jezabzella off her game, yet she only smiled.\n\n"I can think of a few, but believe me, if that was the goal I would have asked dear Zammo here." She put a hoof on Jazelid's shoulder, making him freeze up. "After all..." she indicated his appearance, "He knows what he is aiming for, and I must say, you do it quite well." Jazelid didn't reply, only blinking in confusion at her as he stood stock still. "Oh come now Zammo, don't play innocent. You do not look this dashing by accident, this takes effort, and the result is quite splendid.".\n\n"No, that's just how he dresses," Zeshmunazash offered, leaving Jezabzella to give Jazelid another look.\n\n"Oh you are just dangerous!" She grinned at him. "Still proves my point though. If my friends would have anyone on their bed stands, it'd be this dashing rogue." She gave Jazelid a wink as she passed him by with a sway of her flank, the fragrance of her perfume lingering. Zeshmunazash looked after her, then to Jazelid, who still couldn't move."
colthaginian_federation_2.56.a:0 "You know. I think she noticed."

colthaginian_federation_2.57.t:0 "Important But Tedious"
colthaginian_federation_2.57.d:0 ""Well, there's no two ways about it," Azarago sighed as he put down the papers. "Infrastructure maintenance isn't exciting. There's no grand battles or heroic trials of strength, just tedious routine checks and repairs."\n\n"You're telling me," Azizelqart nodded, "I've had way too much experience arguing with people that you can't just budget for building something. The word 'maintenance' might as well be Nimbusian to some people. You can't rally zebras with a grand speech to repair a bridge."\n\n"Or maybe you could?" Azarago scratched his cheek as he traded a look with Azizelqart. The two of them had been sitting in this room for hours, and they were both really tired. Chuckling, he cleared his throat and looked up at the ceiling before beginning to speak. "Comrades, brothers and sisters. Look around you, look at this monument to greatness, this great bridge our fathers and mothers built us! It is their legacy, handed down to us, and yet it is crumbling. Time, that eternal enemy, has worn away at it, but it has not won yet! Are we not our parents' children? Are we not carrying the lessons and the values they passed down to us? In all we do, we strive to be their equals, and should we not keep this place intact as well!? Shall we not, like them, hold together the roads and the bridges upon which our children will travel, maintain the great wheels of prosperity that keeps poverty and starvation from their door! Shall we not, as one nation, keep this great work intact?! In the name of our mothers and fathers, and for our children, to work!" At the end, he was standing up, one hoof raised as he roared at the top of his lungs.\n\nIt was in that moment that the door opened and Ozid peered inside to see Azarago halfway up on the table, hoof raised to the sky and holding the notebook in it almost like a sword. "...what's going on in here?" He asked, Azarago slowly getting down from the table."

colthaginian_federation_2.58.t:0 "A Difference of Philosophy"
colthaginian_federation_2.58.d:0 "If anything was going to turn Azizelqart into an alcoholic, it would be the Coltvans. He was overjoyed that Zeshmunazash, for all his quite 'brave' ideas, still had the wherewithal to listen to experts, and yet the groups clustering around him were varying levels of misguided, idealistic or just insane. He was happy there was at least one group that he could cooperate with to not have Colthage to wholly to pot, yet of these one was a militarist of the worst stripe, and the other was...\n\n"But suuure, that's definitely not gonna backfire at all. Seriously, whose flank did you kiss to get any jobs at all?" The other... was Zarishat. He was honestly amazed that someone could be this mean-spirited without choking on their own bile. Thoroughly undiplomatic, pathologically uninterested in understanding anycreature else and spiteful to the point that she rejected even her brother's affection despite the advantages it would give her. What a piece of work.\n\n"I do not know what to tell you. Insisting on oaths of loyalty will scare off those industrialists who are skilled enough to have options, and the single best indicator of a stable society will be economic progress. For that we will need the most talented, and they won't be receptive when they can find employment elsewhere without oaths of loyalty."\n\n"Weeh weeh weeh, the meanies don't want me to do whatever I want, weeeeeh," Zarishat drawled. "If they want to get a piece of the pie, they'll either kiss the ring or they can sod off to trade sand in Zarantia or something. I know you want to weasel your old friends back in, but that's not happening." Za'al above, he really wanted to tell her she'd never escape her brother's shadow and she'd die in it like the worm she was, but he instead took a deep breath before noticing Monzano's eyes twinkling.\n\n"This amuses you, doesn't it?" Monzano only nodded in response and Azizelqart massaged his temple."
colthaginian_federation_2.58.a:0 "I hate being the sole sane zebra."

colthaginian_federation_2.59.t:0 "A Friendly Game Of Chess"
colthaginian_federation_2.59.d:0 "Monzano smiled as Ozid put out the chess pieces on the table. Once a week she and him met to play chess and just disconnect from all the worries that plagued them. Drawing lots, they determined she would start and she made a move, pretending to be fully absorbed in the game as Ozid began to talk. His mind tended to wander at times like this. When his guard was down, a lot of things could slip out, and he always had thought that it all was in confidence.\n\n"And I don't know what to think of it all, really," Ozid admitted. "She has made it clear that she isn't going to make a move there. It's a shame in a way, they would have cut a dashing couple. I just hope the poor colt won't be too heartbroken by it."\n\n"Mhmmmm." He should have annoyed the everliving Za'al out of her. His soft-spoken ways, his casual, jovial appearance and more than anything, how he always had been one step ahead of her. Despite how hard she had worked, this bumbling horseapple had roly-polyed his way into not only the position as Coltva's finest general, but Zeshmunazash' closest confidante as well. And yet she hadn't ever found it in herself to really hate him. Maybe it was just working alongside Zarishat for so long, but she'd never been able to muster up that kind of absolute spite towards Ozid.\n\nAlas, as the match continued, she realized she'd forgotten to keep tabs on his rook. Ozid moved it forwards, capturing her queen and putting her in checkmate. She almost cursed but stopped herself, taking a deep breath and leaning back.\n\n"I think you get too single-minded. You had a good thing going with the towers, but you focused too much on it," Ozid suggested and Monzano sighed again, nodding slowly as she sat up properly. "Another game?"\n\n"Yes please." He was just too nice for his own good. She couldn't help but appreciate it. Still, that didn't mean she wasn't going to continue leeching information from him."

colthaginian_federation_2.60.t:0 "An All Too Usual Morning"
colthaginian_federation_2.60.d:0 "The stench of alcohol was almost overwhelming as Zeshmunazash walked into the house with a slow shake of his head. Over a dozen bottles on the table, but where was... of course. He sighed as he looked at the dishevelled, passed out form of his sister where she lay on the sofa. Picking up some of the bottles, he began taking them out to the kitchen, as well as pouring out the bottles that weren't already drained by the sponge in the other room. A few minutes later, when he was almost done, a groan came from Zarishat in the living room.\n\n"Right. You're here," she said as she noticed him, and Zeshmunazash put down the last bottles. He leaned against the counter and nodded against the empty bottles behind him. "What? Just another day in the victorious revolution... What do you want?"\n\n"Zari." Zeshmunazash stopped, feeling so resigned. How many times had it been at this point? "You can't keep doing this, Zari. I can't remember the last time I saw you not hungover or drunk, and it's killing you. We're achieving so much right now, but at this pace, I don't know if you'll even be alive to see it completed!"\n\n"Please just shut your trap", Zarishat groaned. "I'm still doing my job and still going to your meetings. So what if I want to wash away the headache your gaggle of idiots gives me with a drink or two?"\n\n"They're not 'my meetings', we're doing this together, you are part of it too, so why..." Without warning, Zarishat got up and walked out into the bathroom. Soon, retching sounds came from it and Zeshmunazash covered his face with one hoof."
colthaginian_federation_2.60.a:0 "What am I supposed to do with her?"

colthaginian_federation_2.61.t:0 "A Line Cut Short"
colthaginian_federation_2.61.d:0 "She was just about to hit the point where she was happy with how drunk she was. All that remained after that was continuing until she didn't remember anything. At least here in the depths of the alcohol she didn't have to care about all the meddling flankholes that surrounded her. Or so she thought, at least until there was a knock on the door. She ignored it first, taking another swig of alcohol only to have the knocking continue, relentlessly, and she swore as she stumbled to her hooves and walked over to the door.\n\n"What?!" She snapped as she opened the door, only to see somezebra vanishing around the corner further away. Stumbling after, she was already furious and ready to beat whoever it was in the face with her bottle. Yet as she crossed the corner, she came face to face with the barrel of a gun.\n\nThe gunshot rang out, and Zarishat fell backwards, feeling how she suddenly couldn't breathe. In panic, she turned around and tried to run, only to stumble and fall to the ground. She crawled, trying to get away, but the assassin came up behind her and grabbed her by the mane.\n\n"Nothing personal, you're simply not useful any longer." The voice was smooth, yet muffled by something, a gas mask? Two more shots rang out and Zarishat went limp."
colthaginian_federation_2.61.a:0 "She was found the next day, her face shoved into an anthill."

colthaginian_federation_2.62.t:0 "A Brother's Grief"
colthaginian_federation_2.62.d:0 "Ever since his sister's death, Zeshmunazash had been paralysed with grief. Though the assassination was being investigated, there were precious few leads, and it all seemed like it was a revenge killing of some kind. He just could not follow that train of thought to its end. He had hoped for so long that his Zari would be able to get her issues under control, that she'd rise above that damned alcohol and become the zebra he remembered from their youths, the young mare who he had battled wits with every day and whose acerbic wit had sharpened him into what he was.\n\nYet now it would never happen... Zari was gone, and around her life moved on, leaving her behind. Even the other Pragmatists were moving on, her last friends reorganising around that Hipponian scholar Hiram Zerranid. The mere thought of that had left Zeshmunazash irrationally angry, and he had half wanted to grab Hiram and beat him up until he admitted his role in her death.\n\nBased on what? His own grief and rage and need to find someone guilty, nothing else. Zeshmunazash forced himself to remember that, yet the mere idea that Hiram would touch Zari's position was more than Zeshmunazash could bear. He had lost his sister, and like dust, all that was left of her was scattering to the wind. All the hopes and possibilities for her life had crumbled, and all that she was and had been was fading before his eyes. Za'al he would give anything to have her back... Just to talk to her again, to tell her one last time how much she had meant to him instead of having it all end like this!"

### Leader Descriptions ###
CVA_ZESHMUNAZASH_ZEIRUTID_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 5th of January, 964 in Kizil-Zeb\n\nBorn to a family of well-off farmers, Zeshmunazash Zeirutid seemed to many to be destined for greatness. A highly intelligent and charismatic young zebra, he excelled in school and could have risen high, maybe even raise the Zeirutid family up among the patricians. It could have happened, were it not for his persistent and uncompromising need for fairness.\n\nHis parents had instilled in him a belief in helping your neighbours, and when local landlords began to seize the farmlands in the region, Zeshmunazash were among those who protested the seizures. As 'legal' as they might be, all he saw was a distant senate who did not listen to its people, and let greedy landowners run roughshod over them. As it turned out, the landowners had enough power to not only have the protests violently dispersed, but also brand the organisers as criminals. At eighteen years of age, Zeshmunazash became an outlaw, and fled into the wilds. Harsh action provokes a strong reaction, however, and Zeshmunazash became determined to bring down the corrupt landlords with whatever means necessary.\n\nThough there may be strong similarities between him and figures like Steel Stallion and Filip Redglad, Zeshmunazash has never quite bought into the mainstream socialist ideas, and instead has created his own brand of the revolution. He still believes Colthage can be saved, but not as long as the Zarcids hold sway, and not as long as the elites are allowed to do as they please. He did not want to become an outlaw, and he did not want to be a leader, but that is the price to pay so that his fellow farmers can grow their crops without fear of being driven from their homes, then he'll happily pay it.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Sesek"
CVA_ZARISHAT_ZEIRUTID_DESC:0"§YBorn§!: 8th of April, 966 in Kizil-Zeb\n\nZarishat could have had it all, had it not been for her older brother's need to try to save the world. As a talented student with a knack for building useful connections, she had arranged everything for her career in Colthage where she would work for a member of the Zarcid family. It would have been her springboard to wealth and recognition, had not Zeshmunazash ruined everything with his need to challenge authority.\n\nAfter Zeshmunazash became an outlaw, Zarishat's future fell apart before her eyes, and it was not long before the authorities came looking for her as well. Though her brother bailed her out, Zarishat never forgave him, nor did she ever forget what she lost thanks to him. As part of the Liberation Army of the East, Zarishat's ambition found some distractions as she refused to not get involved, but though she earned her place, she ended drinking heavily when she realized she would likely never become anything more than a simple criminal stuck in her brother's delusional crusade.\n\nZeshmunazash dying was the only good thing her brother had ever done for her, as she found herself in a position to seize control over the LAE and finally, for the first time in many years, turn the path of her life the way she wanted it to go.\n\nZarishat could have had it all, and with her brother out of the way, she may have it yet."

### Pure ideology ###
CVA_dengism_desc:0 "Also known as Zarishat Zeirutid Thought, Zeirutism describes "socialism with Zonician characteristics", an ideology that seeks to adapt Marksism to the socio-economic conditions of Zonicia. It advocates pragmatism above all, and sees an open market economy as vital for modernization and economic growth while still maintaining the supremacy of the ruling party. Its detractors call it a blatant form of state capitalism that can hardly be considered true socialism."

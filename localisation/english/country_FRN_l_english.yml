 ### Foci
 FRN_crisis_in_wingbardy:0 "Crisis In Italy"
 FRN_crisis_in_wingbardy_desc:0 "Ever since the brutal Falcor War, Italy has been in various degrees of turmoil. Now the infamous fascist, Guilio Beakolini, is preparing a march on Rome while communists riot on the streets. We are closely tied to Italy, but the fate of our ally stands on the edge of a knife. Yet all we can do is wait and hope for the best."
 FRN_allies_not_subjects:0 "Allies, Not Subjects"
 FRN_allies_not_subjects_desc:0 "Long have we been Italy's friends, but in recent decades this relationship has turned increasingly sour. Italian companies dominate Francistrian economy, Italian culture overwhelms any native traditions and, worst of all, the troubles of Italy affect us directly. Francistria must distance itself without angering its powerful ally."
 FRN_cooperate_with_socialists:0 "Cooperate With PSA"
 FRN_cooperate_with_socialists_desc:0 "Partito Socialista Agrario, the agrarian socialist party, has always opposed Italian influence and protests the rise of fascism. Count Francis thinks their ideas align with his own and considers asking for their assistance. This must be kept secret from the nobility and the blackwings of LPF, for they despise leftists."
 FRN_dismiss_wingbardian_advisors:0 "Dismiss Italian Advisors"
 FRN_dismiss_wingbardian_advisors_desc:0 "While the aid of Italian advisors is appreciated, it cannot be denied that their influence on our economy and military has grown too great. Instead of relying on Italian investors to fund our economy and Italian officers to manage our army, we must learn to fly with our own wings."
 FRN_nationalize_businesses:0 "Nationalize Italian Businesses"
 FRN_nationalize_businesses_desc:0 "Italian control over our economy needs to be curtailed. Local companies are unable to compete with foreign-owned behemoths such as Taloniel, which in turn drain money away from Francistria. PSA has proposed that we nationalize these companies, transferring their assets to state-owned ones. Francis has also decided to compensate the foreigners."
 FRN_independent_army:0 "An Independent Army"
 FRN_independent_army_desc:0 "During the Falcor War the Francistrian army cooperated very closely with the Italian one; so much so that it almost merged into it. However, in the end it is the army of Francistria and not of Italy. Our military command does not need to follow Italian orders and we should not rely on Rome to dictate our strategy and doctrine."
 FRN_defensive_doctrine_focus:0 "Adopt A Defensive Doctrine"
 FRN_defensive_doctrine_focus_desc:0 "During Francis VIII's reign, Francistria went on daring offensives several times. The end result? Unruly conquered land and a dead Count. Francis IX has no interest in replicating the military escapades of his predecessor. From now on, Francistria will focus on defending its borders. How, exactly, will soon be decided."
 FRN_meet_with_talonuel:0 "A Meeting With The King"
 FRN_meet_with_talonuel_desc:0 "The recent actions taken by the Count have not pleased our ally, the King of Italy. If we wish to avoid being kicked out of the Roman Pact, or worse, face direct intervention from Italy in our internal affairs, the Count must meet with the King and mend our divides."
 FRN_protectionist_policy:0 "Implement Protectionist Policies"
 FRN_protectionist_policy_desc:0 "Lady Bianca has long complained that her companies cannot compete with cheap Italian imports. Our own industry cannot grow for every domestic demand is already filled by foreigners. Clearly action must be taken to nurture the growth of our industry. Temporarily imposing tariffs and import quotas will limit the amount of foreign goods on our market."
 FRN_hire_condottieri:0 "Hire Condottieri"
 FRN_hire_condottieri_desc:0 "In the past, Francistria used to have a strong mercenary tradition, its roots being in Count Francis I's own motley band of adventurers and sellswords. While modern conscripted armies made most mercenaries obsolete, the Falcor War proves what a senseless waste of citizenry's lives war can be. We should once again hire mercenaries to train our troops and to die for us."
 FRN_school_in_every_village:0 "A School In Every Village"
 FRN_school_in_every_village_desc:0 "The previous Counts cared little for the education of the commoners. Count Francis IX knows however that we will remain a backwards nation until we ensure as many griffons as possible attain basic schooling. With the support of the PSA, he is now preparing a large-scale public project to establish a school in every settlement with over 250 inhabitants."
 FRN_minimum_wage:0 "Introduce Minimum Wage"
 FRN_minimum_wage_desc:0 "Cheap labour has long attracted Italian companies to exploit our workers while low wages mean most of our working populace is impoverished. Mario Vicino of PSA has advised Count Francis IX to implement laws to set a limit on how low wages can be, forcing employers to pay their workers fairly. This will reduce exploitation and increase the wealth of the commoners."
 FRN_import_substitution:0 "Import Substitution Industrialisation"
 FRN_import_substitution_desc:0 "Francistria has long been reliant on imports due to primarily producing raw goods for export such as grain and wine. With tariffs increasing price of foreign goods, we need to subsidize our own nascent manufacturing sector and invest in promising businesses. All this, along with improved education providing skilled workers, should gradually industrialise our nation."
 FRN_invest_domestic_arms_industry:0 "Invest In Domestic Arms Industry"
 FRN_invest_domestic_arms_industry_desc:0 "Italian arms dealers have long supplemented our army with weapons of war, but we should not be so reliant on another country to provide for our troops. Instead, we should aim to be militarily self-sufficient. This can be achieved by expanding our own arms industry by expanding arsenals and investing in our own companies."
 FRN_polytech_uni:0 "The Polytechnic University Of Eatela"
 FRN_polytech_uni_desc:0 "Cooperating closely with Lady Bianca, Count Francis IX is preparing to open a new educational facility in Eatela, specialised in educating a new generation of engineers. Many teachers have been hired both from Francistria and abroad. They will ensure we will no longer have to rely on Italian engineers to do everything for us."
 FRN_land_reform:0 "Limited Land Reform"
 FRN_land_reform_desc:0 "PSA has for many years now advocated for a comprehensive land reform, but the nobles of the Arengo have been uninterested. Now, with support from the Lady and the Baron, Count Francis IX can fulfill their wish and redistribute land from aristocrats to peasants. Of course, the nobles will retain most of their lands, but PSA and the commoners will be pleased nonetheless."
 FRN_aid_veterans:0 "Aid The Veterans"
 FRN_aid_veterans_desc:0 "Those griffons who bravely fought in the Falcor War were afterwards neglected by the government. This motivated many of them to join LPF, which provided them generous support. Now it is time we regain their loyalty by offering far greater aid than the LPF could ever afford to provide. We will remind them that their heroism has not been forgotten."
 FRN_fortify_borders:0 "Fortify Our Borders"
 FRN_fortify_borders_desc:0 "While most of our borders are for now secure, who knows what may happen in the future. The enemy may not just come from the north, but from the south as well. If we prepare now, we won't have to prepare later when it might already be too late. Extensive fortifications will be built on our borders to guard against any threat."
 FRN_invite_foreign_experts:0 "Invite Foreign Experts"
 FRN_invite_foreign_experts_desc:0 "We should not just look for talented individuals within Francistria or Italy. By looking further, into other countries, we may find griffons - or even other creatures - who are eager to work for us and provide our Count with good advice. The LPF, of course, won't be pleased, but the Count cares little for their opinion nowadays."
 FRN_francistrian_identity:0 "Revive Francistrian Identity"
 FRN_francistrian_identity_desc:0 "Ever since Count Francis II befriended Italy, there has been a continuous effort to "wingbardize" Francistrian lands. In reality, the griffons of our nation had a distinct identity separate from that of Wingbardians and it could be argued that our dialect is closer to Tarrinian than anything else. We are not Italian and do not want to be Aquileian, so let us be Francistrian!"
 FRN_blood_of_martlewings:0 "Blood Of The Martlewings"
 FRN_blood_of_martlewings_desc:0 "Count Francis IX has long felt like he is not a true Martlewing. But it cannot be denied that the blood of his ancestors flows in his veins. Deep inside him is buried a proud warrior with a strong will. Lately, this has become more and more evident as the Count's confidence grows. Now, he wishes to learn martial matters and participate in our army's leadership."
 FRN_develop_roameo:0 "Develop Roameo"
 FRN_develop_roameo_desc:0 "The Barony of Roameo is by far the most backwater and underdeveloped region in Francistria. So far we have allowed Baron Dante to mismanage the area as he pleases, but no more. Count Francis IX has decided to invest extensively into Roameo to drag it out of poverty and backwardness. Baron Dante should be pleased, his subjects even more so."
 FRN_engineer_corps_focus:0 "Establish Engineer Corps"
 FRN_engineer_corps_focus_desc:0 "The construction of new fortifications required us to employ many engineers, who now wish to continue to serve the County. Therefore Francis IX has decided to form a new branch of the military comprised entirely of engineers. They will be responsible not only for constructing defences, but also bridges and camps, as well for demolishing structures and clearing terrain obstacles."
 FRN_restore_count_authority:0 "Restore The Count's Authority"
 FRN_restore_count_authority_desc:0 "Francistria was always an absolute monarchy and the word of the Martlewings was always law. This only changed with the death of Francis VIII. Now, his confidence constantly growing, Francis IX has finally decided to limit the power of the Arengo and regain his rightful authority in the County. The nobles will once again be relegated to an advisory role. Long live the Count!"
 FRN_a_proposal:0 "Propose A Marriage"
 FRN_a_proposal_desc:0 "So far our Count has lacked a consort and has ruled the country by himself, with aid from advisors. But he should marry, not only to have someone by his side, but also to secure his bloodline. The succession crisis that followed the death of Francis VIII must not happen again. Fortunately, Count Francis IX already has the perfect griffoness in mind. All that remains to be done is to propose."
 FRN_peasant_militia:0 "Form Peasant Militias"
 FRN_peasant_militia_desc:0 "Mario Vicino of PSA has proposed that we provide arms and basic training to the peasantry of our country, so that they can participate in defence against possible invaders. The rural nobles, of course, are not fond of this idea, but at this point they are powerless to stop Francis IX, who is in favour of arming the peasants."
 FRN_talk_to_angry_bird:0 "Talk Sense Into LPF"
 FRN_talk_to_angry_bird_desc:0 "The LPF keep protesting the Count's decisions, complaining about almost everything he does. Count Francis IX has run out of patience, but instead of using force, he has decided to use words. A private meeting will be arranged between the Count and the leader of the LPF, Gherita Zarfatti. Perhaps he can manage to make them realize the error of their ways."
 FRN_frexit:0 "Frexit?"
 FRN_frexit_desc:0 "Despite our best attempts at diplomacy, Italy continues to attempt to exert its influence over us. While we have been allies for centuries, perhaps it is finally time to end it, to safeguard our precious sovereignty. We can still retain cordial relations as long as [WNG.GetLeader] is reasonable. However, it is dangerous to go alone, so Count Francis IX must consider carefully."
 FRN_curtail_privileges:0 "Curtail Noble Privileges"
 FRN_curtail_privileges_desc:0 "The numerous nobility of Francistria has enjoyed exclusive privileges even before Count Francis I's conquests, which placed them above fellow griffons. They have traditionally been exempt from taxation, have special rights in commerce and ownership and so on. Social mobility was hampered and our development stagnated. Now, Count Francis IX has decided to bring an end to this injustice."
 FRN_the_counts_speech:0 "The Count's Speech"
 FRN_the_counts_speech_desc:0 "For the first time during his reign, Count Francis IX has decided to hold a public speech addressing the nation. It will be broadcast on radio to every household that owns one and will concern the future of the nation. It remains to be seen if the Count can keep his stutter under control during the speech, however."
 
 FRN_trust_in_wingbardy:0 "Trust In Our Friends"
 FRN_trust_in_wingbardy_desc:0 "We have been Italy's trusted allies for centuries, even before the rise of the Empire. While our relationship is not perfect, we have vowed to stand by their side no matter what happens. In return, we expect them to aid us as much as we aided them. The Roman Pact is a reciprocal alliance. All we need to do is ask, and we shall be given anything we want."
 FRN_request_help_from_knights:0 "Request Help From The Knights"
 FRN_request_help_from_knights_desc:0 "The Knights of the Trinity are an order sworn to protect the practitioners of their unorthodox faith. However, they also loyally serve the Count in return for his patronage. Their efforts during the Falcor War were valiant, but now in this time of instability we need them once again. We should persuade the Count to ask for their assistance."
 FRN_consult_wingbardian_advisors:0 "Consult Italian Advisors"
 FRN_consult_wingbardian_advisors_desc:0 "Italy has generously provided us with talented griffons who are eager to improve the economy and the military of our nation. Instead of sidelining them, we need their valuable advice if we wish Francistria to become a fully functional modern nation. They shall guide the Arengo (and the Count of course) and help them draft sensible policies."
 FRN_cooperate_with_companies:0 "Collaborate With Talonieli"
 FRN_cooperate_with_companies_desc:0 "Talonieli is a major Italian company specializing in manufacturing tools and making steel. In recent years they have expanded their operations into Francistria, opening several steelworks in the capital. We should seek to work together with them directly and subsidize them, allowing them to open new factories and supply our nation with tools and machinery."
 FRN_expand_military_cooperation:0 "Expand Military Cooperation"
 FRN_expand_military_cooperation_desc:0 "Ever since our independence from the Empire, we've worked closely together with Italy on the matters of military. We stood side by side during the Falcor War and learned a great deal from that harrowing experience. Italy's army has modernized rapidly in the years since and we have fallen behind. We need to deepen our cooperation if we wish to be on par with our allies."
 FRN_eliminate_trade_barriers:0 "Eliminate Trade Barriers"
 FRN_eliminate_trade_barriers_desc:0 "Viscountess Ippolita has long demanded the removal of any remaining tolls and restrictions on trade with foreign countries. She has greatly enriched her lands already by exporting food, so her desire is understandable. Not only that, but our economic advisors say that free trade is the key to quick economic growth. Therefore we should minimize government interference on commerce."
 FRN_county_parliament:0 "Establish A County Parliament"
 FRN_county_parliament_desc:0 "With the encouragement of both Italian advisors and Knights of the Trinity, Count Francis has decided to propose the establishment of a semi-democratic bicameral parliament, based on the one Italy has. This should appease those calling for more democracy in the nation while also keeping much of the power in the claws of the nobility."
 FRN_wingbardian_doctrine:0 "Adopt Italian Doctrine"
 FRN_wingbardian_doctrine_desc:0 "There is no doubt that the army of Italy is far more advanced and powerful than ours. Instead of trying to come up with our own stratagems, we should just follow the leader. In this case, the leader of the Roman Pact. They will surely share their knowledge of the art of war and in return we will continue to faithfully support them on their military campaigns."
 FRN_wingbard_investments:0 "Attract Italian Investors"
 FRN_wingbard_investments_desc:0 "Italian businessgriffs have plentiful capital and are always looking for profitable ventures to invest in. We should encourage them to funnel their money into our nation, which would stimulate our economy and give them generous returns on their investments. Thus we shall arrange meetings between our representatives and the Wingbardians so deals can be signed."
 FRN_buy_back_goldenfeather:0 "Buy Back Goldenfeather Mines"
 FRN_buy_back_goldenfeather_desc:0 "About 60 years ago, large tracts of the sparsely populated hills in northern Goldenfeather were sold to Italian prospectors. Soon after, they happened to find sizeable deposists of various ores, most importantly iron ore and chromite. Mines were opened by Italian state companies and have operated there ever since. But perhaps it is time Goldenfeather returns to our claws?"
 FRN_influx_of_scientists:0 "Influx Of Italian Scientists"
 FRN_influx_of_scientists_desc:0 "For years now, scholars and teachers have been migrating away from Italy due to their outdated education system and a lack of funding. So far they have avoided [Root.GetNameDef], but perhaps we can convince some of them to come to us instead by offering them high pay and good conditions. Their expertise would be a great boon for our underdeveloped nation."
 FRN_joint_army_exercise:0 "Joint Army Exercise"
 FRN_joint_army_exercise_desc:0 "We have agreed to hold a military exercise together with the Italian army. Preparations are already being made for a large-scale war game that will take place near Tarrin. This will provide valuable experience for our troops while also ensuring their combat readiness. It will also improve military cooperation between our two nations."
 FRN_grant_land_to_knights:0 "Grant Land To Knights"
 FRN_grant_land_to_knights_desc:0 "The Knights of the Trinity have served us well so far. To reward them for their service and to ensure their continued loyalty to the nation, we will transfer crown land into their ownership, especially in areas populated by Trinitarianists. Under their wise management, the conceded land shall soon prosper."
 FRN_volino_trade_school:0 "Open The Volino Trade School"
 FRN_volino_trade_school_desc:0 "Cooperating closely with Italian educators, the government is working to open a new vocational school in the city of Volino. It will be designed to provide education for technical skills needed for many demanding jobs, thus providing us with a skilled workforce. Most of the teachers will be Italian, though perhaps in the future we will be able to have [Root.GetAdjective] ones."
 FRN_deal_with_wng_arms:0 "A Deal With Italian Arms Companies"
 FRN_deal_with_wng_arms_desc:0 "Our own production of military equipment is not sufficient. However, we can look to our allies for help. By signing contracts with Italian materiel manufacturers, such as Greda, we can increase our own production and improve the quality of our armaments. This way we can more easily supply our army with everything it needs, so we can provide better assistance for our allies."
 FRN_develop_goldenfeather:0 "Develop Goldenfeather"
 FRN_develop_goldenfeather_desc:0 "To truly see how developed a nation is, look at the countryside, not the cities. Goldenfeather is the primary rural region, exporting food for Italy, so its development would be beneficial for the entire country. Viscountess Ippolita has made sure to pull the right strings to pour enough funds into this project, so now it's a matter of getting griffons to work."
 FRN_end_personality_cult:0 "End The Personality Cult"
 FRN_end_personality_cult_desc:0 "Ever since the reign of Francis I, whose ego rivaled the Griffonian Empire in size, the Martlewing dynasty has built up a personality cult where the Counts were seen as divine monarchs who could do no wrong, which justified absolute power. With the reign of Francis IX, most griffons stopped taking the personality cult seriously. Therefore, it serves no purpose any longer."
 FRN_embrace_wingbard_culture:0 "Embrace Italian Culture"
 FRN_embrace_wingbard_culture_desc:0 "Long before the arrival of the Aquileian Martlewing dynasty, the griffons of Piumont were part of the Italian cultural sphere, strongly influenced by the bygone age of Karthinia. Our ties with our southern brothers have only grown closer over the centuries, to the point where our cultures and languages are near indistinguishable. Let us officialize Italian as our language!"
 FRN_temple_schools:0 "Expand Temple Schools"
 FRN_temple_schools_desc:0 "Temples have traditionally provided education for the common populace, who have been unable to afford education from elsewhere. However, they have so far lacked resources to provide their services to everygriff. With government funds and the aid of the Knights of the Trinity, this should no longer be a problem. Some more secular organizations will be displeased, but it won't matter."
 FRN_tarrin_line:0 "Build The Tarrin Line"
 FRN_tarrin_line_desc:0 "With unrest brewing in Tarrin and the possibility of Aquileia attempting to regain their lost region, there is no guarantee that we will hold it. Therefore we should construct a defensive line on our border with the Tarrin region, to prevent any future Aquileian incursions into our heartland. Of course, the line itself is not impenetrable, but with the aid of our allies it shall hold."
 FRN_honor_veterans:0 "Honour The Veterans"
 FRN_honor_veterans_desc:0 "Many soldiers fought and died bravely during the Falcor War. We cannot allow their sacrifice to be forgotten! A new holiday called Veterans Day will be established, during which military parades will be held in honour of the veterans of our nation. We will encourage the common griffons to venerate and glorify those who have fought in war, so they too may be encouraged to join the army."
 FRN_cement_alliance_marriage:0 "Cement Our Alliance With Marriage"
 FRN_cement_alliance_marriage_desc:0 "While our ties to the fellow members of the Roman Pact are close, they could be made even closer. There is an easy way to do so, too, as our Count is still unmarried. If we arrange a political marriage with one of our allies, we can not only create a stronger bond between our monarchies, but also gain a spouse to aid our Count."
 FRN_integration_or_self_reliance:0 "Integration Or Self-Reliance?"
 FRN_integration_or_self_reliance_desc:0 "While cooperation with Italy has indeed proven to be very beneficial for us, there have undeniably been some disadvantages from it as well. However, this does not mean we need to abandon Italy. Instead, we can either integrate our nation into the Italian sphere, or open negotiations and, with the aid of Italy, become able to fend for ourselves."
 FRN_bersaglieri:0 "Bersaglieri Training"
 FRN_bersaglieri_desc:0 "The Italian Bersaglieri are a renowned and old special forces regiment. They function as mobile light infantry, being able to move rapidly by having as little equipment as possible and using their wings to glide over rough terrain for hours. They usually fight like skirmishers but can assume the role of shock troops if need be. Suffice to say, their expertise could be useful to our soldiers."
 FRN_expand_knight_ranks:0 "Expand The Ranks Of The Knights"
 FRN_expand_knight_ranks_desc:0 "The Knights of the Trinity are dedicated to defending Francistria, but they are too few in number to make a meaningful contribution to our defence and need new members. Thankfully, there are many griffons who are eager to join their ranks. The Order simply needs our support to be able to afford training and equipping all these new recruits."
 FRN_draft_constitution:0 "Draft A Constitution"
 FRN_draft_constitution_desc:0 "The lower classes are not content with the little power they've been given. Now they agitate for the empowernment of the parliament and the limiting of the powers of the Arengo with a formal constitution. The anti-Italian nobles of the council now see their chance to strike back and declaw the Arengo, so it can no longer push through policies which displease them."
 FRN_francis_the_humble:0 "Francis The Humble"
 FRN_francis_the_humble_desc:0 "Once the Counts were absolute rulers, but now the opposite is true. Due to the actions of the Arengo and with his own approval, the authority of Count Francis IX has eroded into almost nothing. He is now little more than a ceremonial leader, but the country needs a proper head of state. With Arengo's support, the Count's final act is to appoint the Grandmaster as Protector of the Realm."
 FRN_concessions_to_flnt:0 "Enter Peace Talks With FLNT"
 FRN_concessions_to_flnt_desc:0 "It is clear to us that the violence in Tarrin will not end unless we express our willingness to resolve the matter peacefully. We will enter negotiations with the terrorists and try to seek a solution that makes both sides happy. Of course, opening talks with FLNT means recognizing their legitimacy, but that will likely please the local populace more than anything."
 FRN_union_with_wingbardy:0 "Union With Italy?"
 FRN_union_with_wingbardy_desc:0 "Ties between [Root.GetNameDef] and Italy have grown very close over the years, to the point where the border between the nations has practically ceased to exist. Pro-Wingbardians are now advocating for joining the Italian nation, justifying it by shared culture and friendly relations. Perhaps they are right that becoming part of Italy is good, but some disagree..."
 
 FRN_for_the_fatherland:0 "For The Fatherland!"
 FRN_for_the_fatherland_desc:0 "Our patriotic coup was successful, the rule of the corrupt Arengo has been ended and a military regency shall now be established. Under our guidance, our nation will be saved from decay and degeneracy. Messages have already been sent out to Italy, informing the founding father of fascism of our accomplishment. May Italy and Francistria grow ever closer under our rule!"
 FRN_wingbardy_is_not_yet_lost:0 "Italy Is Not Yet Lost"
 FRN_wingbardy_is_not_yet_lost_desc:0 "No matter what happens, the spirit of Italy will live on, and we will bear the torch of the nation if need be. As long as we live, we shall fight for a free Italy, standing bravely against oppression, liberalism and communism! Only in death does our duty end."
 FRN_patriotic_fervour:0 "Patriotic Fervour"
 FRN_patriotic_fervour_desc:0 "Citizens of Francistria! The fate of our beloved fatherland is at stake! We call for brave volunteers to join our fight so that we may prevail against the accursed enemy. Every griffon matters! Defeat is not an option in this fateful struggle."
 FRN_blackwing_militia:0 "Mobilize Blackwing Militia"
 FRN_blackwing_militia_desc:0 "Blackwings of LPF are a paramilitary organization, but they are more than willing to fight if called to arms. They have enough training and equipment to be useful in frontline battles, so we must mobilize them quickly, before the enemy overruns us entirely."
 FRN_open_up_caches:0 "Open Weapons Caches"
 FRN_open_up_caches_desc:0 "LPF has been preparing for such an apocalyptic conflict for a long time. Secret stores of weapons are hidden across the nation, waiting for the time of need. Now that time has come, so we can open the stores and equip our soldiers with much-needed guns and other equipment."
 FRN_dream_of_risorgimento:0 "A Dream Of Risorgimento"
 FRN_dream_of_risorgimento_desc:0 "Rome has been liberated and the Kingdom of Italy shall now be restored. But this alone is not enough. All Italian-speaking lands must be united under the purple banner, so that our nation can know true unity. But for now, let us celebrate our hard-earned victory and restore order in the lands of Italy."
 FRN_unite_talouse:0 "Unification With Talouse"
 FRN_unite_talouse_desc:0 "The mountains of Talouse has allowed the small and stubborn Duchy to retain its independence for centuries. But with modern technology, even mountains aren't much of an obstacle any longer. We shall march west and finally reunite with our cousins in Talouse, finally bringing them into the Kingdom of Italy proper."
 FRN_unite_falcor:0 "Unification With Falcor"
 FRN_unite_falcor_desc:0 "Falcor is an age-long rival of Italy, despite sharing the same culture. This nonsense must end now! Falcorians are Wingbardians, whether they like it or not. Their pitiful resistance must be crushed so our nations can know unity and peace at last."
 FRN_unite_arantiga:0 "Unification With Arantiga"
 FRN_unite_arantiga_desc:0 "Arantiga is small but feisty, retaining their strong martial tradition. Some griffons in the country identify more as successors of the Arantigan Kingdom, but that is true for all Wingbardians, as our tribe rose from the ashes of the old kingdom. Arantigans are no less Italian than the rest of us, so they must join the nation as well."
 FRN_dream_realized:0 "A Dream Realized"
 FRN_dream_realized_desc:0 "At last, after all these centuries, the disparate countries of Wingbardians are no more. Now all Wingbardians can now live happily under the waving flag of their fatherland. This was all thanks to the valiant efforts of Gherita Zarfatti, the hero of the Kingdom, who bravely led our soldiers in the campaign to unite Italy. A single nation, a single culture, a single future!"
 FRN_a_puppet_count:0 "A Puppet Count"
 FRN_a_puppet_count_desc:0 "While the County of Francistria is nominally under our control, we need to maintain legitimacy by keeping the Count in his position. However, we need to strip him of any remaining power, so he does not cause any trouble for our reign. Thankfully, the Count is very easy to persuade. As long as he signs any document we present to him, we'll leave him alone."
 FRN_replace_the_arengo:0 "Replace The Arengo"
 FRN_replace_the_arengo_desc:0 "The corrupt and inefficient Arengo was a flawed institution which only made our country weak. We have therefore already disbanded it, but a new government needs to be established quickly. Inspired by Beakolini's ideas, we shall establish a fascist council. Its members will be appointed by [Root.GetLeader] and will be second only to the leader in power."
 FRN_subjugate_the_nobles:0 "Declaw The Nobility"
 FRN_subjugate_the_nobles_desc:0 "Some of the nobles aren't exactly pleased with our takeover. Worse still, while the nobles have been pushed out of government, they retain their wealth and societal influence. We can weaken then fairly easily however: By forcefully seizing some of their property we dampen their economic power, and by redistributing it to the poor tenants of nobles we will erode their societal power."
 FRN_national_syndicalism:0 "Fascist Syndicalism"
 FRN_national_syndicalism_desc:0 "Francistria largely failed to industrialize due to leeching nobles and capitalists. By establishing national trade unions, we will protect the working class and make them subject to the state, allowing us to directly manage production rates. This will also diminish the influence of communism. Eventually, state-owned factories shall be managed entirely by the national trade unions."
 FRN_status_of_trinitarianism:0 "The Status Of Trinitarianism"
 FRN_status_of_trinitarianism_desc:0 "Trinitarianists have lived in Francistria for a long time, practicing their own variant of the griffon faith in peace. However, this was under the rule of the Martlewings. Now that we fascists are in charge, we need to decide about the status of this potentially dangerous religious minority."
 FRN_order_discipline_hierarchy:0 "Order, Discipline, Hierarchy"
 FRN_order_discipline_hierarchy_desc:0 "These three words are the foundation of LPF's policy. We will have order instead of chaos, discipline instead of cowardice and hierarchy instead of anarchy. This is especially true in our army, which has been weakened by neglect and overt dependance on our allies. It is time we apply our policy into the armed forces and weed out weakness from it."
 FRN_tripartism:0 "Tripartism"
 FRN_tripartism_desc:0 "With national workers' unions established, we can implement tripartism as our economic policy. Agreements shall be negotiated between trade unions, employers and the government. This way business and labour will be directly tied to state policy, allowing closer cooperation between the corporate organizations and bringing harmony amongst social classes."
 FRN_anti_communism:0 "The Red Menace"
 FRN_anti_communism_desc:0 "Mario's bands of unruly peasants have terrorized the countryside ever since we took power, clashing with blackwing squads. Something must be done about this unrest before more of the peasants and workers join Mario's movement and threaten to take over. However, there is no consensus in the party on how to deal with them, so a meeting will soon be organized to decide what to do."
 FRN_anti_knight:0 "Vox In Excelso"
 FRN_anti_knight_desc:0 "The knights claim to be loyal servants of the Count, yet they oppose our takeover which freed the Count from the claws of the nobility. They were already difficult to trust because of their heretical religion, but now it is clear they are in fact traitors. The Order of the Trinity must be stopped before it is too late and the knights attempt to overthrow our rightful rule."
 FRN_nationalize_arms_industry:0 "Nationalize Arms Industry"
 FRN_nationalize_arms_industry_desc:0 "Military industry is too vital for national security to be left in the untrustworthy claws of industrialists and capitalists. By bringing various private enterprises under direct state control, we can repurpose and expand facilities to fulfill the needs of our army directly. We will, of course, offer some compensation to the previous owners."
 FRN_productivism:0 "Strengthen The National Economy"
 FRN_productivism_desc:0 "Economic growth is the key to making our country stronger. With increased production, we can lay the groundwork for full modernization and regeneration of society. Restructuring of the tax system coupled with government interventionism where needed should increase our growth rates, along with tariffs imposed on imported goods."
 FRN_fascist_welfare:0 "Union Welfare"
 FRN_fascist_welfare_desc:0 "Making union membership mandatory for all workers would be unpopular if we did not offer something in return. By offering various state-sponsored benefits, pensions, insurances, recreational programs etc. we will make the public not only accept compulsory union membership, but welcome it. The opponents of fascism will also reconsider their opinion when they see us caring for the common griffons."
 FRN_indoctrinate_youth:0 "Indoctrinate The Youth"
 FRN_indoctrinate_youth_desc:0 "The older generations might be sceptical of fascism, but the minds of the youth are open to new ideas and more easily molded. All textbooks shall require authorization by LPF, all teachers must be party members and education must be reformed to glorify the nation. Attendance in schools will also be strictly enforce and young griffs will be taught to respect authority without question."
 FRN_expand_blackwing_militia:0 "Expand The Blackwings"
 FRN_expand_blackwing_militia_desc:0 "The blackwings are the paramilitary branch of LPF and PNF, having so far been a vital asset for our party's ambitions. Now that we have secured control of the government with their aid, we can invest resources into expanding their ranks and improving their training. In future conflicts, we hope for them to fight alongside regular soldiers against a common foe."
 FRN_adopt_arantigan_doctrine:0 "Arantigan Art Of War"
 FRN_adopt_arantigan_doctrine_desc:0 "The Arantigans were long the masters of warfare and in the ancient days they forged a mighty kingdom with fire and steel. This kingdom was the predecessor of the Roman state and thus all heirs of Karthinia should look to Arantiga as their founding fatherland. Their disciplined army should be an inspiration for our own army, a model to be closely followed."
 FRN_national_council_of_experts:0 "Establish The Council Of Experts"
 FRN_national_council_of_experts_desc:0 "To improve the efficiency of our economy, a council consisting of economists, engineers, scientists and other experts shall be established to guide economic policy of the state. With their knowledge, the state can take a larger role in managing the economy instead of relying on market forces or selfish industrial magnates."
 FRN_national_university:0 "Open The National University"
 FRN_national_university_desc:0 "Located in Francistria City, the new tertiary education facility will be the torchbearer of civilization in backwards Francistria. Many fascist intellectuals have already been invited to work there as professors. They will preserve the integrity of our national spirit through the cultivation of the ingenuity of our nation and the refinement of our culture."
 FRN_anti_partisan:0 "Form The SAP"
 FRN_anti_partisan_desc:0 "Our experience with the well-organized bandits of the FLNT has motivated us to establish the SAP, Squadre Antipartigiane, as a detachment of the army. It will be tasked with rearguard operations, territorial pacification and anti-insurgency campaigns. Its ranks will be filled with the most battle-hardened and fearless members of the Tarrin garrison, who will use any methods possible to suppress resistance."
 FRN_modernity_and_tradition:0 "Modernity And Tradition"
 FRN_modernity_and_tradition_desc:0 "Under fascism, we can attain a perfect synthesis of the past and the future, of progress and conservatism. Technological advancement is seen as vital for national greatness, yet traditional societal values do not erode and thus do not make way for degenerate liberalism, equality and democracy. With the strength of fascism, may our monarchy last forevermore!"
 FRN_artist_patronage:0 "Patronage Of The Arts"
 FRN_artist_patronage_desc:0 "The culture of our nation is in dire need of revolutionary change to reflect our changing society. Those artists who do not dwell in the past or explore degenerate ideas need to be supported and encouraged to do more, to express the inner soul of the nation on canvas. This fascist art will embrace the world of tomorrow while seeking to surpass the achievements of yesterday."
 FRN_murderize_verenia:0 "Secure The North"
 FRN_murderize_verenia_desc:0 "Verenia was, for many years, an unstable region wracked by a civil war between pretenders to the throne. Now the region stands alone, while Aquileia, the Empire and other imperialist powers look on their rich lands hungrily. We cannot allow Verenia to fall into foreign claws as it would endanger our northern frontier. No, we must take swift action and seize the region ourselves!"
 FRN_fascist_mysticism:0 "Fascist Mysticism"
 FRN_fascist_mysticism_desc:0 "Fascism should not limit itself to the realm of politics, but extend beyond into the spiritual. The doctrine of the Duce, Beakolini, is the absolute truth and none should question it. The Duce embodies the griffon spirit which trancends the individual and binds nations together. The Idol of Boreas was once a symbol of this spirit, but now the infallible Duce shall replace it."
 FRN_home_of_the_wingbards:0 "Homeland Of The Wingbards"
 FRN_home_of_the_wingbards_desc:0 "Historical record makes it clear that Wingbard tribes invaded the old kingdom of Karthinia from the north. Where else could've they come from, if not from lands now known as Francistria? Clearly, we are the true Wingbardians, more pure-blooded than our southern siblings. We need to promote this truth and make it widely known, so our citizens can be proud of themselves!"
 FRN_question_of_identity:0 "Clash Of The Titans"
 FRN_question_of_identity_desc:0 "Tensions between two leading figures of LPF, Gherita Zarfatti and Vittorio Felice, have reached a breaking point. While before they were willing to cooperate and negotiate, now the two can barely tolerate one another. The party itself is divided on who to support, so this dispute must be ended for the sake of unity. It will be resolved in the fascist way: With violence."
 
 FRN_rise_of_the_downtrodden:0 "Rise Of The Downtrodden"
 FRN_rise_of_the_downtrodden_desc:0 "Long have the common peasants of Francistria faced oppression from their masters. But revolutions in other parts of the world have opened our eyes. Why should we continue to suffer if we can take up arms and earn our liberty through victory or death? And so, led by Mario Vicino, we peasants broke out of our cages and now fly free under the sun."
 FRN_shoot_knights:0 "Harrow The Knights"
 FRN_shoot_knights_desc:0 "The Knights of the Trinity are well-meaning, but are also monarchist loyalists and heretical fanatics. Any possible negotiations with them are impossible as they staunchly resist our rule. If they stand against us, then they stand against the griffons of Piumont! We will send our militias to their chapter houses and drive as many of them out of our country as possible."
 FRN_shoot_nobles:0 "Slash-And-Burn The Nobles"
 FRN_shoot_nobles_desc:0 "The nobility are vile leeches and vermin, growing fat from the exploitation of the peasantry. Our movement was founded to oppose them, and now that we are in power, we will have no mercy. The mistreatment of centuries must be paid back in full within a month. Let the blue blood of the nobility water our thirsty fields!"
 FRN_shoot_fascists:0 "Weed Out The Fascists"
 FRN_shoot_fascists_desc:0 "Fascists may have socialist influences, but there is no doubt that they are our worst enemies. They have always demanded the Count and his government to suppress us and have conducted violent raids against our gatherings. Their influence over the army is considerable, too, so if we do not deal with the fascists swiftly, our revolution will fail. Let's kick the fascists back to Italy!"
 FRN_collectivize_all_property:0 "Collectivize All Property"
 FRN_collectivize_all_property_desc:0 "Private property is the antithesis of the traditional peasant way of life. In Piumont, village communities used to share the property and manage it jointly, before the rise of the avaricious nobles who hoarded land and wealth like dragons once did in the mountains of Tarrin. Now we shall return to tradition by returning all property to collective, communal ownership!"
 FRN_promote_tradition:0 "Promote Traditional Values"
 FRN_promote_tradition_desc:0 "The commoners have gone astray during the misguided modernization of our nation. We need to remind them of the good old days, when instead of nuclear families there was the support net of an extended family that could take care of offspring and when capitalistic hedonism hadn't corrupted every griffon. Above all, we mustn't abandon our faith in the three Gods and their Archons."
 FRN_rural_communes:0 "Rural Communes"
 FRN_rural_communes_desc:0 "The countryside will be reorganized into semi-autonomous village communes, which share ownership over land. The communes will be encouraged to strive for self-sufficiency and produce what they need, ceding any excess production to others in exchange for anything they need. Mines will be communalized as well, but their production will be nationalized, so the mining communes don't grow too wealthy."
 FRN_abolish_money:0 "An End To Money"
 FRN_abolish_money_desc:0 "The peasantry did not traditionally use money and usually paid taxes to the Count in the form of produce. Money was an urban invention created by greedy merchants. Piumont has no need for such a fabricated symbol of wealth. Real wealth is in products that have a use. Instead of confusing ourselves with stocks and banks, we can instead focus on maximising our production of goods."
 FRN_out_with_the_old:0 "Out With The Old, In With The New"
 FRN_out_with_the_old_desc:0 "The officers in the army cannot be trusted to remain loyal to our new government. The command structure of our military must be rebuild from the ground up and the army as a whole needs to be reorganized as well. We will deal with the old leadership in a fitting way and promote new commanders from among the peasantry. This is the first step in the creation of a proper army of the commoners."
 FRN_return_to_countryside:0 "Return To The Countryside"
 FRN_return_to_countryside_desc:0 "Citizens, abandon the corruption and parasitism of city life! Go back to where you came from, to the peaceful and idyllic countryside, far from the capitalistic hustle and bustle of urbanity! There is plenty of land to spare now that individuals can no longer hoard it for themselves. Industry will be moved too, with machinery spread out amongst the villages."
 FRN_peasant_assembly:0 "Peasants' Representative Assembly"
 FRN_peasant_assembly_desc:0 "The nation is in need of a new legislative body, so the old government can be completely dismantled. For this purpose the Peasants' Assembly shall be established, a unicameral legislature consisting of 250 members. Majority of the seats will be reserved for peasants and the rest for workers and soldiers. PSA will be the only legal party and members of the assembly will be appointed by it."
 FRN_tear_down_judicial_system:0 "Tear Down The Judicial System"
 FRN_tear_down_judicial_system_desc:0 "The old courts were largely in control of the despicable nobles and corrupt judges. We will do away with the whole rotten structure. Justice will be delivered by peasant courts and the army. Thus, judicial power will at last be returned to the common griffons, while greedy swindlers will no longer be able to escape justice with their wealth and power."
 FRN_purge_heretics:0 "Purge The Heretics"
 FRN_purge_heretics_desc:0 "Some fools claim that Trinitarianism is a traditional Piumontese faith. This is nonsense. While Trinitarianism has existed here for a long time, it was always a persecuted minority faith, with most of the populace worshipping the gods as separate. Why do they think the Knights of the Trinity were founded? This age-old persecution shall now continue. We will break the strength of the knights."
 FRN_deindustrialization:0 "Deindustrialization"
 FRN_deindustrialization_desc:0 "The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the griffon race. The entire system was built on capitalism, on profit-seeking, on maximising profits. The constant need for growth and the squalor of urban life are breaking down society. What else could've caused the Revolution of 978? We need to go back before it's too late. Griffons do not belong in cages, they should fly free!"
 FRN_cleansing_of_bad_elements:0 "Cleansing Of Bad Elements"
 FRN_cleansing_of_bad_elements_desc:0 "Even after the crushing of the nobility and other enemies of our revolution, we continue to face opposition against our rule and our mission to save Piumont. These bad elements of society must be removed like cancerous tumours from an ailing body. Only then can we hope to accomplish our tasks."
 FRN_revolutionary_army:0 "Revolutionary Army Of Peasants"
 FRN_revolutionary_army_desc:0 "The rebirth of our armed forces is nearly complete. Now the army will not be an instrument of oppression or a hotbed of political ideas, but rather a true army of the common griffons. Its soldiers are motivated to defend their homes and liberate fellow commoners, its officers are exclusively drawn from the lower classes and recruitment standards have been lowered so almost anyone can join."
 FRN_educate_peasantry:0 "Education For The Peasantry"
 FRN_educate_peasantry_desc:0 "For too long were the common griffons kept ignorant, so they would not realize how bad their conditions were. To truly liberate the peasants, they need education to unshackle their minds. They must become class conscious and realize that the upper class wants nothing more than to oppress and rob them. Learning to read is important, but it is even more important to indoctrinate all peasants."
 FRN_repurpose_cult:0 "Repurpose The Personality Cult"
 FRN_repurpose_cult_desc:0 "The Martlewing Counts constructed a cult of personality around their dynasty, so the clueless commoners would regard them as demigods who could do no wrong. While any signs of this cult have been erased, there is no reason not to reuse it for the leadership of PSA. Mario Vicino is the exemplary peasant who led our liberation. Thus, we should follow his example and obey his wisdom."
 FRN_every_peasant_a_soldier:0 "Every Peasant Is A Soldier"
 FRN_every_peasant_a_soldier_desc:0 "This is the nation of peasants, and peasants are bound to the land. Therefore every peasant must be willing to die in defence of their land! Our military doctrine must be revised to take account of the increased size of potential soldiers within it, as in times of war every peasant will be expected to do their part in the battle."
 FRN_turn_back_the_clock:0 "Turn Back The Clock"
 FRN_turn_back_the_clock_desc:0 "The reversal of industrialization is almost complete. Cities are emptying and the countryside is once again teeming with life. The damage of modernity is slowly but surely being undone, though scars will remain on the land for many years to come. In the meantime, the former urbanites must re-learn how to live a humble and modest life on the countryside. They must adapt, or they will perish."
 FRN_end_of_hierarchy:0 "The End Of Hierarchy"
 FRN_end_of_hierarchy_desc:0 "Every griffon who could've claimed superiority over others has been dealt with. Every griffon who resisted this change has also been dealt with. No one is richer than others, yet no one is also poorer than others. Now we can finally have peace and equality under the wise guidance of our leader, Mario Vicino. Our revolution has been secured from within."
 FRN_breadbasket_of_south:0 "Breadbasket Of The South"
 FRN_breadbasket_of_south_desc:0 "Piumont was always a notable agricultural producer, especially thanks to the fertile lands of Goldenfeather. Now that our economy has agrarianized fully, we have more rural workers than ever before, and after initial famines can now expect to have enough surplus food for trade. We can exchange our produce for foreign goods and services, allowing us to thrive despite lacking an industrial base."
 FRN_socialist_dialectics:0 "Socialist Dialectics"
 FRN_socialist_dialectics_desc:0 "Just because our society is agrarian, does not mean we have to remain backwards in the field of science. Thankfully, some of our fellow socialists abroad are intellectuals and could thus be willing to share their expertise with us. Not only that, but by engaging with dialogue with other brands of socialism, we strengthen our bonds with the international movement."
 FRN_institute_of_agronomy:0 "Open The Institute Of Agronomy"
 FRN_institute_of_agronomy_desc:0 "The next step in our process of revolutionizing the intellectual field of our society is the foundation of a new research institute, dedicated to agricultural sciences. Here, research will be conducted on increasing our crop yields, dealing with pests, managing the environment and innovating new uses for plant-based products."
 FRN_keepers_of_peace:0 "Keepers Of The Peace"
 FRN_keepers_of_peace_desc:0 "As we expand the scope of our fight against capitalism and modernity, we need to ensure a tight grip in territories outside of our own country. For this purpose, the Keepers of the Peace shall be established as an anti-insurgency organization dedicated to rooting out reactionary resistance to our revolution. All methods will be allowed in this fateful struggle against the bourgeoisie."
 FRN_torchbearers_of_peasants:0 "Torchbearers Of The Peasantry"
 FRN_torchbearers_of_peasants_desc:0 "Urban intellectuals do not know what is best for the rural peasants. They cannot claim to be leaders of the socialist movement in southern Griffonia! That title belongs to our glorious leader alone. Only he can lead our revolutionary army to liberate the oppressed peasants of the south. All we must do is follow his command, and victory will be ours."
 FRN_liberate_neighbours:0 "Liberate Our Former Allies"
 FRN_liberate_neighbours_desc:0 "The monarchy of Francistria was once allied with the equally tyrannical regimes of Talouse and Arantiga. The new Piumont has no interest in respecting such agreements. Even if local revolutionaries had been successful, they are far too unorthodox to be considered proper communists. Now they are without the protection of Italy while the local peasants yearn for freedom. What are we waiting for? To war!"
 FRN_increased_yields:0 "Increase Crop Yields"
 FRN_increased_yields_desc:0 "Maximising the production of food has been one of the main goals for our party for a long time, but now we finally have the means to accomplish this. The Institute of Agronomy has drafted a plan to dramatically improve productivity. It will require digging irrigation channels, increased use of machinery, more efficient crop rotation, widespread use of fertilizer and so on. The peasants must get to work at once!"
 FRN_unconditional_divisions:0 "Unconditional Divisions"
 FRN_unconditional_divisions_desc:0 "To secure the rule of Mario and the PSA, an elite military formation of peasant soldiers shall be formed. They will be truly professional soldiers, loyal only to Mario himself, and will live in isolated military colonies to protect them from outside influence. In return for their service to the nation, they will receive free rations from the peasantry."
 FRN_great_liberation_war:0 "The Great Liberation War"
 FRN_great_liberation_war_desc:0 "Peasants of Italy! Your oppression under the rule of the southern cities is soon coming to an end. Peasants of Falcor! After this one final war, your tyrannical monarchs will no longer drag you into bloody conflicts, because they will be dead. Griffons of the south! The cancer of capitalism is finally being cleansed from our region. Our little corner of the world will soon be a true utopia."
 FRN_agrarian_paradise:0 "Agrarian Paradise"
 FRN_agrarian_paradise_desc:0 "Our dreams are becoming reality, despite what the naysayers claimed. We revolted against the modern world and emerged victorious! Now we can peacefully build an agrarian socialist utopia in southern Griffonia, where peasants have been freed from oppression and where every griffon is finally equal. Greed is a thing of the past. Now, we may enjoy the serenity of rural life."
 
 FRN_guardians_of_francistria:0 "Guardians Of [Root.GetFrancistriaName]"
 FRN_guardians_of_francistria_desc:0 "The County has been dissolved, but as his final act Count Francis IX granted the Order of the Trinity complete control of the nation. Now, it is our duty to establish a new, more democratic government and draft a plan for wide-spread reforms to address societal and economic issues in the country."
 FRN_promises_to_the_peasantry:0 "Promises For The Peasantry"
 FRN_promises_to_the_peasantry_desc:0 "The impoverished peasants of the countryside might not directly support the communist PSA party but they nonetheless admire its leader, Mario Vicino. This is because so far he has been the only one who has their interests genuinely at his heart. However, if we promise reforms to the peasants while actually having the power to implement them, Mario's support will rapidly erode."
 FRN_religious_coexistence:0 "Religious Coexistence"
 FRN_religious_coexistence_desc:0 "[Root.GetFrancistriaName] has always been home to two religions: Trinitarianism and mainstream Archonism. Often, they have been at odds, but the efforts of the Martlewing Dynasty have proven that they can exist side by side in peace. By officializing the status of Trinitarianism as the second faith of the nation, we are simply confirming what was already true."
 FRN_disband_blackwings:0 "Disband The Blackwings"
 FRN_disband_blackwings_desc:0 "Political paramilitary organisations cause nothing but instability and are a threat to peace. The fascist Blackwing hooligans are attempting to wage low-level war against the government instead of even trying to use more peaceful methods to advocate their policies. As such, paramilitary groups that aren't under government control must be banned unconditionally."
 FRN_full_land_reform:0 "Comprehensive Land Reform"
 FRN_full_land_reform_desc:0 "Land is very unevenly distributed in [Root.GetFrancistriaName], with most of it being owned by a tiny minority of nobles. This has been a major problem for a long time and one of our first goals should be to resolve this. We will redistribute excess land to peasants with full compensation for nobles, grant state-owned farms to smallholders, revise ownership laws etc. etc. etc."
 FRN_arrest_giacomo:0 "Arrest Mario Vicino"
 FRN_arrest_giacomo_desc:0 "Mario has worked hard to agitate the peasantry, but thanks to our land reform, his support has almost entirely collapsed. The peasants no longer see any need for Mario's radical and dangerous ideas, as they all now have their own land to till. Therefore we can now arrest Mario for his crimes without facing any backlash. His days of causing trouble are now over."
 FRN_foundations_of_a_republic:0 "Divine Democracy"
 FRN_foundations_of_a_republic_desc:0 "The Trinity - or as the Archonists think, Boreas, Eyr and Arcturius - made griffons as equals. Of course, some griffons may be smarter or stronger than others, but in the end all griffons have only one superior - or three, as the Archonists think. Only those with divine mandate, such as Grover I, are allowed absolute power over others. No other griffon has such right!"
 FRN_reform_the_army:0 "Reform The Armed Forces"
 FRN_reform_the_army_desc:0 "The army of [Root.GetFrancistriaName] has outdated structure and organization, yet because of reliance on Italy, it was never properly reorganized into a proper modern fighting force. As knights, we think it is of utmost importance to have a capable army that can fulfill its duty of defending the nation effectively. As such, we will closely guide the reformation of the army."
 FRN_meet_with_nobles:0 "Negotiate With The Nobility"
 FRN_meet_with_nobles_desc:0 "The aristocrats of [Root.GetFrancistriaName] have been very influential ever since the death of Count Francis VIII. There is no doubt some of them see our new government as a threat to their personal power. We should enter talks with the most powerful nobles, ex-members of the Arengo, and see if they can be reasonable. They could be useful allies, or a threat to our stability."
 FRN_changing_of_the_guard:0 "Changing Of The Guard"
 FRN_changing_of_the_guard_desc:0 "The general staff of the [Root.GetAdjective] army has been infested with Italian puppets, fascists and war criminals. For claiming to be such patriotic individuals, they have caused nothing but trouble in their homeland. We need to fully reorganize the officer corps and appoint new leaders for the army, who are loyal to the Gods and the country without a shadow of a doubt."
 FRN_distributism:0 "Distributism"
 FRN_distributism_desc:0 "Both capitalism and socialism are equally flawed and misguided ideologies. The gods intended for all griffons to satisfy their desires of acquisition equally, yet they never asked for the freedom of ownership to be restricted. The right to property is a fundamental right of the griffon soul. We will redistribute property of all kinds from the few to the many, spreading out wealth evenly across society."
 FRN_learning_the_holy_texts:0 "Learning The Holy Texts"
 FRN_learning_the_holy_texts_desc:0 "The Order of the Trinity has always believed that to truly be faithful, griffons must be able to read the sacred texts on their own, instead of just listening to the interpretations of the priests. This is why literacy has traditionally been high among the Trinitarianists. Now, the same can be true for the Archonists as well, so we will establish reading classes across the nation."
 FRN_expand_curriculum:0 "Expand The Curriculum"
 FRN_expand_curriculum_desc:0 "So far commoners have only been taught basic, necessary things in school, such as reading, writing and mathematics. This is clearly not enough to make civilized, conscious citizens capable of participating in a democratic society. We will extend the breadth of education by introducing new subjects such as economics, social science, history, theology and more."
 FRN_priests_in_the_ranks:0 "Priests In The Ranks"
 FRN_priests_in_the_ranks_desc:0 "A soldier gets little motivation from an officer barking orders at him. But a devout griffon holding a rousing sermon can make even deserters eagerly join the fight against a wicked foe. Having priests in the military would greatly improve the morale of our soldiers and make them continue fighting even if victory is unlikely, out of pure zealous determination."
 FRN_defenders_of_the_weak:0 "Defenders Of The Weak"
 FRN_defenders_of_the_weak_desc:0 "In [Root.GetFrancistriaName], it was always the duty of the knights to defend the weak. Yet now we must ask ourselves if we want to make the weak able to defend themselves instead. Over time, our Order is becoming more and more involved with the governance and administration of our nation instead of honing their skills in battle. Do we return to our roots or accept our new roles?"
 FRN_eleos:0 "Eleos"
 FRN_eleos_desc:0 "Eleos describes the religious tradition of sharing your wealth with those less fortunate. While not universal, the Imperial Eleos was the best example of state-funded Eleos. However, we Trinitarianists would rather foster this behaviour among the populace and encourage our citizens to help each other. If the priests begin sharing their wealth, then hopefully the citizens will follow their example."
 FRN_cultural_revival:0 "Cultural Revival"
 FRN_cultural_revival_desc:0 "The County long supported upper class culture, but often neglected the culture of the lower classes. The cultural activities of the commoners are more important and could benefit greatly from our assistance. Not only that, but we should encourage the formation of a national identity - however, it is a matter of debate what form that identity should take."
 FRN_liberation_ethos:0 "Liberation Ethos"
 FRN_liberation_ethos_desc:0 "We cannot simply sit idly in our own country as the citizens of our neighbouring nations suffer under the iron-clawed rule of oppressive regimes. To do nothing and allow evil to occur is sinful. We must be brave and fight for the sake of liberty beyond our own borders! Only then can our souls know peace."
 FRN_introduce_civilian_service:0 "Introduce Civilian Service"
 FRN_introduce_civilian_service_desc:0 "While conscription is a necessary evil in times of war, there are some who do not wish to serve due to moral concerns. We should respect this and allow conscientious objectors to instead complete their service without having to join the military. Those who opt for civilian service will be trained for war-time rescue operation, civil defence and various support duties."
 FRN_military_self_reliance:0 "Military Self-Reliance"
 FRN_military_self_reliance_desc:0 "We should not be dependant on the arms supplies of others. It is vital that [Root.GetFrancistriaName] is capable of supplying its army with everything it needs, even in a scenario where we are surrounded by enemies. Therefore we must strengthen our arms industry and modernize production methods, so our soldiers will always have everything they need to fulfill their sacred duty."
 FRN_guilds_and_cooperatives:0 "Guilds And Cooperatives"
 FRN_guilds_and_cooperatives_desc:0 "Organized labour is an important facet of distributism, yet trade unions are proponents of violent class struggle. To promote cooperation in society, we will establish guilds and mixed class syndicates, incentivizing collaboration between employees and employers. Instead of capitalist companies, we will also have cooperatives where the workers are empowered."
 FRN_expand_order_archives:0 "Expand Order Archives"
 FRN_expand_order_archives_desc:0 "Over the years, our Order of the Trinity has accumulated a vast collection of tomes on all kinds of subjects in its libraries, yet much of the material is outdated. With increased resources, we can afford to reorganize our archives and acquire the latest books published by groundbreaking inventors and the like. With greater knowledge, we can better understand the divine plans of the gods."
 FRN_unity_of_faith_and_state:0 "Unity Of Faith And State"
 FRN_unity_of_faith_and_state_desc:0 "The relationship between religion and the government has always been murky in [Root.GetFrancistriaName], with the Martlewings having close ties with religious organizations such as our Order while acting like secular rulers. This relationship should be clarified, yet there is debate whether the state should be inherently religious or a separate, secular organization."
 FRN_parliamentary_elections:0 "Hold Parliamentary Elections"
 FRN_parliamentary_elections_desc:0 "The Order deems the transition period to be over and is now ready to hold democratic elections for the [Root.GetAdjective] parliament. These will be the first ones held since the drafting of the new constitution and the establishment of the Guardian Council. That council will remain in place, guiding the nation, but the parliament will gather to propose their own legislation as well."
 FRN_hospital_trains:0 "Hospital Trains"
 FRN_hospital_trains_desc:0 "The horrors of modern war can never be understated. New weapons can cause grievous injuries on soldiers which require immediate medical attention. However, too often military medics lack what they need to save lives on the battlefield. To assist them, we will prepare dedicated and fully equipped hospital trains capable of moving quickly along railroads wherever needed."
 FRN_blessed_armour:0 "Blessed Armour"

 FRN_anti_radical_sermons_desc:0 "Religion is the foundation of societal order, yet the Italian radicals do not care for it. They seek to take away all that we hold dear and build a new, godless world order in their own image. This idolatry is clearly heinous and will bring misery to the griffons of the south. We need to warn our citizens of this threat, so they will be eager to take up arms to fight this evil!"

 FRN_conscript_locals_desc:0 "FLNT is more than happy to attack [Root.GetAdjective] soldiers, but if we conscript local Tarrinians and give them the task of guarding the populace from terror attacks, then their motivation should reduce sharply. We should, of course, try to find volunteers first, but if that proves to be insufficient we can simply force Tarrinians into military duty. It won't be popular, but it will dissuade the rebels."

 FRN_fortify_aquileian_border_desc:0 "There is no doubt that FLNT is getting support from the Aquileian republican movement.

This will also make it easier to defend against Aquileia should they decide to "liberate" Tarrin."

This will also ease the integration of the region into our governance."
 FRN_grant_land_to_colonists:0 "Grant More Land To Colonists"
 FRN_grant_land_to_colonists_desc:0 "The quickest and easiest way to integrate a territory is to populate it with loyal colonists who will represent our interests in the region.

Some concessions will have to be made, unfortunately, and LPF will not be happy with this. But something must be done, or Tarrin will continue to be a volatile warzone."
 FRN_pardon_prisoners:0 "Pardon Prisoners"
 FRN_pardon_prisoners_desc:0 "Over the years, our garrison has captured and imprisoned thousands of Tarrinians, most of them suspected of collaborating with FLNT or being part of it.

By releasing most of our prisoners we will earn the gratitude of Tarrinians, though it might cause resistance activity to grow."
 FRN_invest_in_tarrin:0 "Invest In Tarrin"
 FRN_invest_in_tarrin_desc:0 "Tarrin's economy has suffered greatly from the instability of recent decades, with many companies being too afraid to expand their operations in such a dangerous area. But if we'd be bold and invest into Tarrin, it would encourage businesses to do so as well which would improve the livelihood of the Tarrinians themselves. They will surely be grateful to us."
 FRN_nap_with_aquileia:0 "Negotiate With Aquileia"
 FRN_nap_with_aquileia_desc:0 "Aquileia has not forgotten that the County of Tarrin was once a subject of their nation. They now wish to reclaim the territory and seize it from our rule, with violent force if need be. If we wish to maintain control of Tarrin and avoid bloodshed, we must enter negotiations with the Aquileians. LPF will condemn the attempt, but if we succeed, we will have peace for our time."
 FRN_win_their_hearts:0 "Win Their Hearts And Minds"
 FRN_win_their_hearts_desc:0 "Trying to use force to crush the rebellion will only strengthen it further, as it will turn more Tarrinians against us and make them see us as tyrants. An alternate approach is to gain the trust and support of the local populace, so they no longer are motivated to provide support for the rebel movement. This way we can weaken the resistance without firing a single shot."
 FRN_officialize_tarrinian:0 "Officialize The Tarrinian Language"
 FRN_officialize_tarrinian_desc:0 "While the Tarrinian language shares some similarities with [Root.GetAdjective], it is ultimately closer to Aquileian than any Italian tongue. So far its official use has been forbidden and locals have been pressured to use our language instead, which has caused a significant amount of displeasure. Recognizing Tarrinian as an official language of our government would undo this harm."
 FRN_limited_autonomy:0 "Limited Autonomy"
 FRN_limited_autonomy_desc:0 "Trying to directly govern Tarrin as a part of our realm has proven to be a difficult task, which is unpopular among Tarrinians. Instead, we should consider giving them limited autonomy, with the right to form their own democratic government. Tarrin would exist as an autonomous region within [Root.GetNameDef], obeying its own laws and without obligation to obey the central government."
 FRN_return_land_to_locals:0 "Return Land To Locals"
 FRN_return_land_to_locals_desc:0 "Over the years, large tracts of land have been acquired either by our government or by [Root.GetAdjective] settlers. In addition some has been forcefully seized from suspected terrorists and other criminals. This has turned many aggravated griffons in the countryside into FLNT supporters. By returning land to its rightful owners, we will earn the farmers' gratitude and loyalty."
 FRN_referendum_for_independence:0 "Referendum For Independence"
 FRN_referendum_for_independence_desc:0 "Hoping to appease the unruly Tarrinians, we made vague promises in the past to hold a referendum for independence. Now it is time we keep our promise. However, with everything we've done for the Tarrinians, it is hoped that a majority will vote to stay as part of our nation and embrace the possibility of integration and unification."

 FRN_charity_for_needy_desc:0 "While griffons are generally not known for their generosity, it means being generous is regarded as exceptional and praiseworthy.

 FRN_build_airport:0 "Build The [515.GetName] Airport"
 FRN_build_airport_desc:0 "As air travel becomes more commonplace and the importance of aerial warfare grows, we need a proper base for civilian and military planes. For this reason, we will construct a new and large airport near [515.GetName], which will also serve as a vital refueling point for planes travelling between Aquileia and Italy."
 FRN_army_motorization:0 "Army Motorization"
 FRN_army_motorization_desc:0 "The Italian army began to motorize many years ago and now has entire battalions of mobile infantry that utilize modern vehicles for rapid deployment, moving even faster than flying griffons. We should follow their example and begin the motorization of our own army. For this, we need a sizeable supply of trucks and other vehicles."
 FRN_equipment_modernization:0 "Equipment Modernization"
 FRN_equipment_modernization_desc:0 "Much of our equipment is outdated, with some of the soldiers even having the same rifles that were used during the Falcor War.

Italian arms companies will aid us in our effort."

 FRN_knightly_traditions_desc:0 "Even before the conquests of Francis I, the land that would later become Francistria was famed for its pious and righteous knights. This tradition survives to this day and our knights are proud of their skills. However, these traditions are of little use in the modern battlefield unless some changes are made and our knights are retrained."
 FRN_creeping_barrage:0 "Modern Creeping Barrage"
 FRN_creeping_barrage_desc:0 "The creeping barrage was first used in the final years of the Falcor war, with concentrated artillery bombardments preceding the advance of the infantry, who could break through battered defences with relative ease. While nowadays barrages see less use, they still have potential. Adopting our old tactics for the modern age will allow us to apply them."
 FRN_found_airforce:0 "Found the [Root.GetAdjective] Airforce"
 FRN_found_airforce_desc:0 "Our neighbours in Italy have had an airforce for years now, but we should establish one of our own. We should guard our own skies as well as aid our allies. In the age of modern warfare, control of the airspace is increasingly vital and we should not rely on others to defend us from aerial attacks."
 FRN_crackdown_on_mafia:0 "Crackdown On Italian Mafia"
 FRN_crackdown_on_mafia_desc:0 "Following the economic crisis in Italy, their mafias greatly expanded their operations, even across the borders of the nation.

It is time we intervene and order our police to execute a nation-wide crackdown on these criminal gangs!"
 FRN_free_education:0 "Free Education"
 FRN_free_education_desc:0 "It is the duty of the modern nation to maintain public schools and ensure every citizen attains basic literacy. Unless we want to lag behind in the past, we need to make basic education available for every griffon, regardless of age or background. It will be costly, but it will pay itself back over the coming years."
 FRN_engineering_school:0 "Open The School of Engineering"
 FRN_engineering_school_desc:0 "Engineering is the foundational skill of modern, industrialised societies. However, our country is lacking in skilled engineers, even after the recent influx of Italian intelligentsia.

 FRN_science_patronage:0 "Science Patronage"
 FRN_science_patronage_desc:0 "Promising innovators shall have the support of the government, so they can focus on their studies instead of being distracted by salaried work.

In return, they will share their breakthroughs with us."
 FRN_electromechanical_award:0 "Electromechanical Engineering Award"
 FRN_electromechanical_award_desc:0 "[Root.GetLeader] has made a public announcement that they will offer a generous award to any griffon that manages to make a scientific breakthrough in the field of electromechanical engineering.

 FRN_francistrian_academy:0 "The [Root.GetAdjective] Academy of Sciences"
 FRN_francistrian_academy_desc:0 "It is time we merge various scholarly societies into a single fraternity, centralized in a single location: The academy of sciences.

 FRN_mechanise_mines:0 "Mechanize Goldenfeather Mines"
 FRN_mechanise_mines_desc:0 "The mines in the hills of Goldenfeather are a vital source of iron ore and chromite, but their equipment is badly outdated. We should invest in mechanizing the mining operations by purchasing drills, pumps, elevators and more from neighbouring countries. This will allow the mining companies to greatly increase production."
 FRN_francistrian_wine:0 "Promote [Root.GetAdjective] Wine"
 FRN_francistrian_wine_desc:0 "Long has everyone considered Vinovian wine to be superior to ours, to the point where the unique flavour of our own beverage is not well known. To support our farmers, we will start a government-funded campaign to advertise our wine abroad, reminding griffons that they do not have to drink stale Vinovian wine when they could instead try out something new."
 FRN_railroad_expansion:0 "Railroad Expansion"
 FRN_railroad_expansion_desc:0 "Currently, railways only connect major towns in [Root.GetNameDef], with many settlements remaining stranded from the capital, their traders forced to use rivers or dirt roads for travel. We must invest into our railway network to connect many more towns, to renovate old tracks and to purchase new and faster trains."
 FRN_tractor_factories:0 "A New Tractor Factory"
 FRN_tractor_factories_desc:0 "While our agricultural production is considerable, much of the work still done by claw. We could ease the workload on our peasants and greatly increase production by manufacturing affordable tractors. Therefore we should open a large, state-owned factory dedicated to just that."
 FRN_industrial_development_policy:0 "An Industrial Investment Policy"
 FRN_industrial_development_policy_desc:0 "We have been planning a major push for industrialising our nation, opening many new factories and encouraging further urbanisation.

 FRN_mechanized_agriculture:0 "Mechanized Agriculture"
 FRN_mechanized_agriculture_desc:0 "With our tractor factory producing an ample supply of modern equipment for our farms, it's time to put them to good use.

 ### Ideas
 FRN_noble_council:0 "The Regnant Arengo"
 FRN_noble_council_desc:0 "After Count Francis I founded the realm of Francistria, he allowed local rulers to maintain their titles as long as they became his vassals. Count Francis II, fearing to be overthrown, further pleased the nobles by forming an advisory council, the Arengo, where the three highest-ranking nobles could influence decision-making and represent the aristocracy. Most of the power remained in the claws of the Count.\n\nAfter Tarrin was liberated from the Aquileians, another seat was added to the council. Francis VIII granted the title of Governor-General to his trusted second-in-command Vittorio, making him the "representative" of Tarrin.\n\nThe influence of the Arengo remained limited over the years, until Count Francis VIII's death. Afterwards the council took the opportunity and practically seized power, treating Count Francis IX as little more than a fifth member of the Arengo. However, the nobles often end up in deadlocks with two on each side and thus need the Count to function as a tie-breaker. That is what little authority he has, unless he manages to sway some of the nobles to his side."

While the proud Counts of the past zealously preserved [FRN.GetAdjective] sovereignty, they also sought to maintain close relations with Italy. As [FRN.GetNameDef] primarily focused on exporting minerals and food to Italy, its own economy remained underdeveloped even as Italy itself industrialised. The Counts always had Italian advisors by their side and listened to them closely.\n\nWith the unfortunate death of Count Francis VIII and the weak rule of Francis IX, this has only become worse. Italian companies exploit the [FRN.GetAdjective] economy and the army relies on Wingbardians to train officers and provide supplies. If nothing is done, the nation's sovereignty will erode, until it ceases to exist."

 FRN_beakolini:0 "Benito Mussolini"
 FRN_beakolini_desc:0 "Benito Mussolini was born to a middle class family in 954, and from early age, he had a deep interest in politics. His family's republican leanings made them ardent supporters of the Republican Revolution in Griffonia, and their eventual defeat did not weaken, but rather intensify, young Giulio's support for the cause, especially the more radical left branches of the movement. During his younger years, he worked as a journalist and became a famous firebrand within the left wing of Italian politics.\n\nThe Falcorian war, however, turned into a watershed moment for the young Beakolini, and unlike most of his peer, he was in full support of the war. Through it, he saw the workers being empowered through the fighting and a chance to bring together a divided land. This led to him being ostracized as a warmongerer, and he ended up fired, being told he could go fight the war himself if he viewed it as something good. Beakolini chose to take the insult literally and joined the Italian army, where his zeal and determination let him become part of the elite Italian Bersaglieri.\nWhen peace came, he was a changed griff, and whereas many had been broken on the battlefield, he had found his purpose. He returned to writing, only this time for his own ideology, and ever since then, he has tirelessly written for and organized his own political movement; the 'Blackwings'. He has realized that republicanism is weak and corrupt, socialism a false idol that will break apart the nation. The new path forward organizes the entire nation as one entity, where all griffs are soldiers for Italy's glory. He has named this movement Fascism, and under it, he will see Italy rise to become the master of Griffonia, or die trying."

He fully expected to succeed Francis VIII after his untimely death, but had no strong claim to the throne and the Arengo would rather have a weak Count that could function as their puppet. Now that Count Francis IX has abdicated, he asserted his claim to the throne and with the support of the loyal Knights of the Trinity, became the new Count of the country."

She is the head of several Eatelan companies which are at the forefront of Francistrian industrialisation, but is forced to compete with Italian ones who have an advantage in the market.

The Viscounty of Goldenfeather is the breadbasket of the country and even exports food to Italy, especially as the Prywhen Civil War prevents grain imports and eliminates competition.

 ### Country Leader & General descriptions
 FRN_coward_count_desc:0 "Giosé Debolino Martlewing, whose regnal name is Francis IX and who is commonly known as "Francis The Stammerer", is the most unusual Count of Francistria in its history. He was the third child of Francis VIII's younger brother and the only legitimate heir when the previous Count perished unexpectedly in the Falcor War. No one ever expected him to hold any important position, so his parents had given him little attention. In fact, the only attention he ever received from others was abuse and mockery because of his stuttering, which made him withdrawn and shy.\n\nUnlike his predecessors, Francis is not a proud and loud warrior. He is quiet and prefers to spend time in his private chambers or in the woods near Martlewing Castle, undisturbed by servants and officials. As such, the nobility, fascists and the Tarrin resistance all see their chance to gain power at the expense of the weak and pathetic Count, who will never amount to anything."

As such, the nobility, fascists and the Tarrin resistance all saw their chance to gain power at the expense of the Count. However, their plots failed and Francis has asserted his dominance with his newfound confidence. Perhaps he can make his ancestors proud after all?"
 FRN_angry_bird_desc:0 "Gherita Zarfatti is a veteran of the Falcor War, leader of the fascist LPF, rumoured mistress of Beakolini and, last but not least, a journalist and an art critic with a refined taste. She is the rising star of Francistrian politics, closely cooperating with Beakolini at all times. Her ultimate dream is Risorgimento, unification of all Italian-speaking lands under one nation. She considers Tarrinian to be a Italian dialect like Francistrian, despite most linguists claiming that Tarrinian is a dialect of Aquileian. As an expert propagandist, she is convincing more and more Francistrians to share her beliefs."
 FRN_bird_brienne_desc:0 "Some may call her a heretic, while others call her a defender of the poor and weak. Gina de Gioia is the Grandmaster of the Knights of the Trinity, whose primary duty is to protect members of their often persecuted religious sect, Trinitarianism. Her faith regards all three griffon deities as manifestations of a singular divine form, which is why practitioners of Trinitarianism do not have separate temples or priests for each deity. While the sect has members across the continent, a vast majority of them are in Francistria. Throughout the years, the knights served the Counts loyally and fought alongside them in battle, which was often the only thing keeping them safe from the Archonates that regard them as vile heretics. The Count protects them and in turn they protect the nation. Gina de Gioia herself is pious and kind-hearted, yet a fearsome combatant in battle. She is known for her height, which has earned her the nickname "Gina the Tall"."
 FRN_peasant_from_monty_python:0 "A fat griffon in his fifties, Mario Vicino looks like an average aging peasant. But he is first and foremost a politician, a veteran of the agrarian socialist PSA. His values are a strange mix of conservatism and communism, advocating both the end of nobility and the preservation of traditional Piumontese culture. He used his relatively friendly relations with the Count to betray and kill him, seizing power with the aid of his peasant militia. He distrusts the di Almieri Dynasty and wishes the Italian communists there prevail despite their persecution."
 FRN_cutebird_desc:0 "Arturo Azzurino, commonly known as "The Bloodhound of Soarleto", is a young but capable general who rapidly rose through the ranks after the Falcor War. In that conflict he was little more than a sergeant, but became known for his bold (if harsh) leadership and atrocities committed against the Falcorians. His brutality impressed Vittorio Felice so much that he personally promoted and awarded him for his service. However, in the years since Arturo has grown distant from Vittorio due to his support of the fascists. He is fiercely loyal to the Count and would never think of betraying him, no matter what he does."

 ### Events
 francistria.1.t:0 "The Arengo Convenes"
 francistria.1.d:0 "It remains unclear how Francistria itself will be affected by Italy's crisis. Some fear that Italy will radicalize, while others think a new golden age will await as long as Francistrians trust in their Italian friends. There are many different opinions and debates among the country's nobility, so to come to an agreement the most influential nobles agreed to meet at Francistria City. The young Count was invited as well, though he was not expected to influence the decision making much.\n\nThe Martlewing Castle, standing upon a hill next to the city of Francistria proper, soon received some prestigious visitors: Lady Bianca of Eatela, whose ladyship was small but prosperous, Baron Dante of Roameo, known for his parties and charms but also for the poverty of his forested lands, Viscountess Ippolita of Goldenfeather, ruler of the breadbasket of the country, and last but not least, Governor-General Vittorio Felice of Tarrin, responsible for administering the newly gained realm. Francis came to meet them, though was too shy to say a word.\n\nAfter a formal dinner, the five gathered in a chamber to discuss what Francistria should do with Italy. The Governor-General and the Viscountess both advocated maintaining close relations to the southern ally, while the Lady of Eatela said Francistria had relied on Italy too long and should seek to reduce excessive Italian influence. The Baron had fallen asleep, but when he woke up, said "What have those accursed Wingbardians ever done for us? Where was the King when Falcor burned down Roameo? They call us allies but treat us like a chained hound."\n\nThe nobles' council erupted into shouting and arguing, with the Governor-General and Viscountess accusing the others of endangering their vital relations, while the opponents said the two personally benefited from Italy and disregarded its negative influence on Francistria. Count Francis remained quiet and even considered hiding under the table, until the Arengo went silent and turned to look at him. They were at a deadlock, with two on each side. Francis could cast the deciding vote and resolve the situation. And so, he awkwardly stuttered:"

 francistria.2.t:0 "Fascist March In Francistria City"
 francistria.2.d:0 "In support of Beakolini's march on Rome, the paramilitary fascist organization LPF prepared its own, smaller-scale march in the center of Francistria City. Unlike Beakolini's PNF however, they did not plan to seize power in the nation. The march was organized to show solidarity to brothers and sisters in Italy and to display the ever-increasing power and influence of LPF.\n\nUnlike in Rome, there was no opposition to their march when it began, or at any point during it. At most, only several citizens threw some insults at the fascists, but most dared not anger them. The blackwings marched in orderly columns like a military battalion, lead by the infamous army officer Gherita Zarfatti. She had long been the leader of LPF and was rumoured to be Beakolini's mistress. Following her, the columns reached Martlewing Castle and began to sing Giovinezza, a song favoured by Beakolini's fascists. Francis stayed inside and did not dare to go outside before they eventually left.\n\nIt seems there is nothing in the way of the fascists, so they can freely continue to pompously posture and attract new members."

 francistria.3.t:0 "The Count's Burden"
 francistria.3.d:0 "The Count sat in his office, shuffling documents. Before, the Martlewings had always been absolute monarchs, but Francis IX usually delegated tasks to nobles. This time was an exception. Reforms regarding Francistria's relationship with Italy felt too important. di Almieris had always been friends of Martlewings, so it would simply add insult to injury if a Martlewing didn't oversee the changes himself. However, he had little knowledge of policy-making and diplomacy. He even barely knew how to read and write, having taught himself to do both as a child.\n\nThere was a knock on the door and Francis snapped out of his thoughts. The Lady and Baron had wanted to meet him and discuss about Italy. Hesitantly, he got up and opened the door. The two nobles greeted him, happy that he had supported them in the council, but Francis remained stoic and silent. They all sat down.\n\n"S-so, um, what d-did you have in m-mind?" Francis asked with his stutter.\nThe Baron shrugged. "Nothing, personally. I honestly do not care for the entire matter. I was merely returning a favour to Lady Bianca in the council," he said and winked at her with a coy smile.\nShe rolled her eyes and presented a thick stack of papers. "I have an entire program for curtailing Italian influence. You can trust me with this task."\n\n"A-actually," Francis said quietly, "I don't think I can let others handle this. I-it's too im-important. I have to-to do something m-myself for once."\n\nThe Baron lifted an eyebrow. The Lady sighed and clasped the Count's claw. "Poor Francis. Listen, don't pressure yourself into doing anything. I know how difficult this is for you. You were never supposed to be burdened so greatly."\n"Sor-ry, but I have t-to. I hope t-t-this doesn't offend you."\nShe shook her head. "No no, it's fine. But at the very least take advice from us. And do find someone capable to help you. You can't do this yourself, Francis dear."\nHe nodded slowly and even made brief eye contact with her."

"This meet-ting is supposed to be sec-cret."\n"My apologies, mister Francis. I am simply amazed by the luxury your family has. I lived my entire life in a mud hovel, eating grandma's pasta every day! Meanwhile I am sure you enjoy a different species of fish every meal."\n"N-no, I don't e-eat much. A-anyways, I have some q-questions for you, first of-of all."\n"Go ahead, then. I am very curious to know why a Count wishes to talk to a lowly peasant like me."\n"You and your p-party oppose W-Italian influence, right?"\n"Yes," he said and nodded.\n"You also have the b-best interest of the p-people in mind?"\n"Yes of course," he said and nodded again.\n"And you want to d-do something about those b-blackwing... blackwing thugs?"\n"Yes, yes!" he said and nodded quickly. "Why are you asking all this?"\n"Y-you are perfect then. I-I am asking for y-your help."\nHis eyebrows rose. "My help? Of me and PSA? Oh, such a privilege! Francis VIII would've loved to behead us all personally. You are not at all like him!" He grabbed Francis' claw and shook it enthusiastically. "Mister Francis, from now on you are considered our comrade!"\nFrancis smiled ever so slightly. Behind him in the shadows, an eavesdropping guard turned to leave. She had heard enough. Zarfatti would be furious when she revealed this meeting to her."

Soon rumours began to form of the cause of the strange act. Fascists of LPF were, unsurprisingly, outraged and claimed the leader of PSA Mario Vicino had somehow extorted or threatened the Count for political favours. Once Lady Bianca of Eatela heard of this, she immediately took a train to Francistria City to meet with the Count.\n\n"If I may ask, what were you thinking?" Bianca asked. Francis was sitting behind his desk, absentmindedly shuffling papers so he had an excuse to avoid eye contact.\n"Y-you told me I should g-get help. And s-so I did."\n"But why some dirty communist peasants? I'm not angry, I just want to understand. It's... strange."\nFrancis let out a deep sigh. "They are l-like me, the p-peasants. Always op-pressed and bullied and t-told they can do n-nothing. But unlike m-me, these socialists st-truggle to make the world a b-better and more eq-qual place, free of oppression and f-fear. It's b-better to ask, why wouldn't I ask t-their help?"\n\nBianca nodded, now realizing his motivation. "I... see. If you put it that way, I can understand why you did it. But it was still a rather silly thing to do, as the fascists and nobles are upset."\n"To Tartarus with them," Francis muttered, without stuttering. "Bunch of bullies. I don't care for them."\nBianca raised an eyebrow. "Not even me? I'm a noble, after all."\nWith a faint smile, Francis glanced at her eyes. "With you, I sup-pose I c-can make an excep-ption.""

He stated that the reason for doing so was the excessive influence the foreign companies had over their economy, which drained funds away from their country. It is rumoured that the local socialists of the PSA encouraged the Count to do this act. Knowing his meek character, he only did this because he was coerced to do so.\n\nSeveral of our companies have now lost a substantial amount of wealth and property, including our mining companies which can no longer operate on Francistrian soil. However, the Count has personally compensated them for their losses out of his own pocket. Whether we like it or not, Francistrians are now much less dependent on the Italian economy than they used to be."

In the message, Corina Trasviraire, the leader of the socialist faction in the resistance movement, commended Francis for choosing to cooperate with their comrades in the PSA and for boldly refusing to back down even after protests from the fascists of LPF. She wished he would listen to the advice of Mario Vicino in regards to the rights of peasants and workers.

Especially the activities of Italian oil companies in Transista have been questionable at best.\n\nHowever, the Tarrinians now worry what the County will do with everything it has seized and how the now state-owned companies will treat Tarrinian workers.

In the ensuing firefight many more soldiers lost their lives or suffered wounds before reinforcements arrived and drove back the separatists. In the end, our casualties consisted of nine soldiers, dead or wounded, while the militants lost four. In addition five civilians were caught in the crossfire.

He stopped near a large marble statue of his predecessor, Francis VIII, and examined it closely.\n\nIt depicted him as a larger than life figure, a stern, scarred veteran who did not fear death or Maar himself. He had a uniform adorned with countless medals and a ceremonial sword in his claws. This griffon had boldly seized Tarrin from Aquileia and fought on the frontlines during the fateful Falcor War.\n\nCount Francis IX felt very tiny compared to the imposing statue. He in fact felt pathetic. How could he ever hope to even come close to such a mighty griffon? And why should he even try? He had never been prepared for this. Being a ruler is such a headache. It is a position that should only be held by the strong and determined.\n\nHe snapped out of his thoughts as he noticed another griffon entering the hallway. It was Lady Bianca of Eatela.\n"Oh, there you are, Count. I was wondering what was taking you so long. Baron Dante is getting very impatient."\nFrancis looked at the floor. "S-sorry ma'am, I just g-got distrac-cted. I w-will be there s-shortly."\nBianca glanced at the statue. "Ah yes, Francis VIII. I remember him well. This statue might depict him as a mighty warrior, but in reality he was an angry, bitter griffon. His relationship with his wife, Ippolita, was very rocky. That's why he never had children, and that's why you inherited."\nFrancis looked up. "R-really? I d-didn't know that."\nBianca turned back to him and placed a claw on his shoulder. "Giosé, if I may use your birth name, I know this is a burden to bear. But don't make it worse by deluding yourself that you need to be as 'great' as other Martlewing Counts.

As you may know. The influence of your c-companies and advisors simply grew too great, becoming d-detrimental... detrimental to our own development. I strongly believe. That Franc-Franc-Franc— E-excuse me, sir..."\nGaribald's expression softened. "It is fine. I understand. Count Francis, the houses of di Almieri and Martlewing have always been friends. I do not intend for this to change. But I also see that your nation has grown far too reliant on our aid."\nFrancis nodded, happy that he understood him and that he didn't have to explain himself more.\n"However, I must admit I am offended and disappointed about how your government has resolved the matter. If you had acted with more deliberation, discussing the problem with us, then perhaps we could've figured out a solution together. Alas, you dealt with it yourself, damaging our relations and the prestige of Italy."\nFrancis hung his head low in shame. "S-sorry, your ma-majesty. W-we will consult you in the f-future."\nGaribald smiled. "Apology accepted. I must say, you are not at all like the previous Count. Now come, let us enjoy dinner and celebrate our friendship.""

Count Francis himself arrived late as usual.\n\n"Ladies and gentlegriffs," the leading industrialist began, "The purpose of this meeting is to decide which region in Francistria will be our focus in the upcoming industrial development program. We are proposing two options: Either further develop the capital, making it rival the great Italian cities, or invest into every region equally. Both have their advantages and disadvantages, and it is up to you, esteemed griffons, to decide."\n\nAs soon as he stopped speaking, a furious debate began. Lady Bianca of Eatela argued in favour of developing the capital and its surrounding, saying it would be more economically viable. Viscountess Ippolita of Goldenfeather countered her, saying she just wanted Eatela to benefit for it was near the capital, and said that Francistria was developed enough. Other regions, including her own domain, needed investments to boost their poorer economies. Governor-General Vittorio reminded that "putting all eggs in one basket" was strategically foolish, while Baron Dante surprisingly didn't care for the development of his own region, saying putting any money into backwater provinces was a waste, as their inhabitants were inherently poor and lazy.\n\nOnce again, the Arengo was at an impasse, and Count Francis had to speak up and voice his own opinion so the argument would come to an end."

While Vittorio wasn't formally a member, he was in command of the army, and thus there was a delicate balance of power between the two griffons. Sometimes, it shifted from one side to another.\n\nThe leadership of the fascist party gathered at their headquarters, but this time a group of civilians were allowed to attend the meeting. These griffons were engineers, industrialists, capitalists and others who had been ordered to advice the party leaders on an important matter.\n\n"Ladies and gentlegriffs," the leading industrialist began, "The purpose of this meeting is to decide which region in Francistria will be our focus in the upcoming industrial development program.

Both have their advantages and disadvantages, and it is up to you, esteemed griffons, to decide."\n\nGherita Zarfatti spoke up first. "Obviously, we must focus all our efforts on the capital, as it is closest to the Italian border. By strengthening its economy, we aid the economy of neighbouring southern provinces of Italy. Not only that, but the more centralized Francistria's economy is, the more easy it is to control by our party."\n\nNext Vittorio stood up, adjusting his monocle before he spoke: "Frankly, it is strategically foolish to put all eggs in one basket, so to say. In addition, Francistria City is already developed enough precisely thanks to its vicinity to Italy, while the rest of the nation lags behind. All of Francistria needs the aid of the central government. To truly make our nation strong, all of it must be developed, not just one specific area."\n\nGherita narrowed her eyes. Once again Vittorio dared to challenge her and many of the party leaders seemed swayed by his arguments. As the leadership began to debate further, she hoped they would be loyal to the party itself, instead of some old fool from the army."

"What help do you require?"\n"They are proposing two different plans. One is to concentrate investments into the capital, while the other is to spread them out across the nation."\n"Sounds simple enough," Sir Fabrizio said and tapped his beak with his claw.\n"Indeed, the answer is clear. We need to focus everything on the capital for maximum efficiency," Sir Vincenzo said. "This will make our economy stronger and thus make us stronger against our rivals."\n"I wouldn't say it's clearly the best option," Sir Fabrizio said. "If we were to spread out the funds, we could improve the welfare of our nation as a whole, instead of simply of those living in the capital region.

He had perfectly memorized the lines yet spoke like a two-year-old chick.\n\nA knock on the door startled him. He had told his court to not bother him, but somegriff had defied that order.

He looked up at the mirror again, took a deep breath, and remembered that he stuttered less when angry. So he thought of the LPF, of their pompous parades, and of Gherita's nonsensical rambles.

She did not seem to care for the outrage among Tarrinians that followed, and simply said "They'll accept the truth eventually."\n\nSeveral days after this, the locals in Tarrin seemed to calm down and there even was a lull in terror attacks. Sara Cinelli went on leave and was going to leave Tarrin by car. Unfortunately, her car and her escorts were ambushed as they drove on the hillside roads. FLNT terrorists detonated a bomb in front of the convoy and attacked before the soldiers could recover. Soon after, they retreated, and Sara Cinelli was found mortally wounded. She died several hours later before a hospital could be reached.\n\nThe incident has now appeared on national news.

Governor-General Vittorio, Viscountess Ippolita and General Gherita all arrived in time for the scheduled meeting, and were ready to depart shortly after its end.\n\n"I suppose we can all agree that the Count has become a puppet of the Lady, the Baron and the PSA," Gherita said.

Part of the program was organizing various state-funded cultural events, the most important of which was the Festival of Masks. It was once a traditional celebration held annually before being banned by Count Francis III for being "a foolish waste of time".\n\nNow the event is being held again after a very long hiatus. The event consisted of everygriff wearing masks to disguise their identity and wandering around the town to meet griffons and attempt to recognize them. No one was excluded from participating, so it often led to nobles and commoners intermingling. This, perhaps, had been one of the reasons Count Francis III had banned the event.\n\nNow, Count Francis IX was one of the participants, wearing a simple wooden mask on his face and ascetic woolen clothing. He walked around Francistria City, casually chatting with strangers. His stutter was barely noticeable and he held his head higher than usual. There were no expectations placed on him, and no one was judging his actions and behaviour.\n\nEventually, Francis met a lady griffon and engaged in a lengthy conversation with her. She was clearly an intelligent, savvy and kind griffoness. Not only that, but her voice sounded familiar as well.\n"Lady Bianca, I presume?" he said, guessing her identity.\nHer eyes widened and she laughed."Well, you'd be correct. How did you recognize me? You're not a commoner after all, are you?"\nFrancis smiled warmly. "No. I am a Count, in fact."\n"Really? It's you? I... I didn't recognize you at all. Where's your stutter gone?"\n"It's not. Fully g-gone. But this mask gives me confidence. It helps me. To speak."\nBianca embraced him, catching him by surprise. "I am so glad for you, Francis.

Companies have also expanded their entreprises, bringing in Francistrian workers.\n\nLocal Tarrinians are not particularly fond of the new arrivals. The garrison is often occupied preventing fights from breaking out between locals and settlers, especially in Tarrin city itself, which has a large Francistrian minority. FLNT itself participates in violence aimed towards the newcomers and encourages it.\n\nRecently tensions have been running high after a protest demanding greater representation of Tarrinians in local governance was dispersed by the garrison. In the night following the incident, FLNT commandos raided countless villages in the countryside, targeting Francistrian settlers. They gunned down entire families as they were sleeping. Tarrinian peasants joined them in the lynchings, killing and looting like savages. By the time the garrison forces arrived to stop the terrorists, the commandos had already dispersed, leaving the peasants to face the Francistrian soldiers on their own. Hundreds were arrested and many more shot as they fought back against them, wielding pitchforks and hunting rifles.\n\nAs the sun rose, many hundreds of civilians lied dead. In response, Governor-General Vittorio Felice has imposed strict curfew in all of Tarrin and has vowed to bring the murderers to justice.

He also said that secession may be a dangerous move if Italy is enraged by it and they cannot find any other allies.

"With you by my side, I am ready for anything."\n\nThe Count stood up and walked outside, slowly but not hesitantly. As he appeared, the griffons below noticed him and began to cheer, hailing their elusive ruler. With so many pairs of eyes focusing on him, Francis felt his old anxieties in the back of his mind, but he focused on everything he had learned over the years. Then, he began to speak.\n\n"I send to all my citizens. Both at home and gathered here. This message. W-with... with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if I were able to cross your threshold. And speak to you. Myself. For too long. Have I stayed hidden in sight. Not acting like a true ruler. And f-figurehead of the nation. But no more! From this day on, I want my subjects to know who is their Count. For ultimately it is I who steer. The ship of state. And guide it through the storms. Yet in the end, I am a mere mortal just like you. With my own flaws. And shortcomings. N-no longer do I feel the need to hide them."\n\n"Francistria has already faced. Serious internal threats. And I assure you that I have done my b-best. To deal with them all. I hope this convinces you to trust me. As your sole and absolute sovereign. Vested with the power of the Trinity and the Gods. I wish for nothing but peace and prosperity. For my s-subjects. This is why I ask you to entrust me with having all this power. I may not be perfect. But I have good intentions. And a dream for a bright future. I will do my best to make this dream. A r-r... reality."\n\nDespite breaking down at the end, the audience did not mind and erupted into enthused jubilation, chanting "Long live the Count!".

This will segregate a substantial portion of the rural population from the FLNT, depriving them of supplies, recruits and information.\n\nThese fortified villages will be guarded by the local garrison, surrounded by barbed wire and sentry towers. They will also be positioned strategically so they could support one another and receive quick reinforcements if needed.\n\nWhile the program is predicted to be effective at curbing the resistance, it does displease the local population, making them more sympathetic to the rebels.

 francistria.38.d:0 "Following the meeting of the Arengo, Count Francis IX was once again taking a stroll in the woods near Martlewing Castle, calming his nerves in quiet solitude. Recent events had strained him, but the song of birds and the fluttering of leaves in the wind never failed to distract his mind from the issues of his life. A life which he had never wanted to live in the first place, forced into being the figurehead of an entire nation, attracting so much unwanted attention. All he wanted was to be left alone, yet he had a duty to fulfill. Sometimes he wondered what it would be like to have a different kind of duty entirely. Perhaps there was some job out there that he'd enjoy doing, that wouldn't require forced smiles, tough decisions and lengthy talks?\n\nHis train of thought was broken as an entourage of griffons suddenly appeared, calling for him. He let out an exasperated sigh and went forth to meet them. The group was led by Viscountess Ippolita and Governor-General Vittorio. The latter spoke up when he saw him. "Ah, there you are, my Count! We have a matter we wish to discuss with you, in private."\nFrancis said nothing, which was taken as a sign of approval. Ippolita motioned the entourage to leave and soon it was just the three of them. "Count, we are thankful for your support in the Arengo," the griffoness said. "However, we need you to continue supporting us in the future. The Baron and the Lady are becoming insufferable, proposing nonsensical reforms."\nVittorio nodded. "They wish to bring ruin to Francistria and conspire against you. But with you on our side, we can oppose their reforms and ensure continued stability and prosperity for Francistria."\n"Can we have your word, Count?" Ippolita demanded to know. "Will you swear to stand by our side in the future?"\n\nFrancis felt a strong urge to leave and be alone again, but he had to answer. He had to continue being a pawn in the nobles' petty political games if he wished to remain alive. And so he had no choice but to hesitantly nod.\nVittorio grinned. "Good.

It had changed little over time, with the only notable difference being its owner, the Count. She had been invited to meet him in person, albeit she was not certain what the purpose was.\n\nShe entered Francis IX's office and bowed respectfully. "N-no need to b-bother with the... f-formalities," the Count said. "L-let's just get this done and o-over with quickly."\n\nGina had heard that the Count had stutter, but hadn't expected it to be this bad. Nevertheless, she nodded in understanding. "What do you require, my lord?"\nFrancis seemed bothered. "D-don't call me that, p-please. A-anyways, the Arengo r-requested me to ask for y-your aid. The e-economic crisis of the last few d-decades has caused w-widespread poverty among the g-griffons. Not j-just that, but Governor-General V-Vittorio wishes you to h-help him in military matters."\n"Your wish is my command my lo-- my dear Count. We are already dedicated to helping the destitute, but if we receive funding from you, we will expand our efforts. Not a single beak will go unfed in [Root.GetNameDef]! And of course, I am more than glad to aid in the defence of our homeland."\n"G-good, good. I-it's settled then. You m-may leave now."\nThe Count still hadn't made eye contact with her and now turned around on his chair. Gina stood still for a moment, then spoke. "My dear Count, I can see you are not pleased with having a meeting. May I inquire, why did you not simply delegate this task to a servant?"\nFrancis was silent, but eventually responded, without turning around. "I am the C-Count. I d-do what I must. It's w-what Francis VIII w-would've done."\n"I knew Francis VIII, and I can see you are nothing like him. You don't have to be, my dear Count. You can be anything you wish to be."\nFrancis sighed deeply. "If only that w-were so. Please, l-leave now."\nGina saluted the Count, then left the room.

During the meeting they would draft a comprehensive plan for the future of [Root.GetNameDef] and how the current issues plaguing the nation could be resolved.\n\nThe meeting lasted many hours, during which many fiery arguments were had. Lady Bianca of Eatela kept demanding the influence of Italian companies to be reduced, while Agostino Paolino claimed those companies invested into the local economy and allowed quick growth. Baron Dante on the other claw said the [FRN.GetAdjective] army was a mere shadow of its former self, but Virgilio Piccio rebuked him and said Italy's superior army would take care of defending [FRN.GetNameDef] while cooperating with the local army. Count Francis was always there supporting the Wingbardians, so eventually Lady Bianca and Baron Dante gave up entirely, allowing the rest to do what they liked with the plan.\n\nFinally, a rough draft of a ten-year program was ready, which the advisors would refine into complete form. Italy was strongly involved in it, but on paper the plan seemed effective. Italian companies would employ more [FRN.GetAdjective]s and pay them higher wages, production methods and factory machines would be revised to match those used in Italy, more Italian officers would be integrated into the ranks of the army, and so on. Italy, Italy, Italy.\n\nCount Francis wasn't sure what to think of it all. The way it was written, the plan seemed to treat [FRN.GetNameDef] as a backwards province of Italy itself, instead of its own separate nation. But Viscountess Ippolita and Governor-General Vittorio seemed very pleased with it, rubbing their claws in glee. Perhaps in return they would agree to leave him be for a good while."

The plan stated that Italian companies would prioritize hiring [FRN.GetAdjective]s and said nothing of Tarrinians. It was made worse by the fact that several Italian companies have been accused of seizing land and property from locals in Tarrin and treating their workers poorly. Especially the activities of Italian oil companies in Transista have been questionable at best. Now it seemed they received an expanded mandate to treat the Tarrinians as they pleased. Not only that, but the plan would increase Italian military presence in the nation as well, making the struggle of FLNT even harder.\n\nFLNT has publicly condemned the plan and has called for Tarrinians to do anything they can to oppose its implementation. Soon after riots broke out in Tarrin and Transista where Italian businesses were looted and oil pipes damaged, requiring the army to be called in to restore order."

Therefore we have sent generals Garlo Geloso and Gabaldo Goddu to [FRN.GetNameDef], along with other lower-ranking officers and representatives of arms companies. All this should hopefully prove to be beneficial to our northern friends.\n\nOf course, it's not like the [FRN.GetAdjective] themselves have nothing to teach us.

However, it seems General Gherita of the LPF has managed to persuade some of the Wingbardians to assist them in the fight against FLNT. The southeners had useful knowledge about suppressing resistance from their experience of annexing the city of Falcor and were happy to apply it in Tarrin as well.\n\nWhile this did result in several successful operations, the Tarrinian resistance is far better organized than the Falcorian one ever was, so they are already adapting to the Italian strategies. It has also fueled their propaganda about [Root.GetAdjective]s being Italian puppets intent on erasing the local Aquileian-influenced culture, which has further incited ethnic tensions in the area. While the Italian help is appreciated, they might have done more harm than good."

One of the larger of such companies, Eatela Elettronica, has announced massive layoffs, claiming to be unable to compete with Italian competitors. As a result thousands of workers have been left jobless and are now aiming their frustrations at the government. More specifically, at the Arengo and the Count. Protests have broken out in Eatela, inspiring some smaller demonstrations in [Root.Capital.GetName] and Volino. While most of the protesters are simply venting, some of them have a more political agenda, demanding the Arengo to be disbanded.\n\nIn an emergency meeting of the Arengo, Viscountess Ippolita blamed Lady Bianca for firing the workers in the first place, intentionally seeking to cause unrest. She denied any such accusations as nonsensical. Governor-General Vittorio then suggested sending in the military to crush the protests swiftly, albeit no one, not even Ippolita or Count Francis, supported his proposal. Baron Dante suggested giving some concessions to the protesters without specifying what kind of concessions, which only seemed like he wanted the Arengo to revert some of its pro-Italy policies.\n\nThe arguing seemed to go nowhere and even Ippolita and Vittorio couldn't agree on what to do. So for once, it was up to Francis to propose something. However he lacked the courage to say anything in particular, simply promising he'd take care of the matter. The Arengo reluctantly agreed to let him come up with an answer, every member believing he'd do something that would be beneficial to them."

 francistria.45.d:0 "After consulting Italian advisors and Grandmaster Gina de Gioia, Count Francis came to the conclusion that a bicameral parliament would be the best solution to the middle-class urbanite unrest. The lower chamber would have democratically elected commoners, thus pleasing the lower classes, while the Arengo would act as the upper chamber, thus keeping the nobility in power.\n\nWhen Francis proposed this to the Arengo, he received the acceptance of Viscountess Ippolita and Lady Bianca, but faced opposition from Governor-General Vittorio and Baron Dante. But two council members was enough support for the proposal to be accepted, so soon the idea was taken from Francis' claws and implemented into practice. Both Ippolita and Bianca thought the Count was on their side by making this proposal, so it all worked out according to Francis' plan.\n\nOne week later, the Arengo had formally transformed and all council members were sworn in as senators of the upper chamber. Ippolita and Vittorio did, however, pressure Francis into tranferring some of the crown's remaining power to the upper chamber. Democratic elections were then held, supervised by the Knights of the Trinity, where the members of the lower chamber were chosen. Various political parties had been formed and existing organizations such as LPF and PSA eagerly joined the parliament as well. Yet real power remained in the claws of the nobility, as they could veto anything the lower chamber proposed. Nevertheless, the first steps towards true democracy had been taken and Francis could breathe at ease as his remaining responsibility was reduced even further. Perhaps from now on, the parliament could be the nobility's puppet instead of him."

Italian prospectors had bought the lands around 60 years ago and found huge veins of valuable ores, which were then excavated by our national mining companies. Now it seems [FRN.GetNameDef] wishes to own the mines themselves, so all of their produce and profits doesn't go directly to us. Of course, in return they're offering a fair sum of idols.\n\nThere are three different possible responses for us to consider. Either we simply accept the deal and allow the strategically important mines to come under [FRN.GetAdjective] ownership, or we can try to haggle for a better price, as surely the mines are more important for us than they think. However, this could end up with [FRN.GetAdjective]s giving up on the deal entirely, which may be a good or a bad thing for us. Lastly, we can simply refuse the offer outright, though this would damage our friendly relations somewhat.\n\nHow do we respond?"

It was symbolic of a similar change taking place all across the County. Not only were statues being removed, but even the country itself was going to be renamed into something that wasn't fabricated: Piumont, which was the geographic name of the region south-east of Tarrin. The home city of the Martlewings which confusingly shared the name of the nation was going to regain its original name, Pulcino. It had lost it over 400 years ago when Francis I arrogantly named his conquests after himself, only to satiate his own ego.\n\nYet all this did not anger Francis IX. In fact, the entire project had been his idea in the first place, and the Arengo had happily put it into practice. He felt like the nation shouldn't belong to him or his successors, but rather to the griffons themselves. Before, they had identified themselves as "Francistrian" which was synonymous with "subjects of Francis". Now, they could proudly call themselves Piumontese, identifying themselves as citizens of a nation-state instead.\n\nFrancis sighed happily. The personality cult had placed such great emphasis on the infallibility and might of the Martlewing Counts, and he had been expected to live up to that impossibly high standard. But now, very few griffons took the personality cult seriously. He had failed to live up to everygriff's expectations and had thus unintentionally shattered the entire cult. What was happening now was merely a formality. The statues had already been toppled in the minds of the commoners long before this. Nobody expected anything from him any longer, and thus they would finally leave him alone."

"N-no, sorry, I meant I need more i-information before I can make a d-decision. So tell me, w-what's all this fuss about your faith?"\n\nThe Grandmaster took a deep breath. "We Trinitarianists have always been persecuted, since the days of the Archonates. Our religion interprets Boreas, Arcturius and Eyr as aspects of a single deity, which we refer to as the Trinity. As such we have no separate clergy or temples for each god, for all members of our faith are servants of all three. The controversy comes from us not accepting the authority of the Archons, having our own autonomy and democratically electing our religious leaders."\n"I-I see. Well I d-don't see anything particularly harmful with t-that. The Archons' rule is limited to the G-Griffonian Empire anyways."\n"My dear Count, your ancestors were always our protectors, and while you are unlike them in many ways, I believe we can still remain allies."\n"My p-powers are limited, but I will d-do what I can to p-protect your rights.

A large red banner was waving on its roof, and armed griffons flocked around the building. Gunshots echoed in the distance.\nFrancis' eyes widened. "Mario? W-what is happening?"\nHe chuckled in response. "A revolution, of course. You've declawed the fascists, our biggest opposition, and provided us with the means to gain support and weaponry.

Because of this, even Governor-General Vittorio stood on the side of the anti-Italian faction, leaving Viscountess Ippolita by herself.\n\nAfter many discussions and meetings in both lower and upper chambers of parliament, possible solutions were narrowed down to two. First option would be to formally transfer responsibility of many economic and military matters to Italy while clearly defining which aspects would remain under [FRN.GetAdjective] control, thus protecting parts of the nation's sovereignty. However, this would basically mean turning [FRN.GetNameDef] into a vassal state of Italy, albeit with extensive autonomy. Vittorio and a majority of the lower chamber supported this proposal. The second option would require more effort, negotiations and political balancing acts, but would gradually deal with the issues of Italian dependence, hopefully keeping [FRN.GetNameDef]'s sovereignty fully intact.

The primary issue was the status of Tarrin within [FRN.GetNameDef], while secondary concerns were land rights, abuse of authority by [FRN.GetAdjective] officials, economic exploitation, cultural conflict and political rights. Ultimately, both sides agreed that Tarrin would eventually receive additional autonomy and their own democratic assembly, Tarrinians would have the same rights and legal protections as [FRN.GetAdjective] citizens, and lastly, both sides would pay monetary compensations for damage done to their opponents.\n\nWhile the agreement did not fully resolve all issues and left both sides somewhat dissatisfied, it was an important step taken towards ensuring lasting peace in Tarrin.

We will not need the aid of our allies for this.\n\nUnfortunately, Tarrin might receive protection from the west. Tarrin was once a subject of the crown of Aquileia, and later an Aquileian-aligned republic. There is also no denying that many members of FLNT are Aquileian republicans. This means that if we were to use military force to end the independence of Tarrin, Aquileia or some other power might intervene, refusing to let the region slip from their grasp once again.\n\nThe course of action is now left for [Root.GetLeader] to decide. There is the possibility that action against Tarrin might escalate into a large-scale war, but inaction will mean giving up Tarrin for good.

Not only that, but the fascists of the LPF are urgently pressuring the Arengo to come to Italy's aid against the communist rebels. Even some of the nobility of the nation support intervention, as di Almieri have always been close friends of the Martlewings, so we are honour-bound to save the King before it is too late.\n\nHowever, there is no denying that the rebels are strong, and if we lose this battle, then we lose everything. Is it a gamble worth taking? The anti-Italian nobles of the Arengo claim it is not, and say Francistria should avoid getting involved.

As such, I feel terrible for what I must now do!"\nFrancis frowned. "W-what do you mean?" he asked as he turned to face Mario, but could clearly see the answer.

The two had barricaded themselves inside their last holdout as LPF had been driven out of everywhere else by brave knights and popular uprisings, and the final fall of the LPF did not come from outside, but from within. Count Francis IX and Gina de Gioia were among the commoners and were celebrated as heroes who had led the anti-fascist resistance. Francis smiled as for the first time in his life, he felt like his subjects genuinely admired him.\n\nSome time later, Francis entered his own office, no longer having to fear the blackwing guards occupying his home. He sighed wistfully as he thought of the future of his country. Gina, who stood behind him, smiled. "While we can mostly thank the Trinity for blessing us with success, I must say that we would not have succeeded without your help, Count."\n"P-perhaps, but you and y-your knights did m-most of the work. I was little more than a s-symbol."\n"Being the leader of a country means you are a symbol of the nation. With your resistance, you symbolized the nation opposing the fascists.

The cooks, the cleaners, the servants, the launderers and so on were seen as unthreatening and unimportant, while more high-ranking courtiers had been put in house arrest or had "disappeared" mysteriously. This would prove to be a fatal mistake.\n\nOne day, a guard entered the Count's bedroom to deliver him breakfast, but found the room to be empty. An alarm was immediately raised and blackwings soon rampaged in the corridors of the castle, conducting interrogations with staff and searching every nook and cranny. However, there was no sign of Count Francis IX anywhere. Soon the guards turned on each other, blaming one another for letting the Count escape.\n\nMeanwhile some distance away from the castle, safely hidden in the nearby woods, the Count crawled out of a bag of trash, coughing and retching from the smell. The cleaner who had brought the bag there chuckled. "We made it. I knew the guards wouldn't dare to look inside the bag when they sensed the smell!"\nFrancis brushed some leftovers off of his shirt. "I-I will need n-new clothes, for s-sure."\n"You'll get some once you meet with the others. Now go, and stay hidden! I must return to the castle or I will be shot.

That'd be less boring."\nVicenzo chuckled and looked at the starry night sky. He frowned as he did so. "That's an awfully big bird up there," he mumbled.\nAzzurra's eyes widened. "That's no bird, that's-"\n\nThe flying griffon unleashed a barrage of bullets from his machine gun and the two guards were shredded to pieces. He landed, and soon an entire group of griffons did the same. They were all clad in enchanted platemail and armed to the beak with guns and explosives.\n\nAn alarmed guard entered the balcony and perished within seconds. Then the knights rushed inside, walking on their paws and holding their guns with their claws. Any guards they met were killed as soon as they showed themselves. Some blackwings managed to pull the trigger before dying, but bullets almost always harmlessly ricocheted off of the knights' gleaming magical armour. Only one knight fell on the way to the Count's bedroom.\n\nThe locked door was broken open with the butt of a heavy rifle, and a knight entered. Count Francis sat on his bed, waiting for them. "Y-you're awfully noisy with your p-promised rescue, you know that?"\n"No time for chatter, we must go before enemy reinforcements arrive," the knight muttered and grabbed the Count, pulling him along as the knights headed back the way they came.

She was proud of what she had achieved, but even prouder of her soldiers who had fought, bled and died to realize the national dream of unification. They were martyrs of the nation and would now forever live on in the hearts of its citizens.\n\nYet Gherita sighed, as she wasn't blind to what lied ahead. The struggle was not over yet. The remnants of former countries would have to be erased, new administration and laws established, governors appointed, and so on. It would be an arduous and difficult task, and far less heroic than the wars had been. She felt like she could not bear the weight of such responsibility alone. Thankfully, she didn't have to.\n\n"This is only the beginning," said Benito Mussolini, who stood next to her. "Now begins the history of a united Italy, and I feel like the nation will face many challenges in the future."\n"Indeed," Gherita said. "But I am not afraid.

 francistria.100.d:0 "Today an art exhibition was officially opened in Francistria City, where a new art movement was launched, known as "Mille Wingbardiano", or the "Italian 1000s". An entire gallery was reserved for works belonging to this movement. Its founders, most notably including the general and art critic Gherita Zarfatti, participated in the opening ceremony, as did Benito Mussolini who had been invited to hold a speech. The movement after all was strongly inspired by Beakolini's fascist ideology. Many of the founding artists were war veterans, including Gherita herself, and most of them were fascists themselves.\n\nThe movement had no strict programme, so the styles of the different works of art varied greatly. What they did have in common was a desire to return to traditional art yet renew it and revolutionize it. The art was also not very realist in style, with Zarfatti saying that the artists "would not imitate the world created by the Gods but would be inspired by it".\n\nHowever, the movement had a rocky start, with Beakolini himself lacking interest in art. At the opening, he said that art belonged to the individual, and organizations and nations should only encourage artists and provide them ideal conditions for creating art. With this, he implied that the movement would not receive the direct support of the Italian fascist party. Not only that, but Mille Wingbardiano was in competition with other popular art movements such as Mago-Futurism, and some fascists denounced it altogether, condemning the "non-Italian" styles of some of the Francistrian artists. Nevertheless, the movement heralded a new age in Francistrian art."

 francistria.101.d:0 "As the fascist council gathered for another meeting, tension was already in the air. Cooperation between two of the leading figures of LPF, Gherita Zarfatti and Vittorio Felice, had reduced greatly after the successful coup. Now the two military griffs butted heads about almost everything that was debated in the council, and both of them had their own supporters who stood behind them. This meeting, it seemed like, would once again become somewhat of a battleground between the two sides.\n\nThe subject matter being discussed was the Trinitarian faith and how its practitioners should be treated by the state. So far the Francistrian Counts had left them alone, despite repeated requests by the Archonates to suppress the subversive "heresy". Now the party had to decide what their official policy would be regarding the religion.\n\n"We Wingbardians have been loyal servants of the Archonates for centuries," Gherita Zarfatti said, calling Francistrians Wingbardians as she usually did. "And even after the collapse of the Empire and the weakening of the Archons, Prelates of the Three Temples are still highly respected. Yet there are some who deny their authority and have their own religious leaders. These Trinitarianists threaten the integrity of our nation, and reject the Italian identity by rejecting the Archonates. Not only that, but taking action against these condemned heretics would improve our relations with the Prelatures and Archonates. Therefore, I say we stop tolerating Trinitarianists and encourage them to convert to the mainstream faith."\n\nVittorio clapped slowly. "A nice speech, albeit I never knew you cared so much for religion. Wasn't fascism anti-clerical at one point?"\nGherita smirked. "Perhaps, but the truth is majority of the citizens are Archonists. Therefore, the state should support the supremacy of the Archonates."\n"This is where you show a grievous misunderstanding of Francistrian culture. Before the formation of the Archonates, everyone here was Trinitarianist, until foreign influence of the Archonates grew and began to supplant the indigenous faith. Trinitarianists are those who clung on to their traditions and identity despite all the pressure. These griffons should be respected, not persecuted."\nGherita clenched her claws, but remained calm. "Well then, fellow fascists!" she asked from the rest of the council. "What do you think of the matter?""

"And this is what you call 'class collaboration'? I thought that was part of fascist policy."\nGherita sneered at him. "Yes, but if you think armchair intellectuals and violent thugs represent the working class, you're badly mistaken."\n"Well, quite a lot of the peasantry seems to like Mario and PSA. If we take violent action against them, the peasants won't like that."\n"Do you think I was not aware of that?" She pulled out some papers from a suitcase and presented them. "I have an entire program prepared to bring the rural workers to our side, offering them protections and fair wages, and promising free land."\n"So why not take that a step further?" Vittorio said and put a paper of his own on the table. "Here I have a peace treaty with the PSA, to put an end to violence. Mario has already signed it, as I told him if he did not the full force of fascism would be brought down upon him."\n\nThe griffons in the room gasped. Vittorio had gone ahead and done something like that without even informing Gherita? After the initial shock resided, pro-Gherita and pro-Vittorio fascists began to squabble and yell at one another, until Gherita barked an order for them to stop. "Well, good work getting him to sign it," she told Vittorio, "But if the rest of the room doesn't sign it, then it's a worthless piece of paper."\nVittorio seemed unshaken and turned to the other griffons in the room.

 francistria.103.d_disband:0 "By official decree, the Order of the Knights of the Trinity was disbanded, and its members were to be arrested on the charge of treason, with the arrest warrant stating that "The Gods are not pleased. We have enemies of the faith in the nation". All the property of the order would be nationalized by the state. Anyone suspected of associating with the knightly order would also be interrogated. The Prelate of Francistria, Pietra, who had so far taken a conciliatory stance with the Trinitarianists, was ordered to denounce the knights and officially support the persecution. She had no choice but to accept.\n\nBlackwings were then sent out into the countryside, arresting any knights they found. In some cases knights resisted arrest, but they were swiftly crushed by an organized military response. Most knights did not resist, knowing it was futile to do so, and were then coerced and tortured into admitting various crimes which could be used against them in court. While many of them retracted their confessions afterwards, it was of no use. Hundreds of knights were executed, including the Grandmaster, Gina de Gioia, who was seen praying moments before being shot by a firing squad.\n\nThe action taken by LPF was swift and brutal, yet most importantly efficient. The knights' resistance was utterly broken and the public was in shock as official propaganda published the confessions of the knights, without telling anything about torture. Most of the citizens now believed the Knights had indeed been traitors who plotted in the shadows, and were relieved that the fascists had dealt with the threat.\n\nFor the Trinitarianists, it meant their greatest defenders were now gone, and they were at mercy of the pro-Archonate government. Thousands began to flee persecution abroad, to countries which were more accepting of religious minorities."
 francistria.103.d_reform:0 "By official decree, the Order of the Knights of the Trinity was to be integrated into the national army, instead of being its own autonomous organization. Its leadership would now be directly subordinate to the military high command and thus the national government. All of the property of the order without military use would be nationalized by the state. Any knights who opposed this integration would be charged with treason and arrested. This motion had been put forward by Vittorio Felice, who thought the knights were powerful soldiers and thus should not be wasted. He claimed that by being part of the army, the knights could better fulfill their duty, but in truth it was simply a way to bring an end to their resistance against LPF.\n\nInitially some knights resisted and refused to swear oaths of loyalty to the army leaders, but after a violent crackdown and mass arrest, the knights were more open to cooperation. Their Grandmaster, Gina de Gioia, appealed to her knights, asking them to stop resisting for their own sake. They could not resist the entire Francistrian army by themselves, so they had no choice but to become part of it, or face destruction.\n\nIn the end, the integration was a success and the Knightly Order was absorbed by the army. Their active resistance had thus ended as well, but passive resistance continued as the knights were more hesitant to fight. Nevertheless, Trinitarianists in the country were happy to see that their defenders could still do their duty, even under fascist rule."

As is Francistrian tradition."\n"For the last time, Italian, not Francistrian." One of Gherita's blackwings gave her a weapon, a falchion with a wide blade and a hilt decorated with gold and gems. "Come then, let's not waste anymore time with talking."\nVittorio's soldier gave him his own weapon, an elegant longsword with a narrow blade. He then assumed a fighting stance, standing on his rear legs. "En garde."\nGherita approached him, wielding her sword with two claws. "In guardia, you unpatriotic traitor.

The militiagriffs did not march in any clear order, so it appeared more like a large mob passing through the city. Red banners were waved, prisoners from the army were dragged in chains and joyous revolutionary songs were chanted. Mario Vicino, the leader of PSA, was at the head of this column, proud of what his griffons had accomplished.\n\nYet as he looked at the bystanders, he saw their lack of enthusiasm. Most of them were simply observing, with only some of the more communism-influenced urban workers cheering or even joining the parade. The urbanites seemed sceptical, perhaps even hateful, of the throng of peasants trudging through the city. Some of them seemed worried, possibly by the rumours that the Count had been killed. The city-dwellers had always liked the Counts and had been content to live under their rule, even if they sometimes had issues with the more rural nobility of the Arengo.\n\nMario scoffed at them. Piumont - or Francistria as the monarchists called it - had no strong urban socialist movements, and Mario believed this was because Piumont had industrialized too late for a proletariat identity to develop among the labourers. Meanwhile the minds of the merchants and other parasites were poisoned by greed and selfishness. The rich urbanites hardly cared for the peasants as long as they kept growing them food. They were all exploiters, seeing themselves as above peasants, many of them having abandoned the countryside in search of wealth. He knew for certain that the opposition to his rule, like the knights and the fascists, would use the bourgeoisie as their power base.\n\nSomething had to be done about this all.

"Sir, my family, or what remains of it, was always considered to be part of minor nobility. And I personally bear no titles."\n"A noble is a noble, and records show you used to own a hefty plot of land south of Volino. Not only that, but I've heard you've treated commoners in the army ranks quite poorly."\n"Sir, while yes, the former is true, I owned little more than the average freeholder. And the latter is a mere fabrication-"\n"That's enough, that's enough, my dear. I've heard all I wanted to hear," Mario said and smiled warmly.\n\nArturo winced slightly as Mario shot the corporal with his pistol. Then, the corpulent griffon moved over to him.

Just don't make me regret this, alright? If you learn to trust me, I feel like we can become the best of friends."\nArturo hesitated for a moment, but realized that befriending him and earning his trust might be the best course of action for what he wanted to do.

One of them was even accused of being a witch, even though griffons didn't have enough magical power to be one. Yet Arturo could do nothing but relay orders to soldiers. Any sign of disobedience or dissidence would make Mario immediately lose his trust in him and he would be sentenced to die.\n\nAs Arturo ordered the peasants to fire at the row of convicts, he felt real regret for what he had done at Soarleto, for the first time in his life. Perhaps if he hadn't massacred all those disgusting Falcorians, this wouldn't have happened to him.

Once, the stores of Francistria City had sold all kinds of products from all around the world, ranging from household appliances to Zebrican exotics. Now, almost everything offered was local produce.

Relieved, he travelled to Mario's home far from any major settlement.\n\nThe two headed out, walking down a dirt road surrounded by fields which had recently been cleared. Mario was a slow walker because of his weight, so Arturo kept slowing himself down. He felt like trying to walk ahead of Mario would just result in a death sentence for himself.\nMario took a deep breath and let it out. "The butcher's work is finally done, and now we can be in peace. Is it not wonderful?"\n"Well, I am happy it is over," Arturo replied.\n"Yes. I know you are. I am happy too. The terrible things were done because they had to be done. However, I would not be so happy without you."\nArturo hid his disgust well. "What do you mean?"\n"Well, you know, it gets lonely here at the top, my friend. I lost contact with my family long ago. My true family nowadays is my party, but they are not my friends. They are political allies, and thus cannot be trusted. If I loosen my grip at all, they would take advantage immediately!" Mario let out a hearty laugh. "But you, you I can trust. You do not care for politics. I know that you hated the fascist infiltration of our military back in the day."\n"That is true."\n"Therefore I trust you." Mario put a claw on his shoulder, which almost made Arturo shudder. "You followed my orders and truly proved your loyalty. You also proved how you understand me, unlike anyone else. Do you know how many times I've been called a tyrant? It's silly. But you never do that."\nArturo forced a smile and nodded. "Yes, you're right. And I am... glad... to call you friend."\nMario laughed again and slapped him on the back. "Don't be so shy! Friendship is a good thing in an otherwise bleak world. The ponies even say it's magic."\n"I can see why."\n\nThe two continued to walk without talking anymore. Arturo was pleased to learn he had earned Mario's trust. Now he just had to wait for an opportunity to strike and kill the tyrant. Unfortunately, he felt like it was too late for Francistria."

 francistria.112.d:0 "Arturo wondered how patient justice actually was. It had been so long since he had gained Mario's trust, yet he still had not avenged the death of his comrades. In his mind, the excuse was that he never had the perfect chance to do a clean kill, as Mario was usually accompanied by a peasant soldier or some loyal lackey. Not to mention that Mario still made sure to disarm him before meeting him, and killing such a heavy griffon without a gun would be difficult.\n\nBut in the back of his mind, Arturo knew why he hadn't done anything. He, too, was lonely.\n\nEvery griffon he could've considered to be a friend was long dead or had fled the country. And as much as he despised Mario, he couldn't help but admit that he was right in many ways. They understood each other. Even now, as Arturo planned the cold-hearted execution of someone who considered him to be a friend, he knew Mario would've done the same, in case he had to punish Arturo for betrayal. Perhaps somewhere out there, there was a Falcorian griffon who hated him as much as he hated Mario.\n\nIt was a mad cycle of revenge and violence. He knew that if he enacted justice upon Mario, Piumont would collapse. Over the years, the entire nation had been rebuilt from the ground up, and Mario was the foundation. Killing him would make the whole rotten structure come crashing down. Perhaps he should stop being so obsessed with justice and revenge. Maybe... he and Mario could be friends. Real ones.\n\nArturo snapped out of his thoughts as the door of Mario's home opened, and the fat griffon came outside. It was time for another daily walk. Maybe Arturo could confess, reveal his thoughts, and promise to be a true friend to Mario. They were both terrible persons, but perhaps forgiveness was the path to redemption.\n\nMario did not disarm him.\n\nArturo felt cold sweat on his feathery brow as he walked alongside Mario, his pistol still in his holster. They were alone, the road and the surrounding farm fields were empty. Now was the perfect chance to kill him. Yet he hesitated. His heart pounded as the fate of Piumont, no, Francistria, hung in the balance."

The characteristic smile of Mario was gone. The tyrant was dead.\n\nArturo did not feel like a hero. He felt like a dirty traitor, an executioner still playing out his role. His smoking pistol fell on the ground from his shaking claws.\n\nThe only person who understood him and provided for him was gone. Now there was truly no one else left. He was alone, perhaps permanently. But he did not want to die, not just yet.\n\nAs peasant soldiers rushed to investigate the gunshot, Arturo spread out his wings and took flight. He flapped his wings as hard as he could, flying away from the site of the murder, flying away from Francistria. He knew his homeland would now be engulfed by anarchy, and he did not want to stay around to witness the consequences of his actions. Despite being a cold-hearted executioner, he felt like he had always been a coward.\n\nThere was only one way he could truly redeem himself, and this wasn't it. His spirit was shattered, his morality broken. He had to make a pilgrimage to Solarspike, the holiest place of griffonkind. Only the gods could save him now, and he prayed they were forgiving, even as he heard the mad cackling of Maar in his mind."

"And if they were necessary, they no longer are, now that the situation in Fran- I mean Piumont has stabilized."\nMario sighed. "Everything I did was for my dear fellow peasants. They don't need me bossing them around. I should let them rule themselves!"\n\n"Exactly. Maybe offer amnesty for some prisoners too? Overhaul the judicial system? There are many good things you could do to make our nation a better place."\n\n"Yes! Deurbanization was merely the beginning. I see what you mean now. It is not an utopia unless every peasant is happy with it."\nArturo knew this wasn't much, but it was a catalyst for further change. Eventually, Francistria would heal and recover from this madness.\n\n"What do you think, Arturo? Can griffons like us ever find redemption?" Mario unexpectedly asked.\nArturo frowned and pondered for a moment. "What we did can never be erased. But we can make up for it in other ways. Maybe it's never enough to truly redeem our souls from Maar, and maybe some griffons will never forgive us. At least it will give us internal peace, if nothing else."\nMario nodded in agreement. "You are a good friend, Arturo. I am glad I spared you, and from now on, I'll make sure more griffons get spared."\n\nArturo smiled genuinely, for the first time in a while."

Only after the Arengo's rise to power did the Castle become a symbol of corruption and aristocratic oppression.\n\nAs the peasants now looted and burned noble manors all across the country, it was only a matter of time before Martlewing Castle met a similar fate. It had already been emptied of countless valuables and treasures, most of which would be sold off abroad or melted down into more useful products. Mario had ordered for the castle to be demolished entirely, so none of it would remain. The peasant militia obeyed by emptying the gunpowder storage in the barracks of the capital and hauling its contents to the top of the hill. Now, everything was ready for the complete erasure of this symbol of stone which stood as a sign of tyranny and exploitation.\n\nMany peasants in the audience below cheered, eagerly awaiting the spectacle, yet the inhabitants of the capital did not share their enthusiasm. Instead, they looked on in silent terror, some on the verge of tears.\n\nThere was a countdown, then a gigantic explosion which shook the hill itself. Griffons covered their ear holes and looked in a mix of awe and horror as the entire stone structure was splintered apart like it was nothing more than a fragile mud hut. Some debris rolled down the hill or flew high up in the air, so griffons soon retreated looking for cover. Some were laughing in joy, but others were openly weeping."

Before her eyes was the work-in-progress constitution of [Root.GetFrancistriaName], which would turn it into a democratic parliamentary republic. However, it was based more on traditional Trinitarianist religious administration than the newer ideals of the Griffonian Republicans.

Remember the old [Root.GetAdjective] proverb: Better to teach a griffon to fish than to feed them for a lifetime.\n"You are saying we should abandon our duty?" Vincenzo asked in mild disdain.\n"No, not fully. We can continue to retain our martial tradition and fight for our country. But we should concentrate our efforts on managing the country, and train the citizenry in the art of war, so they are not overly reliant on us."\nSir Vincenzo turned to his Grandmaster. "Well, what do you think of this, ma'am? I personally disagree with it, as we were never meant to be bookkeepers or judges, but warriors.

And even speak a very similar language, to the point where it is considered a dialect."\n"That is true," Sir Vincenzo said, "but we also have a unique, purely [Root.GetAdjective] spirit inside of us, clearly different from the Italian one. Not to mention how the commoners have many traditions that cannot be found in Italy, and how most of them are more loyal to the [Root.GetAdjective] nation than anything else."\n"Yet they also see Wingbardians as close relatives, and would happily embrace them and live under a larger nation together," Sir Fabrizio said. "Not to mention more pragmatic concerns, such as maintaining good relations with Wingbardians and encouraging cooperation and trade between our folk."\n"I see now why this matter is so complex and controversial," Grandmaster Gina said and chuckled.

As a Trinitarianist, she subscribed to the doctrine of two kingdoms, where secular nations and religious organizations have separate duties, albeit with overlapping spheres of influence. This is why she was so reluctant to place the Order of the Trinity in charge of the nation. But on the other claw, so far their custody of [Root.GetFrancistriaName] had gone well, so why not officialize the position of the Order, the Trinitarian Temple, and the Archonate Temples? This wouldn't undermine democratic civilian government, as they could simply co-exist.

Thus, the knights could focus on fulfilling their duty as warriors and defenders of the country.

Two of the prominent ones, most likely to win the upcoming elections, were the Faith and Tradition party and the Religious Socialist party.\n\nThe former was led by none other than Marco Martlewing, claimant to the now-defunct throne of [Root.GetFrancistriaName]. The Order's rise to power did not dissuade him from pursuing his ambitions and he quickly adapted to the new democratic regime, using his wealth to fund political campaigning. He offers a more conservative and moderate political platform, claiming that religion and tradition both should be the foundational pillars of [Root.GetAdjective] societies, and that his party would make sure the Order's Guardian Council would not stray too far away from traditions. The latter party is led by the Archonist Prelate of [Root.GetFrancistriaName], Pietra. Any restrictions on religious figures participating in politics had been lifted, so she had eagerly joined the political scene. Her party is in some ways more radical than the knights, wishing to create a blend of religious values and socialism. Pietra's skills at appeasement however means that she'd unlikely allow her party to push for any drastic changes.\n\nOnce the election day comes, voter turnout is impressively high, with ballots across the nation being filled with votes.

Francistria, as a small country, was unable to deal with them. Now that [Root.GetNameDef] occupies the area, the responsibility of dealing with them is now on our shoulders.\n\nThe easiest way to end the resistance is to negotiate directly with FLNT leaders. They will most likely demand extensive regional autonomy or even nominal independence. Alternatively, we can expend a considerable amount of time and resources to resolve the issue with a military solution. The latter has less public support, but the former will mean we cannot fully benefit from occupying Tarrin. The last option is the transformation of Tarrin into a puppet state, independent on paper but required to follow our foreign policy.

First, all of Tarrin was divided into sectors, and each sector was assigned a garrison, tasked with suppressing resistance in their area of responsibility. Next, any support from abroad or other regions which FLNT was possibly receiving was addressed by building a barrier on the border of the region, consisting of mines, barbed wire, electrified fences and anti-air turrets with searchlights. This would prevent infiltration on land and in the air. Lastly, the garrison would conduct search and destroy operations, targeting areas with highest resistance activity.\n\nThe civilian populace would not be spared from the campaign. Any villages that harboured resistance members (or cooperating with them in any way) were torched, their inhabitants driven from their homes, robbed and sometimes slain. A strict curfew was imposed to isolate the civilians from the resistance members. Conscripted locals were used in the anti-guerrilla operations as well, utilizing similar tactics which FLNT used, to devastating effect.\n\nDespite their best efforts to fight back, FLNT suffered massive casualties, with thousands of its members being detained and hundreds killed. As the local populace saw how FLNT's strength was faltering, they were even less motivated to aid them, feeling that hope was lost. In the end, the remnants of FLNT began to surrender en masse, its leaders fleeing abroad.\n\nAfter much bloodshed and suffering, the Tarrinian insurgency had finally come to a painful end."

"Y-you're welcome, your m-majesty." Marco followed Giosé as he toured him around the castle, showing all the rooms and introducing him to the castle's staff. Marco was friendly and talkative to all of them, already asking about what issues with the castle's management should be addressed. The last room Giosé showed to him was his personal office. As soon as he saw it, he went to reorganize the pencils and papers on the table into neat rows and piles.\n\n"S-seems like you're e-eager to get started," Giosé said. Marco nodded as he rearranged the furniture. "Of course! This has been the greatest day of my life, yet I have no interest in celebrating. There is much work to be done!"\n"I-I'm sure you'll b-be a much better C-Count than I was."\nMarco frowned. "Hm? What do you mean? You were a good Count."\nNow it was Giosé's turn to frown. "E-excuse me?"\n"You wisely asked the Wingbardians to improve our economy and military, you made the Grandmaster your closest advisor and you led the democratization of the nation thus ensuring future stability. You were an expert delegator and gave the right tasks to the right griffons."\n"Huh. I-I... never thought of it t-that way."\nMarco sat down in his office chair. "Remember, Giosé, be proud of your strengths. Not ashamed of your weaknesses."\nGiosé smiled and bowed his head in gratitude. "T-thank you, C-Count. Long m-may you r-reign.""

 francistria_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]After the collapse of the Griffonian Empire and the Aquileian Revolution, many countries had declared independence, with the last one being the Free Territory of Adelart which broke off from the County of Greifwald in 987 ALB. In the years since, the number of nations on Griffonia had not grown, until now.\n\nThe Republic of Tarrin, the western half of [FRN.GetNameDef], has now declared independence. The region has long been in turmoil, with the resistance movement of FLNT fighting against the [FRN.GetAdjective] garrison. Now they have won, but it remains to be seen how long their newborn nation will last in these tumultuous times."

This prompted the fascist government of Francistria, who have close ties to the infamous Beakolini, to intervene and "restore order" in the south. After taking the capital, Rome, and securing Italy, they have restored the monarchy and cemented their rule. While there is now order, there won't be peace, as the fascists have already announced their plans for "Risorgimento", the unification of all Italian-speaking lands."

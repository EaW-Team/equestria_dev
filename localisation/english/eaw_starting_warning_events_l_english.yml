# These events show up at the beginning of the game for countries that we consider to be lacking in amount of content, quality of content, or would likely lead to a poor experience for a new or uninformed player.
# They don't have any effects.

starting_warning_event.1.t:0 "WARNING - Poor/Barren Content" # DED / HLR / NCH / STL / PNG / BUF / GRW
starting_warning_event.1.d:0 "Greetings. This message is here to let you know that we (the developers of this mod) consider the country you selected to be well below our current standards.\n\nCompared to almost every other nation that we have developed, this one is either lacking in content (the focus tree, decisions, lore, etc.) or its content is inferior in quality. We do plan to rework this country at some point, but there will be some time until that happens.\n\nIf this is your first time playing Equestria at War, we suggest picking a different country, such as one of our more recently updated nations. The "Interesting Countries" screen at the main menu has a lot of very good options to choose from.\n\nIf this is not your first time playing the mod or you wish to play this country anyways, we hope you have fun.\n\n- The Equestria at War team"
starting_warning_event.1.a:0 "Okay."

starting_warning_event.2.t:0 "WARNING - Generic Focus Tree" # All Generic Countries
starting_warning_event.2.d:0 "Greetings. This message is here to let you know that the country you have selected has a generic focus tree and therefore has very little content (No lore, no wars or few wars, no unique mechanics, and so on).\n\nIf this is your first time playing this mod, we recommend going back to the main menu and selecting a different country, such as one of the many options in the "Interesting Countries" screen.\n\nIf you know what you're doing or if you wish to play this country anyways, we hope you have fun.\n\n- The Equestria at War team"
starting_warning_event.2.d_special:0 "Greetings. This message is here to let you know that the country you have selected has a generic focus tree that is locked. You cannot do any focuses.\n\nWe highly recommend you go back to the main menu or shut down Hearts of Iron IV immediately.\n\nIf you know what you're doing or if you wish to play this country anyways, we hope you have lots of fun!\n\n- The Equestria at War team"
starting_warning_event.2.a:0 "Okay."

starting_warning_event.3.t:0 "WARNING - Very Old Country" # STG
starting_warning_event.3.d:0 "Greetings. This message is here to let you know that the country you have selected is one of the oldest countries in the mod, and thus it is not quite up to the standards we've set with many of our newer releases. It is currently being reworked, but there will be some time until that is finished.\n\nStalliongrad in particular has a few issues (notably with certain paths not working properly due to how old this country is, as well as a general lack of flavor/lore) that may lead to a poor experience.\n\nIf this is your first time playing this mod, we recommend picking a different country, such as one of the many other options in the "Interesting Countries" screen back at the main menu.\n\nIf you know what you're doing or if you wish to play this country anyways, we hope you have fun.\n\n- The Equestria at War team"

SAM_iron_regency_desc:0 "Herra Manfred Vanistö, regent of Sambar, took power following the events of 1005, but has refused to coronate a new Yaril ever since. The sheer brutality of Vanistö in his quest to eradicate native rebellion has led him to be known as the "Iron Regent" - a hero among the Olenian settlers that saw their towns ravaged by the Summer Revolution, but scarce beloved by any. The natives, of course, have a different idea, and even much of the nobility has begun to disagree with the methods of Vanistö in his quest to return Sambar to the old way.\n\nOne thing is clear, however - Vanistö must choose a new Yaril for Sambar soon."
SAM_shattered_yarildom:0 "Legacy of '05"
SAM_shattered_yarildom_desc:0 "Native princes, Doelhi insurgents, and Macawian-backed democrats revolted against the Sambari government in a harrowing event known as the "Summer Revolution", where the Yaril was murdered and the government of Sambar itself was briefly replaced by a native council. Pledging to institute a princely federation in the style of Doelhi before a further government could be chosen, the native council received broad support from Sambar's Hindian class, who still grieve its loss. Although with the help of the navy, our glorious leader Manfred Vanistö eventually brought an end to the rebellion, the damage was already done. The direct patrilineal line of the Yarils of Sambar was extinguished, and Vanistö found himself ruling a city of ashes and a country torn apart by the effects of the revolution.\n\nThe natives have not forgotten the crackdowns of Vanistö nor the glories of their first revolution, and are determined to set Sambar right once more - whatever the cost." 
SAM_jewel_of_sambar:0 "The Jewel of the Sambari"
SAM_jewel_of_sambar_desc:0 "Sambar's great navy, affectionally titled "Samambarhee Ka Gahana", or "the Jewel of the Sambari", has never been defeated by rival vikings, Macawian pirates, nor foreign peacekeeping forces. The fact that Sambar has faced so many revolts, harsh summers, and failed industrialization policies makes its navy a symbol of stability and order in a chaotic landscape. However, not all is well within the ranks of the navy - its bloated budget has seen Sambari suffer to conserve their jewel, and the commanders themselves have shown displeasure for the violent, hostile actions of Regent Vanistö and his zealous reliance on the admiralty to do his dirty work.\n\nAs long as Herra Manfred has the navy on his side, there is little chance any petty revolt could stop him - but if the admirals ever had an interest in ending the regency, there would be nothing to stop them."

sambar_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Herra Manfred Vanistö was once treated as nothing more than an afterthought in the greater picture of Hindian politics. If the natives didn't do him in, they said, then it would be the admirality, the supporters of some boy Yaril's claim, the arrogance of the Iron Regent of Sambar himself. Still, through everything, it is the Regency without a Yaril which has emerged triumphant in the battle for the Hindian subcontinent under the name of the Þrumðiland. Observers have questioned whether maybe the alleged blood sacrifices of his inner circle accomplished something after all... how else could Manfred do it than with the aid of the Gods themselves?\n\nThe coronation of a new Yaril, of course, has still not been discussed."

### Leader Desc ###
SAM_VANISTO_DESC:0 "§YBiography§!: Only one and a half years after the end of the Summer Revolution, the rule of Manfred Vanistö threatens to send Sambar into civil war once more. The "Iron Regent", as he is called, has hung on to power through a combination of treachery, intimidation, and bloodlust, and has refused to allow the young Yaril of Sambar to inherit at any costs, despite the deer already of an age to succeed the throne as is his right. Nobles and monarchists stand outraged that the regent will not give up even an inch of his power to the rightful ruler of the country, while an increasingly discontent agrarian population plots another revolution in the shadows, and continues to harass noble holdings across the country, reject conscription, and demand the restoration of a true people's ruler, selected among the ranks of the native Hindians.\n\nThe road ahead is treacherous, but with the power of the navy and the settlers behind him, a ship to Olenia might not be in order for the Iron Regent after all.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: MonAx"

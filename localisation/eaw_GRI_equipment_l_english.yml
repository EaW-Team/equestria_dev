 GRI_gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "The 'Airbender' as it was commonly named, was a result of the early machinegun-on-wheels designs of the Republican Revolution, used by Kemerskai's revolutionaries and later Imperial loyalists. The crude designs later developed into the first early tank design in Griffonia, with the Airbender's main armament consisting of a cannon and machinegun in the front and another machinegun on the back."

 GRI_melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "The musket was instrumental in conquering Griffonia for the Empire, and Imperial line troops have proudly carried variants of the Vorderlader for two centuries from Aquileia to the Riverlands.

When the Vesting was approved in 1012, the situation in North-Western Griffonia had changed and the Vesting became a viable weapon of war."

The designers had taken note of the performance of the Psv. 12 and increased the firepower of the 14, while introducing angled armour to reduce the steel cost for the chassis.

 ### FOCUS ###
 CTL_the_1_year_plan:0 "The Yaril Speaks"
 CTL_the_1_year_plan_desc:0 "The Chitali season of the early dew has begun, and with it, the Yaril must give an address opening the season, promising boons for the great farmers and aristans of Chital and a restoration of the fractured nation's unity and pride. With the current political situation, however, his words might matter more than ever before."

 CTL_call_up_the_nobles:0 "A Meeting With The Three"
 CTL_call_up_the_nobles_desc:0 "Benjen has a year to fix the problems facing Chital by the next Hemanta season - clearly he cannot let the Axis of Chital levy their influence over the Council of Seven at any point in that time. To rectify the issue of Axis influence in the Council, Benjen shall call a meeting for only three of his most trusted advisors, so that he shall only listen to sound policy and rhetoric."

 CTL_deal_with_dannya_shah:0 "Dealing With Dannya Shah"
 CTL_deal_with_dannya_shah_desc:0 "Under the leadership of revolutionary firebrand Dannya Shah, the Chitali People's Liberation Front and its communist allies have continued to grow in power. If we are to quash the growing support for this new ideology of chaos and destruction, we must first send a message to those who would be foolish enough to support them - starting with ending the revolutionary agitation of Dannya Shah."

 CTL_seer_issue:0 "A Summit With The Seers"
 CTL_seer_issue_desc:0 "Traditional Olenian seers still hold positions of high importance at the court of the Yaril, but their presence has been a subject of debate for a long time now. Their influence is upsetting to our native subjects, and their close ties to Yakub the Grey's traditionalist faction worries many of the minor nobility, who fear their power will be threatened. It is finally time to decide once and for all the role of these holy deer."

 CTL_sikh_issue:0 "Dealing With The Tuymaiyānatu"
 CTL_sikh_issue_desc:0 "For hundreds of years, a native religious sect known as the "Tuya" has existed on the political fringe of Chital. In these trying times, the Tuya's charitable actions, as well as its militant defiance of our regime, has attracted new members. Most dangerously, Bhushan the Brash himself, is an adherent. We must address what to do about this movement and fast." 

 CTL_the_fate_of_the_council:0 "Dealing With The Council"
 CTL_the_fate_of_the_council_desc:0 "The Council of Seven was created to calm the concerns of the native nobility, but its successes have been mixed. While it has improved native conditions over the years of its existence, many have come to realize it exists just to support the Yaril's power, causing them to lose their faith in its authority. And now, with factionalism taking hold, Benjen needs to make tough choices regarding its future."
 
 CTL_choosing_an_advisor:0 "Favoring A Faction"
 CTL_choosing_an_advisor_desc:0 "The three factions of the Council each hold significant power throughout Chital. The Yaril possesses his own ambitions of reform and reconstruction, but he may yet be swayed by one of the powerful nobles that sit on the council. The future of Chital shall be decided in these negotiation halls and secretive conversations."

 CTL_on_the_berserkers_desc:0 ""

 CTL_adding_more_yesdeer:0 "A New Face"
 CTL_adding_more_yesdeer_desc:0 "Currently Benjen lacks a comfortable power base where it matters in Chitali politics, and appointing a new advisor to court the favor of one of the many factions in Chital would sure up his support in crucial ways. Now the only question, is who."

 CTL_the_supply_issue:0 "Supplies Against Socialism"
 CTL_the_supply_issue_desc:0 "The southern lands where communists and rebellious nobles roam have always been hard for the Chitali Yarils to control. And now, when the rebels have access to explosives and canons, our logistics have been thrown into disarray. We must establish a continuous supply line to the southern territories so that we can put down this rebellion."

 CTL_pacify_the_south:0 "Ending The CPLF"
 CTL_pacify_the_south_desc:0 "Loyal military units have tracked down the CPLF's final holdout in the southern hills, and we are ready to finally put an end to this. The Yaril, in accordance with tradition, shall lead his forces personally to battle against the rebels. Chital shall be free of them once and for all!"

 CTL_infiltrate_her_entourage:0 "Infiltrate Her Entourage"
 CTL_infiltrate_her_entourage_desc:0 "Many within the CPLF are not true communists, or even truly dedicated to the overthrow of the Yaril, they are discontent and impoverished deer who may yet be brought back to reason with a little convincing. Royal operatives will be dispatched to infiltrate the CPLF and encourage disunity amongst its ranks, how we go about this though may differ..."

 CTL_the_fate_of_the_ringleaders:0 "An Axis Connection"
 CTL_the_fate_of_the_ringleaders_desc:0 "Dannya Shah always seems to be one step ahead of us, and always has a few more guns then we could have accounted for, these discrepancies in planning and logistics have begun to raise eyebrows at the royal court. A letter found in a spice field, bearing Dannya's seal may give us some answers, though we may find ourselves dealing with something larger than the CPLF."

 CTL_taking_back_the_spice:0 "Reclaim The Spices"
 CTL_taking_back_the_spice_desc:0 "The Spice plantations of inland Chital have always been a source of revenue for whoever controls them. In present, they lie in the hands of the southern rebels who use them to secure funds and arms for their efforts. Reclaiming these plantations would secure our regime much-needed funds for the continued conflict."

###HIRA RAMACHAN PATH###
 CTL_ramachan_takes_control:0 "The Spymistress In Control"
 CTL_ramachan_takes_control_desc:0 "The unassuming leader of the Axis of Chital, Madame Hira Ramachan, has taken control of the Yarildom following the disbanding of the Council of Seven. With her goals of a broad populist agenda and a centralization of political power for the natives and her allies, Hira will surely not allow the traitors who have driven Chital into the ground to go unpunished."

 CTL_puppet_jarl:0 "A Puppet Yaril"
 CTL_puppet_jarl_desc:0 "Brienna Kudlinen, the Yaril's cousin and younger sister of Jakub the Grey, has never been active in Chitali politics, and after Jakub and Benjen's removal from the political scene, is technically the heir to the Yarildom. To truly stabilize our government, we must bring a Yaril back to Chital, and Brienna is just the right doe for the job."

 CTL_a_few_loose_ends:0 "A Few Loose Ends"
 CTL_a_few_loose_ends_desc:0 "There are some members of the Chitali nobility that are beyond redemption. Supporters of a traditional Olenian aristocracy have continued to oppose our government, and if they ever took control of Chital again, would surely enslave the Hindians once more. If we wish to ensure the stability of the Ramachan government, these traditionalists must be purged."

 CTL_exile_the_heir:0 "Exile The Grey Viking"
 CTL_exile_the_heir_desc:0 "A vicious enforcer of the whims of the Yaril and his predecessors, Jakub the Grey has left a trail of Hindian blood in his wake. While we surely admire his military prowess, there is no need for him to remain in government any longer, as he has shown himself to only be loyal to the Yaril and his own authority. He must be exiled, as he has most certainly overstayed his welcome."

 CTL_send_out_their_secrets:0 "Selling Secrets"
 CTL_send_out_their_secrets_desc:0 "As the court's de-facto Spymistress for years, Hira Ramachan has developed a certain wealth of information pertaining to the hidden desires and controversial political motives of her previous higher-ups. With the people still skeptical of Madame Hira's newfound position of power, perhaps it is the perfect time to reveal the pleasures, deadly intrigue, and corruption of the Chitali nobility."

 CTL_factionalize_the_crown_loyalists:0 "Split The Resistance"
 CTL_factionalize_the_crown_loyalists_desc:0 "The resistance to the Axis of Chital is prone to ideological squabbling of their own, especially the traditonalists and the reformists, who, even with completely different philosophies, have united against Madame Hira and the Axis. Our efforts must be furthered to factionalize the resistance, so that it pains Jakub the Grey and Benjen Davirtannen to even look at eachother."

 CTL_bhushan_as_deputy:0 "Appoint Bhushan As Deputy"
 CTL_bhushan_as_deputy_desc:0 "Bhushan Gurat has served as Ramachan's greatest ally in the government and in the Axis for years. Lord Ivar may be a dignified figurehead for some deer, but Bhushan is the epitome of the spirit of the people of Chital. A protector of the native culture and way of life and staunch agrarian populist, Bhushan is what Chital needs as its deputy, not more prancing nobles with minds only for themselves."

 CTL_work_with_hoversholm:0 "Work With Lord Ivar"
 CTL_work_with_hoversholm_desc:0 "Bhushan Gurat's position in government is a complicated situation, but one thing remains clear - that he is not the correct candidate to serve as Hira's right hand deer, especially because of his radical ideology. Ivar Hoversholm, although not a particularly inspiring personality, is a comptent administrator and good friend to Madame Hira, and so shall take Bhushan's place as unofficial second-in-command."

 CTL_an_axis_eternal:0 "Cement The Axis"
 CTL_an_axis_eternal_desc:0 "Chital is the Axis, and the Axis is Chital. With the legacy of the corrupt monarchy of the Kudlinens all but eradicated and a puppet monarch installed loyal to the populist goals of the Axis, it appears that a new dawn is finally in reach for Chital. Now, Hira must turn her eyes to the opposition that still lurks in the shadows... and on the world stage."

 CTL_restructure_the_army:0 "Aboilsh Viking Priveleges"
 CTL_restructure_the_army_desc:0 "Jakub the Grey and his murderous raiders may have once been an influential part of Chitali society, but now, they are simply a useless relic of Chital's bloodstained past. The high position of these deer in society must end, and their ancient priveleges must finally be abolished, so that an egalitarian Chital can rise."

 CTL_their_outdated_customs:0 "Repair Our Reputation"
 CTL_their_outdated_customs_desc:0 "Too many of our Hindian brothers view Chital's leaders as wretched imperialists, who have continued to oppress the natives of our nation even under Ramachan's government. This cannot be further from the truth. Our international policy must entail returning to the world stage as a friend to all Hindians, and an ally to all the opressed of Zebrica."

 CTL_open_economy:0 "An Economy For The Hindians"
 CTL_open_economy_desc:0 "For too long have the honourable people of Chital been beaten down by an economic and social order that cares only for their own image. We must chart a new course that can end the oppression of our Hindian brothers, but to do so, we must bring in some actual economic advisors not focused on lining their pockets."

 CTL_break_the_system:0 "Tear Down The Council"
 CTL_break_the_system_desc:0 "The Council of Seven is above all, an undemocratic structure, designed to oppress the interests of the Axis of Chital and the Chitali people. It has only served to strengthen the authority of Yaril Benjen and his puppets, all the while maintaing a farce of democratic governance in Chital. The Council of Seven must be abolished, if we are to truly cement the Axis and bring an end to the Yaril's lies."

 CTL_democratic_pretenses:0 "Just And Democratic Pretenses"
 CTL_democratic_pretenses_desc:0 "Hira and the Axis gained power on promises of populism and anti-elitism, and for that reason, it is clear that the Council of Seven and the oligarchic values it represented would be better left in the past. A Chitali Assembly, with elected representatives from across Hindia, would be a better advisory legislature to Brienna I and Madame Hira than any undemocratic privy council could ever be."

 CTL_redistribute_political_power:0 "Constituents Ruling Constituents"
 CTL_redistribute_political_power_desc:0 "Should the people of Chital not rule themselves, as they had for centuries before the barbaric Olenians first landed on our fair shores? It should be the deer themselves that decide who reprsents them and what the path of Chital should be, not an unelected Oleno-Hindian minority, and certainly not a Axis of Chital dictatorship that would be just as undemocratic. Democracy must come to Chital!"

 CTL_religious_syncretism:0 "A Syncretist Platform"
 CTL_religious_syncretism_desc:0 "Hira has never been a particularly religious doe, viewing it more as a social and political tool than an actual moral truth. However, Chital is a deeply religious nation, and simply declaring the nation a secular state would inspire mass resistance. Knowing that, we shall use religion as a tool to encourage unity and comradery between all free Hindians of Chital, even if we have to edit some funamental tenets."
 
 CTL_gurus_as_teachers:0 "Protecting Mahimata's Vision"
 CTL_gurus_as_teachers_desc:0 "Mahimata, the mother goddess of Mahimatism, is a core part of Chitali life, and her teachings have guided hundreds of thousands if not millions of Chitalis. Instead of dividing ourselves among Hindian and Olenian lines, we must unite under our common faith and Mahmiata's vision of an agrarian, protected, and integrated Chital."

 CTL_seers_as_propagandists:0 "The Traditionalist In The Room"
 CTL_seers_as_propagandists_desc:0 "Seer Konor has been reluctant to accept any reforms that remove the dominance of Seers in the Chitali religious scene, continually claiming that they are the only party that can bring about a return to Chital tradition. Unfortunately, he does not seem to be placatable, and continually has held back pro-native and progressive reform. Him and his allies must be marginalized, or somehow... dealt with."

 CTL_a_new_elite:0 "A Better, Hindian, Elite"
 CTL_a_new_elite_desc:0 "A new Council of Seven shall be formed for the benefit of the nation, but this time, it will not be overrun by absolutist traitors and controlled opposition without a voice. This time, the Council of Seven will serve Chital, its people, and especially the natives, above all. Ramachan's loyalists may hold all the seats, but if the people prosper, is that inherently negative?"

 CTL_only_the_loyal:0 "Shadow Government"
 CTL_only_the_loyal_desc:0 "The Council of Seven was not fundamentally terrible. While the original design was a complete failure, there is always a possibility the aristocratic design of the Council can be used for something greater. Reforming the Council of Seven to serve the Axis and the people, not the crooked elite, would ensure stable, strong governance, even if it denies the people "democracy"."

 CTL_radical_industrialization:0 "Intervention For The People"
 CTL_radical_industrialization_desc:0 "If our government and economic advisory council would decide to follow a strictly capitalist system, the same structural inequalities that characterized the past Chitali regime would rise up again, and the Hindians would be worse off for it. Instead, we must follow a policy of state intervention so that our govermnent can alleviate such inequalities first hand, before they spring up again."

 CTL_control_economy:0 "Steer The Economy"
 CTL_control_economy_desc:0 ""

 CTL_expropriate_the_nobles:0 "Expropriate The Traitors"
 CTL_expropriate_the_nobles_desc:0 "Northern industrial elites have ran the country with the support of the Ostkranbi monarchy and their lackeys in the council for too long!\n\n It is time we teach the remaining oligarchs and capitalists of the North a lesson, so Hira's vision of justice can finally be completed."


 
 ### HOVERSHOLM TREE ###
 CTL_the_last_true_statesdeer:0 "The Last True Statesdeer"
 CTL_the_last_true_statesdeer_desc:0 "Ivar Hoversholm is the last true protector of Chital! He has thrown off the corrupt monarchs who have lead the nation astray, and masterfully deceived the petulant Axis who aimed to rip the nation to shreds! He is the epitome of the true statesdeer and has earned the right to lead us into the future!"

 CTL_an_axis_without_purpose:0 "Leave The Axis Behind"
 CTL_an_axis_without_purpose_desc:0 "The Axis has outlived its usefulness to us. It's foundations are outdated and despotic, fated to turn into the same monarchist ploy Ivar so valiantly overthrew.

 CTL_southern_connections:0 "Our Most Loyal Opposition"

Surely Hira Ramachan will accept an official visit to her domain in Haarihus, asking an important question - how does the position of leader of the opposition sound?

 CTL_native_resistance_desc:0 "With support for radical movements exacerbated by the modern movements for harmony, natural rights, and independence throughout the world, the native Chitalis have grown discontent with the current government of Benjen V and the Council of Seven. Many of the natives have begun a policy of complete opposition to the Oleno-Hindian native landed elite, who they believe do not truly represent the people of Chital. If the goverment does not deal with these newfound native tensions quickly, then it could have a crisis on its hooves. With growing support for the Hindian nobility faction in the Council of Seven, the Axis of Chital, along with an increase in militant leftist and republican activity, often sponsored by these same nobles, it is imperative that our government restore balance to Chital, before the Yarildom is swept away by internal turmoil."

Committed to anti-government politics and a desire to change Chital for the better, the Axis supports strengthening Hindian positions and fixing the disparity in power between the landed Oleno-Hindian elite and the commondeer. Given seats on the Council of Seven during the first years of Benjen's reign, the Axis has continued to be a thorn in the monarchy's side, even supporting republican movements at points to sabotage the rule of House Kudlinen.

Opening the document, he began to read...\n\n"To the shadow of Chital,\n\nYou are close to letting your ego get the better of you, I caution you to not probe me for any further action, lest you put our efforts at risk\n\nThough I am thankful for the shipment of weapons, the Yaril came to close to finding them.

Who in their right mind would write something like this? At its core, it is a letter to an ally, but why veiled threats? And this "shadow of Chital" talk made Benjen nervous. Though at the same time, he could not help but chuckle at what he read, it truly was a unique specimen.\n\nBut who was this to? Who was providing weapons to the rebels? Wait... the shadow of Chital...\n\n"Could it be Hira?" Benjen wondered to himself, turning to the bed in his study beside him, he spoke to the doe sleeping beneath its sheets. "Ruusu, my dear, could you fetch me a member of the royal police?" The only response from the bed were dreaming groans, "It seems I will need to do this myself." Benjen thought.

chital.28.d:0 "The efforts of Madame Hira to finally syncretize Mahimatism and the associated religions and worships of the Seers of old Olenia have culminated in a great conference at Montaba, with the goal of finally putting the religious divides of Chital to rest.\n\nThe main advisor at Court serving the Seers was Konor, a staunch follower of Ukko and opponent to what he calls "the primitive pagan rituals of a bygone era". For the past weeks, he has continued to badger Ramachan over her reluctancy to enshrine the Seers as the official leaders of Chitali religious life, declaring that the Yarildom's devotion to the traditional values of Olenian religious culture must come first, before any populist promises or democratic reforms.\n\n"If we give the Mahimatists and their backwards, destructive ideology any more power, they will eradicate the entire vision of the seers as we know it, and make this country some kind of primitivist mother cult devoted to the destruction of all of the gains the Yaril's government has made in the past few years," Konor had angrily said during the conference, slamming his hoof upon the table, "The Tuya are terrorists, and the Mahimatists have allowed them to operate, cleansing the countryside of all opposition to the Yaril! What Chital needs is tradition, glory, and to be ruled by the Olenians and their Gods again. If any syncretism must be done, I say, Mahimata shall only reign as a goddess within the pantheon, and among equals."\n\nKonor's doctrine of the supremacy of the Olenian temples, however, have been challenged by others at the court, especially Bhushan Gurat, a member of the Axis of Chital and close friend to Hira Ramachan. Bhushan, a member of the Tuymaiyānatu religious militia and staunch devotee of the Hindian religion, has proposed that if the religions are ever unified, Mahimata should rank above the other gods as a mother figure in accordance with core Mahimatist monotheistic principles.\n\n"Konor is incorrect, clearly, and continues to spew his propaganda about Mahimatist principles and Mahimata as a goddess," Bhushan declared, "Mahimata is the mother of all Hindians, and the Olenians would only like to see us return to the corrupt modernism of the vapid Olenian temple system. They would have us destroy our lands, end our traditional structures, and eradicate our own culture so that we can return to some kind of "sound" governance." "His ideology is as foolish as it is harmful," Bhushan continued, "And I implore Hira, above all, to enshrine Mahimata as the official head of the pantheon and goddess of Chital.""

chital.29.d:0 "While still maintaining her own power as Chital's Chief Minister and "Diwan", Madame Hira has kept her word on her promises to reform Chital's political and economic systems, and has formally announced for Chital's first legislative elections.\n\nRepresentatives from both Hindian and Olenian constituencies shall elect candidates to Chital's new Assembly, where they shall decide on the day-to-day governance of the nation, subject only to the personal objections of Hira and the young Yaril Brienna, who has already come under the Chief Minister's sway. Although many have raised issues about decaying infrastructure and a long, arduous trip to Chital's capital to serve on the National Assembly, Hira's followers have looked on the move very favorably. With turnout expected to be high in even agrarian areas, Hira's advisors have been hard at work providing for polling infrastructure across Chital's southern territories.\n\nTwo parties have developed to serve in the National Assembly's first session, and although Hira will remain Chief Minister of the nation regardless of the majority party in the Council, the parties' ideologies have remained distinct. The Chitali People's Party, founded by a coalition of rehabilitated CPLF members, Hira's personal advisors, and former followers of the Axis of Chital, has positioned itself as a big-tent populist party, supporting land reform, agrarianism, and the Chief Minister. On the democratic right, the Liberal Party of Chital has developed, founded by Olenian reformists and coastal citizens. Supporting free-market capitalism and the expansion of democratic institutions across the nation, they have been criticized by the opposition for a lack of Chitali cultural awareness and desire to make Chital "more like the rest of the world".\n\nInevitably, the elections were won by..."

All loyalists and sympathizers of the Axis of Chital, Ivar Hoversholm, Elik Baronnen, Bhushan Gurat, and even Eva Pillai, one of Benjen's old enforcers, were called to attend, but Hira had kept the details secretive, as she always did. The only details were that it was of vital importance, and that it would herald in a new dawn for Chital.\n\n"I shall explain our mission to you quickly, before we move onto the direct work of the Council itself. We all know that the original Council of Seven failed in each regard, so much so that Benjen had to start appointing even more and more yesdeer to serve his interests and root out the true voices of Chital. Let us all remember that the idea of the Council of Seven was not inherently bad - of course, we, the nobility and leaders of Chital, should run the nation, but the reckless elitism and disregard for the common Chitali was what set the Council apart as a uniquely disugsting institution."\n\nHira cleared her throat, then continued. "It is for that reason that I have called you here - to rise from the ashes of the old council and bring a new system for Chital, one that does not pretend to support the voices of all Chitali, but one that does what it says it will. A council that prioritizes the people and strengthens its own legitimacy, all at the same time."\n\n"That..." she paused. "Is the Chial we shall build.""

Although many in the court suspect Hira is using Bhushan as a front for her own operations, the new rebellion has taken up the name and flag of the Tuymaiyānatu, a native religious sect determined to protect their lands and faith from what they believe is an encroachment by a foreign Yaril. Bhushan, a staunch member of the organization and one of the movement's leaders, has declared already that Benjen wants "nothing but to see our ancient customs and traditions anihillated under the boot of what he calls progress."\n\nOur scouts believe the Tuymaiyānatu have a significant prescence in Hira's domain in Haarihus, along with Bhushan's in Mahorna. Interestingly enough, Bhushan and his warlords have also managed to take much of the native province of Gondeerana, controlled by Axis sympathizer Eva Pillai. If the native Eva Pillai decides to let the rebels into the city itself, nation-wide turmoil could endure, and the Yaril's reign over all of Chital might even be threatened.\n\nThe situation is grim, and all eyes are on the Yaril's next move to answer the rebellion."

Thankfully, none of those protests reached the site of the port itself, and Aattohamn now stands as a possible landing ground for an invasion of [SRI.GetName], or simply a center of trade to facilitate the mass amounts of Chitali spices exported to Macawia and the Griffonian South.\n\nAlthough debates have erupted on the usage of the port, postponing much of Chital's political activity, one proposal has made its way through - a motion to dedicate Aattohamn to the Chitali workers who built the port town. While squabbling continued on the matter of what the port town should actually be dedicated to, the spirit of the proposal itself has seen widespread support. All that is left to decide about the future of the new hub of commerce and naval engineering, it seems, is the exact dedication."

 CTL_BENJEN_DESC:0 "§YДата Рождения§!: 6 Июня 975 года, в Осткранби\n\n§YБиография§!: Говорят, что нет покоя голове в венце; Про Бенджена V Кудлинена, Ярила Читала и стойкого реформиста лучше и не скажешь: со всех сторон его окружают дворяне, предавшие его бывшие союзники и бессердечные революционеры.\n\nБенджен V никогда и не был воином, в отличие от Королей Морей континента из прошлого - рейдеров, которые безжалостно грабили Восточные берега Зебрики и покоряли местных Оленей, таким образом укрепляя свою влать от Самбара до Доули. Он родился в Осткранби, столице Читала, как наследник Бенджена IV Кудлинена. Бенджена V обучали управлению с детства. Умный и красноречивый юный олень смог быстро найти друзей среди многочисленных детей дворян и даже более старых оленей при дворе, и его за это хвалил отец, пусть и Бенджен-младший не был особо трудолюбивым. Даже после смерти отца в 998, и после того, как его брат Аатто стал Ярилом Читала, Бенджен оставался коммуникабельным и был готов взять на себя обязанности главного советника своего брата.\n\nПравда, жизнь Ярила вскоре резко оборвалась. Аатто погиб в 1001, в ходе подавления восстания местных, потому Бенджену пришлось принять на себя бразды правления династии Кудлинен. Его главные советники разорвали его помолвку с его суженой, простой оленихой, потому у Бенджена осталось Ярилство, в котором его осуждают, как толстого государственника и женоподобного труса - зовут его "Добрый Викинг". Бенджен постепенно заменял советников Аатто своими старыми друзьями, и кульминацией его правления стало учреждения Совета Семи в 1003 - по задумке, консультативный совет из Хиндийских и Оленийских дворян, все из которых верны Ярилу. Увы, его соперники в Совете стали его осуждать, и трое его самых важных советников организовались в Ось Читала, чтобы ограничить, как они считают, грубое превышение полномочий и неумение проводить реформы.\n\nТак как Совет стаёт всё более и более враждебным, кажется, что Бенджену нужно действовать быстро, если он желает сберечь Читал - и свою династию.\n\n§YАвтор портрета§!: MonAx"
 
 CTL_IVAR_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 29th of July, 966 in Waldenland\n\n§YBiography§!: Five years ago, Ivar Hoversholm was the most powerful deer in the Chitali government, one of the Yaril's closest friends and most competent advisors. Now, however, he is a shell of his former self, disgraced among the nobility, and comsumed with a cold, silent hatred for all of the traitors that now rule his nation.\n\nBorn in Waldenland to a caring noble family, Ivar Hoversholm was considered a gifted child, and recieved much praise and respect from his teachers and the Waldenland court, a great insult to his twin sister, Katarina, who would inevitably play a part in his downfall. A rising star in Chitali politics, Ivar and his father, Elik, became voices of reformism, populism, and the rule of law on then Yaril Benjen IV's council. When Elik resigned his courtly duties out of old age in 1000, Ivar became even more influential in the coastal nation's court. Close friendships with industrialist Benjen Davirtannen and then heir to throne Benjen Kudlinen made Ivar a prime candidate for a spot on the Yaril's advisory council, which would eventually become the Council of Seven in 1003.\n\nHowever, with the establishment of the Council of Seven, came Ivar's undoing. A founding member of the Axis of Chital, Hoversholm saw the Yaril supporting what in his eyes were elitist and purge-happy philosophies espoused by the court's so-called reformists, but Benjen, to Ivar's shame, would not listen. With his influence supplanted by a new brand of reformist, the Axis drifting further and further from the reformism Ivar still staunchly supported, and his friendship with the Yaril waning, Ivar began to attend the Council less and less, and continued to spend his time in Waldenland, dreaming up elaborate ways where he could restore his power, and take vengeance on those who had disgraced him.\n\nNow, it seems, his dreams have finally come true.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: bunnyshrubby"

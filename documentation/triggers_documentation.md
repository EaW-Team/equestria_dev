## custom_override_tooltip

* Supported Scopes: any
* Supported Targets: none

An `AND` trigger that has an overriden custom tooltip.

If no positive tooltip is provided and the root key is a localization key (not a formatter, see [formatted localization](script_concept_documentation.md#formatted_localization)),
then a negative tooltip will be generated by appending `_NOT` to the root localization for the positive tooltip.
Both tooltip and `not_tooltip` are [bindable localizations](script_concept_documentation.md#bindable_localization).

### Examples
```
custom_override_tooltip = {
	tooltip = MY_TOOLTIP # Simple loc key tooltip
	not_tooltip = MY_TOOLTIP_NOT
	<other triggers>
}
```
```
custom_override_tooltip = {
	tooltip = MY_TOOLTIP
	# Implicit:
	#not_tooltip = MY_TOOLTIP_NOT
	<other triggers>
}
```
```
custom_override_tooltip = {
	tooltip = {
		localization_key = MY_TOOLTIP # Root look key
		IMPORTANT_QUESTION = { # ID IMPORTANT_QUESTION in MY_TOOLTIP will get value:
			localization_key = MEANING_OF_LIFE # Root loc key in IMPORTANT_QUESTION
			ANSWER = "42" # ID ANSWER in IMPORTANT_QUESTION will get value 42
		}
		JUST_AS_IMPORTANT = OR_NOT # ID JUST_AS_IMPORTANT in MY_TOOLTIP will get value OR_NOT
	}
	# Implicit:
	# not_tooltip = {
	#	localization_key = MY_TOOLTIP_NOT
	#	IMPORTANT_QUESTION = {

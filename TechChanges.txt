- Infantry has additional small techs, as well as a pair of pre-industrial techs.
- Non-BBA Jet stats have been completely overhauled, to make them a clearer upgrade and have more reasonable ability curve.
- NSB heavy tank chassis production cost has been reduced by 10%
- NSB super-heavy tank chassis production cost has been reduced from 24 to 17
- Non-NSB super-heavy tank production cost has been reduced from 100 to 40 (to account for the increase per battalion from 15 to 40)
- BBA anti-ship missiles and fixed explosive charge targetting increased to 15 from 10
- Early ICBMs have been delayed from 1017 to 1023, and a new "Advanced Short Range Rocket" has been added in 1017

- BBA medium bomb bay logi strike capacity quadrupled.
- BBA all other logi strike except machine guns/aircraft cannons halved.

The following changes are in effect from vanilla techs. This does not include additions except when they fall into the tech folder's original end date (for example, the extended support weapons tech in infantry).
- Armored car org and HP have been doubled
- Heavy cruiser cannons (medium cannons) have had some of their heavy attack moved to light attack
- All non-MTG ships use MTG stats and modules
- Floating Fortress doctrine increases battlecruiser org as well as battleship org
- Infantry has additional small techs, as well as a pair of pre-industrial techs.
- Non-BBA Jet stats have been completely overhauled, to make them a clearer upgrade and have more reasonable ability curve.
- NSB heavy tank chassis production cost has been reduced by 10%
- NSB super-heavy tank chassis production cost has been reduced from 24 to 17
- Non-NSB super-heavy tank production cost has been reduced from 100 to 40 (to account for the increase per battalion from 15 to 40)

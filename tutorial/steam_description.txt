[h1]Equestria at War[/h1] is a mod that tries to recreate the fantasy world of Equestria from My Little Pony franchise in a slightly darker setting with industrialization, corruption and political disagreements. The scenario focuses on global confrontation between Changelings and Equestria.

[h1]“Herzland” 1.7.1[/h1]

There was a time when most of Griffonia was united under one Crown, ruled from the Herzland. A time when the Imperial army was the dread of the known world and all griffons spoke of the splendour and wealth funnelled to its heart. That time is no more. The Empire is but a shadow of its former self, the Heart of its territory divided amongst unruly vassals led by an Emperor on death’s door. And while the Emperor’s friends sharpen their claws to fight over his legacy, the rest of the Imperial Heartlands prepare for troubling times. 

The fiefs nominally loyal to the Empire are diverse, with the loyal dogs of the County of Bronzehill, the Duchy of Strawberry led by powerful Gabriela Eagleclaw, the free but frail Peasant Republic of Greifenmarschen, the intellectuals of the Yale Rectorate, the mad Princess of Katerin and the vicious Baron of Angriver along with the Grand Duchy of Feathisia and the City of Romau. All these vassals are preparing for crisis. But with great crises come great opportunities…

Yet more lands are linked to Griffenheim via history. On the west coast, money rules in Skyfall and Fezera, but where Skyfall is ruled by ruthless capitalists, Fezera houses greedy criminals. The Haukland islands are now the domain of the flying ace known as Meyer, a rogue styling himself ruler. House Avian rules an independent land, but must grow in strength or risk being trampled on, the same fate to which the small lake island of Rumare seems destined to. Lastly the Garden City of Flowena shelters the fortunes of Griffonia’s wealthy. 

As Grover V, the Emperor, boards his train to visit his many subjects one last time, the pages of history turn once more. Although the Heartlands are now divided, its people share a single history. It would take a mighty ruler to take charge in Griffenheim and bring down their rivals. But then again, the Heartland has a history of mighty rulers…

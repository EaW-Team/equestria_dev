[h1]“Daring Do and the Yaks that SMASH!” 2.3[/h1]

Deep within the frigid mountains of northern Equus lay some of the fiercest warriors the world has ever seen: The mighty Kingdom of Yakyakistan. With traditions older than memory and pride matched only by their strength, the clans within this realm serve under the guidance of Prince Rutherford, firstborn of the late King Winford. But not all yaks agree with Rutherford's rule, and some of them whisper to one another about his unpopular decree to open their borders to the ponies in the south...

Among those who have opposed Rutherford's decisions are his younger brother, Prince Bradford, along with a multitude of clans in the east that have united into the Jaki-Clan. These yaks have fought a great war with their brethren to the west - one that ended in an uneasy truce as there was no clear victor. Now Bradford's situation grows more and more dire as his supplies, morale, and public support edge closer to drying up with each passing day...

Even further to the east lays the land of Nova Griffonia, a former colony of the once-great Griffonian Empire. Long ago, these griffon colonists drove some of the yaks out of their ancestral homeland, and ever since, there has been tension between the two races. Unfortunately, that is not the only problem that plagues this nation: When the Griffonian Empire underwent a revolution thirty years ago, the resulting outcome utterly destroyed Nova Griffonia's economy, leaving its governor, Teafeather, low on funds and even lower on options to recover. Still, he holds the country together through sheer force of will, but will that peace last?

Peace, as it turns out, has now become a pipe dream for the ponies of Equestria. With the return of Nightmare Moon and the subsequent splintering of Equestria into multiple pieces, the reality of the Lunar Empire's control on the eastern half of Equestria became apparent as several resistance movements broke out, one of which is led by none other than the worldwide famous storybook character Daring Do. The odds may be stacked against this Celestial Resistance, but with such a legendary figure leading the charge, they might just earn their happy ending.

With such diverse nations with new stories to tell, what great and terrible changes might come to the continent of Equus? Will a mighty yak become an even mightier khan and achieve a grand victory over their enemies? Will Nova Griffonia survive problems both internal and external? Will the Celestial Resistance manage to unite the southeastern region of Equestria and be forced to deal with the reality of what has happened to the rest of their home? Or will they all fall to darkness? The choices are yours, and yours alone!

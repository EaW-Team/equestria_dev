[h1]“Bears and Bandits” 2.1[/h1]

At the edges of civilisation, where few dare to wander, one can find the most eclectic societies, but they are no different from the others in their squabbles.

Twenty years after the revolution of outlaws, partisans, and Old Believers that liberated Adelart from the yoke of the Greifwaldians and their Aquileian overlords, Adelart and its green glades once again stand at the precipice of subjugation. Beset by internal strife and haunted by the impending return of its former sheriff, hardened in his own twenty years of exile, the fractured coalition of zealots, believers, idealists, and merry griffs must become something more than just a bandit confederation held together by sheer force of will... or convince their citizens fraternity transcends all boundaries after all.

Meanwhile on the northern shores of Equus, the polar bears have recently banded together into a modern civilization. Paw Wellington, a mighty warrior who brought the clans together, will soon be entering his fifth year of rule. His position, however, is not certain, and the clans still chafe under his rule. But with the Changelings to the southwest, they may need to learn to cooperate. Can the bears hold on and avoid being conquered by their ancient foes?

History will tell if the bears and bandits can overcome their challenges, or end up fizzling out like stars in the night.

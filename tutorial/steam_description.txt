[h1]“Cats and Dogs” 2.4[/h1]

On the northwestern coast of Zebrica lies the ancient Kingdom of Abyssinia, proud inheritors of more than a thousand-year-old culture. But like so many on the continent, their lands were ravaged by the Storm King, and as a result King Gomez Mawkonnen's mental state has started to falter.

Further still, the kingdom faces many challenges, with scheming nobles, unruly slaves, and the possibility of a famine looming above it all. Perhaps with the help of his wife, Gomez can weather the storm and finally bring Abyssinia to the prosperous future for which he worked so hard before the mad yeti foiled his plans.

Meanwhile, in Griffonia, the loyal dogs of Bronzehill cherish their Emperor, whose great-grandfather graciously gifted the lands to the runaway slaves from Diamond Mountain. But the county faces an increasingly contentious political scene, in which Count Ignatius sees his rule challenged by the demands for more political representation.

Consequently, the declining health of Grover V has many dogs worried, as the regency that would follow his early death could prove to be a turning point in Bronzehillian history. Amidst the troubles, the only thing all dogs agree upon is their unwavering support for the Griffonstone dynasty.

[h1]🌵 Sundered South 1.6 🌴[/h1]

Chaos reigns in Equestria. Nightmare Moon has returned and in the rural and inhospitable lands down south information about what exactly transpired is sparse and open to interpretation. However, as civil war rages up north, down south fringe movements are cast into the spotlight as Equestrian power disappears from the region overnight. 

In the South-West the call for independence, once a fringe movement, has manifested itself. The Confederacy of Southern States now has the task to forge a national identity while many still yearn to rejoin Equestria. Powerful business interests in Las Pegasus have forced the city to follow the Confederacy’s example and secede, much against the wishes of the common ponies. Now the mayor faces a struggle to keep Las Pegasus neutral and to prevent radicals from taking over the gem of the west coast. 

Meanwhile, in the jungles of the east, the ancient homeland of the batponies, many have rallied to support the Empress of the Night. As Stars Whirl rallies her military and irregular assets to sweep across the jungles, they find more than the forces of Equestria opposing them. Doctor Caballeron, famed archaeologist, has used his sizable wealth to help the natives of the land they call Aztlan against the radical lunarists. Further north, Baltimare, the biggest city in the South East, has risen up in revolution. Without Equestria to protect them, Golden Delicious rallied the workers to defend themselves. But the socialists are deeply divided even as they fight the common threats around them, and it remains to be seen if they can maintain a united front.  

As the battle lines are drawn in the populous north of Equestria, the warring alicorns are temporarily distracted from the fighting on the fringes of what was once the most powerful nation on the planet. However, the emergent nations are small and rife with their own issues. Will these new states fall to whoever wins the civil war, or will they manage to unite the Sundered South?

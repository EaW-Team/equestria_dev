[h1]“The Way of Fire” 2.2[/h1]

A new day is dawning in Zebrica, and as the curtains are drawn back on the orchestra, the conductor raises her baton and a single hopeful note breaks a century of silence.

For the past one hundred years, the Realm of Kiria has stagnated in undisturbed isolation, completely closed off from the outside world. Great cities have been emptied and the waterways that once connected the mighty nation lie unused as the Kirian people scratch out a poor existence on subsistence farms. Under the decrees of the Matriarch Superior collectively known as The Silence, the Realm forcefully closed itself off to debate, discussion, and innovation to control the fiery tempers of its people, tempers that if enraged transform them into monsters of fire and violence. A once mighty nation fell silent to prevent itself from being consumed by flames.

But for the first time in a century, things are beginning to change. Following the unexpected visit of an Equestrian delegation, Matriarch Superior Rain Shine has revoked The Silence and now welcomes kirin to the capital of Vermilion to undo the damage wrought by generations of stagnation. For the first time in a hundred years, the kirin of the Realm have the chance to sing a new song—but with scores of different voices and ideas suddenly shouting to be heard above the others, can Kiria chart a course to move forward in harmonic symphony, or will the orchestra descend into a cacophony that leaves the Realm yearning for another century of silence?

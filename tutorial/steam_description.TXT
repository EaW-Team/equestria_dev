[h1]🏞 Riverlands 1.3 🏞[/h1]

East of the Griffon Empire, at the fringes of griffon society, live the ponies of the Riverlands. Ousted by the crusading forces of the Empire, these ponies, having neither alicorns nor elements of harmony to safeguard them, were forced into a pact, bringing in together ponies of numerous backgrounds into the Coltstream Pact. Together, they form the River Coalition, prepared to face any reprisals from their old griffon foes, be they the Hellquillian Knights, the genocidal Longswordians, or the cossacks of the Gryphian Host.

There are those within the Coalition that dream of a Riverlands united under a single federal power. However, with eight different member countries, each with its own goals and drives, only one can bring about a River Federation; Such a road shall be wrought with obstacles and troubles. Will it be forged by the Lake City of Jezeragrad, prosperous Rijekogard, the arcane Kingdom of Wittenburg, harmonious Pònaidhean, militant Nimbusia, or the industrious diamond dogs of Diamond Mountain? All are competing, but only one will realise those dreams… 

Meanwhile, to the north of the River Coalition, the isolated pony lands and island of Greneclyf, long since left to their own devices, are stirring to action. Ghostly whispers snake through the trees of the Firtree Villages, and rumour abound of a great incident that will befall those lands. Farbrook, on the other hoof, faces the prospect of industrialisation, and with it, the internal and external challenges of being the Star of the North. Their curious friends, the harmonious changelings of Greneclyf, have long sought to have a greater impact in the wider world, and their hives are abuzz with the hope of meeting new friends on the continent.

From warmongers to pacifists, to traditionalists and visionaries, the Riverlands update will bring a wealth of new and unique nations to Equestria at War.

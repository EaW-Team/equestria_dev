As the Griffonian Emperor’s health begins to fail, the Grand Duchy of Feathisia stands strong. Guided by Gerlach IV Weijermars, the nation has known a time of peace and prosperity as a constitutional monarchy. However, with economic instability rocking the nation and with concerns about their overlord mounting, the citizens of Feathisia might just break up the centrist coalition that rules them and search for a new solution. Will harmony and nobility be able to defend the nation against a resurgent Empire or will one of the radical parties be brought into power to save the Grand Duchy?

As the unstable Wingbardian Kingdom decides its own fate, the neighbouring Principality of Falcor watches on. Will they preserve their way of life, or will they turn to drastic measures to keep the Wingbardian radicals from taking over their nation?

In the barren north, an ancient story enters a new chapter. In the Dread Lands, dark magic incantations can be heard from Magehold. As Rosa Maledicta plans her Dark Crusade, the Arcturian Order rallies to face her undead forces. Who will win the mythic conflict between good and evil? Either way, both sides have new plans for the future.

❈ New focuses, events and flavour for countries:
- Feathisia
- Falcor
- Dread League
- Arcturian Order
❈ New art and bugfixes
❈ New UI features

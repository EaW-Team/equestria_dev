[h1] 1.1 üå∏ "Poppy" üå∏ [/h1]

Reinforcements arrive from across the sea as New Mareland takes its place in the world, ready to come to their Mother Nation‚Äôs defence in their time of need. But when Equestria needs them most, will they answer the call? Or will they seek their own path?

The cities of Flowena and Romua stand as proud jewels of the former Empire, but corruption, decadence and a desire for change have left them unstable. With radicals, conservatives and revolutionaries ready to take control, will they be able to survive against the resurgent Empire?

And to the north, in the cold Whitetail Mountains the Bandit Leader Eriviar has forged a deal with the Emperor, but with imperial dissidents flooding into the mountains has thrown Eriviar's fiefdom into chaos. Unable to cope with the stress, the future of the Whitetail Mountains is uncertain.

One way or another. Blood will be spilled, and bodies will forever lie in fields of poppies.

‚ùà New focus trees, events and flavour for countries:
	‚ú¢ New Mareland - Including Solar Empire, Nightmare Moon and other paths.
	‚ú¢ Sunstriker Clan
	‚ú¢ Flowena
	‚ú¢ Romau
	‚ú¢ Crystal Province (Solar Empire Puppet)

Files in this folder control the layout of the visual representation of
equipment in the equipment designer window, along with the equipment module
slots and modules as they would appear on the equipment.

For any given equipment variant design, the appropriate top-level container
window is found by searching for the following named windows, in the same order
of priority as they are listed here:

	"equipment_designer_" EQUIPMENT_TYPE "_" COUNTRY_TAG
	"equipment_designer_" EQUIPMENT_ARCHETYPE "_" COUNTRY_TAG
	"equipment_designer_" EQUIPMENT_TYPE
	"equipment_designer_" EQUIPMENT_ARCHETYPE

Within these equipment designer windows for a specific piece of equipment,
there is an inner container window named "module_slots".  Each module slot
that is possible for any equipment using this designer window should have
its own container window inside here, using the same name as the module slot.

Inside a module slot container window, further container windows should be
listed, corresponding to the modules that can be installed in that module slot.
Within them, you can include the iconType elements or any other elements
appropriate for displaying the associated module on the equipment for that slot.

When a particular module is installed in a slot, the proper module window is
found by searching for the following named windows, in the same order of priority
as they are listed here:

	MODULE_NAME
	MODULE_GFX_NAME
	MODULE_CATEGORY_NAME
	MODULE_SLOT_NAME

In addition to the main elements used to visually represent each possible
module, highlight elements can be included which will be shown when attention
is to be given to a specific module slot and its contents.  These follow the
same naming scheme as the module, with "@hightlight" appended to the end.

If no highlight is found for the module name, GFX name, or category name, then
the container window simply named "@highlight" with nothing before the "@" will
be used instead, if it is available.  This could be something as simple as a
rectangle outline of approximately the correct size, and positioned at the
module slot location.

Here is an abbreviated example of the structure:

	containerWindowType = {
		name = "equipment_designer_ship_hull_heavy_1_USA" # name of equipment archetype or type, with optional country tag
		# other window attributes...

		# Primary image for the equipment
		iconType = {
			name = "equipment_image"
			spriteType = "GFX_ED_heavy_hull"
			position = { x=0 y=0 }
		}

		# Container window for all of the module slots
		containerWindowType = {
			name = "module_slots"
			position = { x=0 y=0 }
			size = { width=100% height=100% }

			containerWindowType = {
				name = "fixed_heavy_battery_slot" # Name of a slot
				# other window attributes...

				containerWindowType = {
					name = "ship_heavy_battery_1" # Name of a module, its GFX name, or category name
					# other window attributes...
					
					# Any number of GUI elements; names are up to the discretion of the content creator.
				}

				containerWindowType = {
					name = "ship_heavy_battery@highlight" # Name of a module, its GFX name, or category name, plus the text "@highlight"
					# other window attributes...
					
					# Any number of GUI elements; names are up to the discretion of the content creator.
				}

				containerWindowType = {
					name = "@highlight" # Fallback highlight element when no other "@highlight" window matches
					# other window attributes...
					
					# Any number of GUI elements; names are up to the discretion of the content creator.
				}
			}

			# remaining module slots...
		}
	}

## Raid Map Icons

Map icons can be assigned in the following ways:

1. Automatically based on a string lookup of "GFX_raid_type_icon_" + [raid_type_name]
2. A custom scripted icon set through "custom_map_icon = [name]"

In both of the above cases, the system will also try to find a customized icon for the target building type, by appending the building template to the end of the string:
[1. or 2. from above] + "_" + [building_template_name]

# Raid Outcomes

These are defined in the *success_levels* part of the RaidType.

There are four levels: *failure*, *limited_success*, *success*, and *critical_success*.

The following effects are supported, taking *failure* as an example:

Note that *actor_effects* and *victim_effects* both use the same scope, but separating them allows for
easily separating them for UI purposes (showing separate lists of how the actor and victim country were affected by the outcome)

```
failure = {
    # Effects that should be listed as affecting the raiding country
    # Raid instance scope
    actor_effects = {
        # Can run raid instance scope effects
        raid_add_unit_experience = 100

        # And also use the dynamic variables to change scope (see the variable list below)
		var:actor_country = {
			air_experience = 10
		}
    }

    # Effects that should be listed as affecting the raided country
    # Raid instance scope
    victim_effects = {
        var:victim_country = {
            add_relation_modifier = {
                target = var:ROOT.actor_country
                modifier = [...]
            }
        }

        var:target_state = {
            damage_building = {
                type = dam
                damage = 1 # levels of damage
                province = var:ROOT.target_province
            }
        }
    }

    # Division (unit) scope
    division_effects = {
        add_divisional_commander_xp = 10
    }

	# The percentage of additional equipment that gets destroyed
	# Default is 100%
	destroy_additional_equipment = 0.25
    custom_sound = SFX_ref [Optional] Custom sound effect to play for this outcome

    # Visual effect to spawn on the target province
    visual_effect = {
        entity = "nuke_entity" # name of the entity to spawn
        animation = "attack" # name of the entity animation state
    }
}

```

# Success Chance Formulas & Modifiers

"Success Chance Formulas" are essentially lists of different **modifiers** which can affect the probability of a certain
raid outcome. They are used in *success_factors* in the RaidType (see above). *success*, *critical* and *disaster* are all
scripted in the same way through this formula construct.

```
[success_formula] = {
    base = <value> # [Optional] A base chance of the outcome (default is 0.0)

    # Optional modifiers
    [modifier] = {
        weight = <value> # [Required] The maximum probability change applied by the modifier (positive or negative, additive)
        reference = <value> # [Optional] The value of the backing property at which the modifier will have full weight. Default is 1.0
        start_weight = <value> # [Optional] The weight of the modifier when the backing property is at 0.0 (or, instead, at start_reference if defined). Default is 0.0
        start_reference = <value> # [Optional] The value of the backing property at which the modifier will have 0 weight (or, instead, start_weight if defined).
    }
}
```

- *success* defines the probability of a raid being a success
- *critical* defines the probability of a successful raid being a critical success (conditional probability)
- *disaster* defines the probability of a raid being a disaster/critical failure (not conditional)

### List of modifiers:
- *prep_time*: The preparation progress. Reference values from 0.0 (no preparation) to 1.0 (full preparation).
- *experience*: The experience of the unit assigned to the raid. Reference values from 0.0-1.0
- *anti_air*: The anti-air defense value of the target state. Reference values e.g. from 0 to 5 (meaning 5 basic AA buildings)
- *resistance*: The amount of resistance in the target state. Reference values from 0 to 100
- *enemy_units*: The number of enemy divisions in the target province. For province-target missions ONLY.
- *air_superiority*: The air superiority score (fraction) of the actor country in the target region. Reference values from 0.0 to 1.0
- *naval_supremacy*: The naval supremacy score (fraction) of the actor country in the target sea zone. Reference values from 0.0 to 1.0
- *interception*: The number of enemy planes executing interception missions in the target region.
- *intel*: The amount of intel the actor country has on the target. Reference values depend on defines.

#### Air Units Only:
- *air_defence*: The air defense value of the air unit assigned to the raid. Typical reference values from 0 to 50
- *air_agility*: The air agility value of the air unit assigned to the raid. Typical reference values from 0 to 50
- *strategic_bomber*: The strategic bombing value of the air unit assigned to the raid. Reference values from 0 to 1
- *reliability*: The reliability (fraction) of the air unit assigned to the raid. Reference values from 0 to 1

#### Land Units Only:
- *recon*: The recon level of the land unit assigned to the raid, if there is one. Typical reference values from 0 to 10
- *organisation*: The organisation (absolute) of the land unit assigned to the raid, if there is one. Reference values from 0 to 100+
- *strength*: The strength (factor) of the land unit assigned to the raid, if there is one. Reference values from 0.0 to 1.0

Example of scripting the success factors for a raid type:
```
success_factors = {
    # Factors that determine the probability of a raid being successful
    success = {
        # The base chance of this outcome is 20%
        base = 0.5

        prep_time = {
            # As preparation progress approaches 1.0 (the default reference value), starting from 0.6,
            # gradually remove the penalty (from -30% to 0%)
            start_reference = 0.6
            start_weight = -0.3
            weight = 0
        }

        agility = {
            reference = 100.0
            # As air unit agility approaches 100 (as defined by the value above), increase chance by this value
            weight = 0.05
            # At 0 agility, the modifier will have negative effect.
            # The modifier will scale linearly, meaning at 50 agility, the modifier will be 0.
            start_weight = -0.05
        }

        reliability = {
            reference = 100.0
            # By defining a start reference, we can make the modifier have weight 0 until reliability reaches 50,
            # after which it will increase until it reaches 100
            start_reference = 50.0
            weight = 0.1
        }
    }

    # Factors that determine the probability of a successful raid being a critical success
    critical = {
        # The base chance of this outcome is 10%
        base = 0.1

        experience = {
            reference = 50.0
            # As unit experience approaches 50 (as defined by the value above), increase chance by this value
            weight = 0.05
        }
    }

    # Factors that determine the probability of a raid being a disaster (critical failure). Note that risk taking will impact disaster risk.
    disaster = {
        # The base chance of this outcome is 10%
        base = 0.1

        experience = {
            reference = 50.0
            # As unit experience approaches 50 (as defined by the value above), increase chance by this value
            weight = 0.05
        }
    }
}
```

# Raid Instance Effects

These are new effects that operate on the *Raid Instance* scope.

## Dynamic variables

The raid instance scope supports these variables:

```
var:actor_country
var:victim_country
var:target_state
var:target_province
```


### raid_damage_units

Damage the units performing the raid in scope (the attackers inflict losses).

Damage is applied to ground units while damage to plane is defined as the amount of planes lost.
If 'ratio = yes', then all damage / losses are applied as a fraction of the current amount.
For units, damage can be defined through one value 'damage' or separately through 'org_damage' and 'str_damage'

The unit damage defined in a similar way to the 'damage_units' effect, with plane losses also being definable.

```
raid_damage_units = {
    # Amount of damage inflicted to units
    damage = <value>
    # Amount of organization damage inflicted to units (overrides 'damage' for org)
    org_damage = <value>
    # Amount of strength damage inflicted to units (overrides 'damage' for str)
    str_damage = <value>
    # Amount of planes lost
    plane_loss = <value>
    # Whether the damage/losses should be applied as a fraction of the current amount
    ratio = yes/no
}

examples:

# Apply 50% damage to units
raid_damage_units = {
    damage = 0.5
    ratio = yes
}

# Apply 10 strength loss and 20 organization loss to units
raid_damage_units = {
    org_damage = 20
    str_damage = 10
}

# Lose 40% of all planes
raid_damage_units = {
    plane_loss = 0.4
    ratio = yes
}

# Lose 5 planes
raid_damage_units = {
    plane_loss = 5
}
```

### raid_add_unit_experience

Add experience to the units (e.g. divisions or air wings) performing the raid.
```
raid_add_unit_experience = <value> # The value is 0.0-1.0, representing progress towards the max level
```

example:

# Gain 25% progress towards the max level
raid_add_unit_experience = 0.25
```
Supports both explicit values and variables

# In the rework, all focuses will be in one document. We will only use shared focuses, to make moving and redesigning trees easier

# Focus filters to use (note: focus filters should also be used for maluses. Minor effects for flavour purposes should not be marked): 
# FOCUS_FILTER_INTERNAL_AFFAIRS - story events
# FOCUS_FILTER_INDUSTRY - industry (factories, output bonuses, consumer goods, resources)
# FOCUS_FILTER_POLITICAL - political power
# FOCUS_FILTER_STABILITY - stability
# FOCUS_FILTER_WAR_SUPPORT - war support
# FOCUS_FILTER_ARMY_BONUS - anything that adds to the army
# FOCUS_FILTER_AIRFORCE_BONUS - anything that adds to the airforce
# FOCUS_FILTER_NAVY_BONUS - anything that adds to the navy
# FOCUS_FILTER_MANPOWER - ponypower (not monthly population thought, too small of an effect)
# FOCUS_FILTER_RESEARCH - research slots, research speed bonuses, one-time bonuses for specific research
# FOCUS_FILTER_ANNEXATION - any wargoals/wars
# Please add appropriate filters when creating a focus. Do not add any additional filters, it will break the UI. If in doubt, ping me in Project Heartlands. Thank you! - HerrB

# To make future understanding of the code easier, when referencing a state id, please comment the state name for clarity. Thank you! - HerrB

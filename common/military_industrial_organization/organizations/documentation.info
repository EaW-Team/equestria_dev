# Military Industrial Organization (MIO) database
#
# MIOs are replacement for design companies.
# They give research bonuses, but most importantly they give bonuses to equipments (quality and production).
#
# 1 MIO is composed of 1 tree of unlockable traits.
# The list of equipment a MIO can match is set in the MIO.
# Then the equipment stat & production stat for the bonus is set in the traits.
# The bonus is the combinaison of the two - e.g. soft attack for infantry equipment.
# 
# Trait can also unlock modifier for the MIO itself - in that case the equipment type does not matter.
#
# See "game/common/defines/00_graphics.lua" for configuration of coloring of lines in the trait trees
# (for example, "TRAIT_LINE_ASSIGNED_COLOR").
#
# Example with all possible parts:
# my_MIO_token = {
#	name = loc_key # optional
#	# if name provided, use TAG_loc_key if it exists. if not use loc_key (where TAG is the tag of the MIO owner)
#	# if localization key TAG_my_MIO_token exists, use it 
#	# else use loc key my_MIO_token
#	# loc key may use scripted loc, scope will be set with this MIO
#
#	icon = GFX_key # optional
#	# if icon provided, use GFX_key
#	# if gfx key GFX_TAG_my_MIO_token exists, use it (where TAG is the tag of the MIO owner)

#	# else use GFX_idea_unknown
#
#	allowed = { ... } # mandatory

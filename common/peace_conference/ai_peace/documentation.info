# Scripted AI desire for peace actions. This affects AI behavior but not the cost.

# *** How to access data from the peace action ***
# ROOT - Negotiator country (who is doing the negotiation)
# FROM - Taker country (who will be the owner after the conference)
# FROM.FROM - Giver country (who was the owner before the conference)
# FROM.FROM.FROM - State (iff peace action refers to a state)
# You might have to use e.g. ROOT.FROM to access the variable from inside another scope

# Possible peace action types
# - take_states
# - puppet
# - force_government
# - liberate

# peace_ai_desires = {
#    # All AI desires that are active for a peace action are summed. A desire that ends up at 0 or lower means the AI won't take the action.
#
#    arbitrary_name_for_the_desire = {
#
#        peace_action_type = force_government  # For which action types should the AI desire be active. Can take a single type or an array of types, e.g. { puppet liberate }
#
#        enable = {  # Determines when this desire should be active for a peace action. Can contain any trigger, including the peace conference-specific ones.
#            # Note that some things (e.g. diplomatic relations, state ownership, etc) are not updated during a peace conference but instead before or after. Use the peace conference-specific triggers (trigger names starting with pc_xxx, e.g. pc_is_puppeted_by) to check for things that happen during a conference.
#
#            ROOT = { has_government = democratic }  # checks if negotiator is democratic
#
#            ROOT.FROM = { tag = AUS }  # Checks if the taker is Austria
#
#            ROOT.FROM.FROM.FROM = { is_core_of = AUS }  # Checks if the state targeted by the peace action is a core of Austria
#
#        }
#
